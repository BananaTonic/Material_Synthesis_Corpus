Conclusions
In summary, we devised a hierarchical modification strategy to vary the number of proton sources and hopping sites for the improvement of proton conductivity in a stable MOF model system, in which the post-synthetic materials and membranes finally exhibited superprotonic conductivity and outstanding long-term stability, surpassing those of the reported proton conducting MOF materials. Furthermore, the membrane was used to assemble an H2/O2 fuel cell, and the maximum power density was 17.5 mW cmâˆ’2. Most importantly, we believe that this strategy can be used further for the development of more stable and high-performance MOF-based proton conductors. Moreover, such strategic hierarchical improvisation of proton conductivity in MOFs can provide an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms for the development of next-generation PEMs and solid electrolytes.
