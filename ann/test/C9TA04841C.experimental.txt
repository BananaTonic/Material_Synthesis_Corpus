Computational methods
First-principles calculations were conducted within the formalism of spin-polarization density functional theory (DFT) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of the exchange–correlation function as formulated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof. The valence electron–ion interaction was treated by the projector augmented wave (PAW) potential in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). Wave functions were expanded in a plane-wave basis set up to a kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV. Brillouin-zone integrations were performed by using the Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling scheme with a 3 × 4 × 2 grid. The convergence of total energy with respect to the kinetic energy cutoff and k-point sampling has been carefully examined. The convergence criterion of energy and structural relaxation were set as less than 1.0 × 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. Minimization of the total energy was realized with full relaxation of the atomic positions and cell parameters for each structure. The crystal structures during the electrochemical decomposition are obtained using the USPEX-META program. The Gaussian height and weight were 2600 Å3 kbar and 0.6 Å respectively. Minimum energy path calculations between two optimized configurations each with four Li ion vacancies were completed using the NEB method where the migration path is divided into several equidistant configurations known as images.
Experimental methods
High-purity (≥99.9%) LiOH, La2O5, and ZrO2 powders were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio of Li7La3Zr2O12; subsequently, the reaction products were pressed into pellets and sintered at 1200 °C for 36h while the samples were covered with the same mother powder. The phase composition of LLZO ceramic was measured by XRD (Bruker-D8 Advance) and the surface morphology of the polished samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (TM3030). The electrochemical stability of the samples was measured by LSV (Potentiostat Galvanostat EIS analyzer, Princeton PARSTAT 4000). The samples were gold plated before testing.
