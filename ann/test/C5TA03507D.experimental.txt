Proton exchange membranes (PEMs), efficient and environmentally friendly, have been extensively studied because of their great potential in energy conversion devices.1 In particular, Nafion has been widely used because it exhibits a good chemical stability and favourable performance under mild conditions.2 However, evidence shows that Nafion suffers a lot from water losses at high temperatures, resulting in a decrease in the proton conductivity. A lot of work has shown that inorganic–organic hybrid PEMs exhibit a good proton conductivity at low humidity even at high temperatures. Amongst the organic modifiers, graphene oxide (GO), a two-dimensional (2D) layered material with epoxy, hydroxyl, and carboxyl groups on the surface and edge, has received increasing attention. Endeavours have been made to study GO3,4 and it has been found that the oxygen-containing functional groups from GO can not only donate protons but also transfer protons.5–7 Besides directly using GO as a PEM filler, incorporating functionalized GO into a PEM matrix has been reported as well.6,8–14 Chen et al.6 sulfonated GO and found that the S-GO/Nafion composite membrane showed significant improvement in the proton conductivity at 25% relative humidity (RH). Wang et al.12 explored the performance enhancement of a hybrid PEM caused by polydopamine modified GO. The electrostatic attraction between P-GO and the polymer matrix facilitates proton transport. Although GO-incorporated hybrid PEMs have made remarkable progress, some problems need to be noticed. For instance, GO sheets easily stack together, resulting in the proton path being highly dependent on the accommodation of interlayer water and being easily influenced by interlayer interactions. Hayami et al.15–17 found that the monolayer GO sheet exhibited a proton conductivity as high as ∼10−2 S cm−1, much higher than that of bulk GO (∼10−4 S cm−1) or acidulated GO (∼10−5 S cm−1). Jiang et al. prepared freestanding sulfonated GO papers by vacuum filtration and found that the proton conduction by in-plane was better than that by through-plane.18,19
These reports imply that monolayer GO has a huge potential in the area of PEMs. The key to achieving high-performance PEMs is to disperse GO in a polymer matrix and keep the proton conduction path free from interferences caused by nearby sheets. A feasible way is the functionalization of GO. By introducing functional groups or structures on the GO surface or edge, the proton transfer process can be quickened.
A type of modifier worth considering is metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), an outstanding class of crystalline porous material,20 which has attracted worldwide attention because of the high surface area, regular structure, and so on.21 MOFs have been widely used in a lot of areas, such as catalysis, gas storage,22 separation technology, etc.23–26 However, it has not been a long time since their application as proton conductors in PEMs was developed. Xu et al.27,28 first prepared a MOF-incorporated PEM and studied its proton conductivity at high humidity and the proton transfer mechanism. Zhu et al.29 fabricated MOF–polymer composite membranes, which could be operated at low humidity, and the results showed an improvement in the proton conductivity.
Considering the advantages of monolayer GO and MOFs, we synthesized a metal–organic framework–graphene oxide composite (MOF@GO) by an in situ growth method. The as-synthesized MOF@GO has a monolayer GO structure with MOFs decorated on the GO sheet's surface. To the best of our knowledge, research on PEMs modified by a MOF@GO composite remains almost untouched, as applications of MOF@GO composites are more concerned with adsorption.30–34 Moreover, this work investigates the synergetic effects between GO and MOF, which extraordinarily enhance the PEM's proton conductivity.
In this study, we present the porous framework of ZIF-8 (Zn(MeIM)2, MeIM = 2-methylimidazole), which has good thermal and chemical stabilities with large pores (11.6 Å in diameter) connected through small apertures (about 3.4 Å).35 According to Rao et al.,30 ZIF-8@GO can be prepared by a simple route at room temperature. Fig. 1A shows the morphology of ZIF-8@GO. The in situ growth of ZIF-8 on the surface of the GO sheet is consistent with what has been observed in previous reports.30 Besides, the size of ZIF-8 in ZIF-8@GO is relatively uniform. Thanks to the oxygen-containing groups of GO, especially the carboxyl groups, ZIF-8 can grow in situ on the GO sheet. In detail, oxygen-containing groups anchor the Zn2+ ion, and therefore, the GO sheet provides a platform for the nucleation and growth of ZIF-8.36

Bonding interactions between ZIF-8 and GO are evidenced from the FT-IR spectra (Fig. 1B). In the spectrum of GO, the peak at 1724 cm−1 is ascribed to the CO stretching vibration of the carboxyl group. The intensity of this peak decreases in the spectrum of ZIF-8@GO, which indicates that the carboxyl groups of GO interact with Zn2+. Besides, new peaks at 3137 and 2960–2860 cm−1, attributed to C–H in ZIF-8, appear in the spectrum of ZIF-8@GO, as well as the peak at 1581 cm−1 assigned to CN in the imidazole ring in ZIF-8.37 Moreover, new absorbance peaks at 754 and 688 cm−1, corresponding to Zn–O and Zn–N, respectively, emerge, further confirming the growth of ZIF-8 on the GO sheet.38
Fig. 1C shows the XRD patterns of ZIF-8@GO, ZIF-8 prepared in our lab and ZIF-8 by simulation. They are almost identical, which is consistent with the previous report.39 Elemental analysis and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) reveal the presence of Zn, O, N and C elements in ZIF-8@GO (Fig. S1). TGA and DTG measurements suggest some oxygen-containing groups remain in ZIF-8@GO and the thermal stability of ZIF-8@GO is better than that of ZIF-8 (Fig. S2).
The FT-IR spectrum of the hybrid membrane incorporated with ZIF-8@GO (Fig. S3) does not show a big difference compared to that of the recast Nafion, except that the peaks at 1211 and 1153 cm−1, corresponding to –CF2– asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations, shift to 1206 and 1150 cm−1. Fig. S4A shows the XRD profiles of the aforementioned membranes. The peak intensity for the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion hybrid membrane decreases obviously, which suggests that Nafion in the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion hybrid membrane has a lower crystallinity because of the interactions between ZIF-8@GO and Nafion.40 The thermal stability improves a little in ZIF-8@GO/Nafion, as confirmed in Fig. S4B. The backbone decomposition temperature of the hybrid membrane is around 475 °C, which is higher than that of the recast Nafion (∼450 °C). The results suggest that interactions between ZIF-8@GO and Nafion not only decrease the hybrid membrane's crystallinity but also improve its thermal stability.
Proton conductivity is an important factor to evaluate the performance of PEMs. In this work, the proton conductivities of the recast Nafion and hybrid membranes at 40% RH are shown in Fig. 2A. The proton conductivity of the recast Nafion membrane decreases dramatically when the temperature is higher than 90 °C. This phenomenon results from water losses from Nafion. Interestingly, the proton conductivities of the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion membranes are found to increase with the rise in temperature. In particular, the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion-1 hybrid membrane displays the highest values. Its conductivity is 0.21 ± 0.026 S cm−1 under the conditions of 80 °C and 40% RH, 15 times as that of the recast Nafion.

Moreover, ZIF-8@GO/Nafion-1 displays a proton conductivity as high as 0.28 ± 0.058 S cm−1 at 120 °C and 40% RH, almost 55 times higher than that of the recast Nafion (0.005 S cm−1), and even bigger than previous reports concerning GO modified PEMs (Table S1). However, the hybrid membrane's conductivity decreases when the loading of ZIF-8@GO in Nafion increases to 1.5% (w/w). This may be caused by the agglomeration of ZIF-8@GO (Fig. S5).
The ultra-high conductivity of the ZIF@GO/Nafion hybrid membranes may result from the synergetic effect of ZIF-8@GO, specifically, a better water retention capability and the unique monolayer GO sheet structure.
Fig. 2B shows the water uptake measurements of the recast Nafion and ZIF-8@GO/Nafion-1. At 60 °C, the membrane incorporated with ZIF-8@GO has a relatively low water uptake compared to the recast Nafion membrane. This may be due to the hydrophobicity of ZIF-8. However, the hybrid membrane loses a small amount of water and has a much higher water uptake than that of the recast Nafion at 120 °C and 40% RH. This interesting phenomenon may partly elucidate the reason why the conductivity of ZIF-8@GO/Nafion does not decrease with the rise in temperature. On one hand, the hydrogen bonding interactions are formed between –N–H from the terminating imidazole linker,41,42 the oxygen-containing groups remaining on GO, and water molecules. On the other hand, ZIF-8 may trap some water molecules in the cages. As a result, the water conditions in ZIF-8@GO/Nafion are likely to be immune from the elevation of temperature. Therefore, the proton conductivity in the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion hybrid membrane does not show an obvious decrease but, instead, it shows an enhancement because the protons migrate faster at a high temperature.
By calculation, the proton activation energy values at 40% RH for Nafion and ZIF-8@GO/Nafion are 34.5 and 13.2 kJ mol−1, respectively. The lower activation energy of ZIF-8@GO/Nafion indicates that ZIF-8@GO facilitates the rapid migration of protons through the hybrid membrane.
The humidity-dependent proton conductivity of the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion hybrid membrane was also investigated in this work. The results are shown in Fig. 3. A decline in the proton conductivity is observed when the humidity is lower than 40% RH. However, the proton conductivity is not very sensitive to the humidity over the RH range of 40% to 100%.

This can be attributed to the bonding interactions between ZIF@GO and the sulfonic acid groups of Nafion. At a high humidity, these interactions may partly impair the membrane's water uptake ability and inhibit the swelling of the ionic cluster. This suppresses the improvement in the proton conduction, which is mainly dependent on hydrated protons via a vehicle-type mechanism. However, at a low humidity, these interactions can reduce the enlarged hindrance of the proton path caused by the shrinkage of the ionic clusters and promote proton transport in a succession via a Grotthuss-type mechanism.
Another factor that accounts for the ultra-high proton conductivity of the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion hybrid membrane is the unique monolayer structure. Unlike bulk GO, ZIF-8@GO can effectively protect proton or water migrations from interferences by interlayer sheets.15Fig. 4A and B show that ZIF-8@GO disperses well in the Nafion matrix and the morphology of ZIF-8@GO in the Nafion matrix conforms with the morphology when dispersed in DMF. This further confirms our speculation that the incorporation of ZIF-8 effectively inhibits the aggregation of GO sheets, thereby benefiting the formation of the monolayer GO structure.

Fig. 4C presents the temperature-dependent proton conductivities of the Nafion based membranes incorporated with different materials – GO, ZIF-8, ZIF-8&amp;GO (a mixture of ZIF-8 and GO) and ZIF-8@GO. It can be noticed that ZIF-8 and GO also improve the hybrid membrane’s proton conductivity. ZIF-8, with –N–H from the terminating imidazole linker,41,42 may donate protons and interact with Nafion or water, thus reducing the space hindrance of the proton path. Oxygen containing groups on the GO sheet's surface and edge can retain water and serve as a proton conductor.5 Therefore, ZIF-8 and GO can promote proton transport through the membrane via a Grotthuss-type mechanism at low humidity. Besides, the phase morphologies of both hybrid membranes (see Fig. S6) indicate that the sizes of the ionic clusters are bigger than that in the recast Nafion. However, the ionic clusters in ZIF-8@GO/Nafion are the most connected and the biggest.
Accordingly, it can be found that the improvement in the proton conductivity of ZIF-8@GO/Nafion is the biggest, which means that ZIF-8@GO prepared through the in situ growth method is a great modification. As ZIF-8 grows in situ on GO, sheet stacking caused by interlayer attractions can be effectively inhibited. Therefore, the obtained ZIF-8@GO with a monolayer structure can highly promote the motion of protons or water and keep it free from the interferences caused by interlayer interactions, thus resulting in a faster proton movement. Besides, both faces of GO have oxygen containing functional groups, which further improve the proton conduction.
Furthermore, the sieving effect due to the aperture size of ZIF-8 in ZIF-8@GO has little effect on the proton transfer process or water diffusion (kinetic diameter 2.6–3.2 Å),42 but it may suppress the methanol permeation (kinetic diameter 3.8 Å). As a result, the methanol pathway becomes more tortuous.
As shown in Fig. S7A, the methanol permeation in ZIF-8@GO/Nafion is decreased compared with that in the recast Nafion, although a slight increase is observed when the loading of ZIF-8@GO is higher. This may originate from the rigidity of ZIF-8@GO, which induces defects in the hybrid membrane.43 The ZIF-8&amp;GO/Nafion-1 hybrid membrane exhibits the worse suppression of methanol permeation, resulting from the poor dispersion of ZIF-8 and GO, as both tend to aggregate. The selectivity, ratio of proton conductivity to methanol permeability, is shown in Fig. S7B. This demonstrates that the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion-1 hybrid membrane has the highest selectivity, 41 × 105 S s cm−3, 21 times higher than that of the recast Nafion (2.4 × 105 S s cm−3) at 40 °C.
In this work, ZIF-8@GO was prepared by an in situ growth method and then incorporated into a Nafion matrix. The H-bonding interactions formed by ZIF-8, as well as GO, and H2O endowed the ZIF-8@GO/Nafion hybrid membrane with a good water retention capability. Besides, the unique monolayer structure of ZIF-8@GO facilitated a rapid transfer of water or protons, and promoted its performance greatly. Even at 120 °C and 40% RH, ZIF-8@GO/Nafion-1 displayed a proton conductivity as high as 0.28 ± 0.058 S cm−1, almost 55 times higher than that of the recast Nafion (0.005 S cm−1). Meanwhile, the membrane's methanol permeation and activation energy decreased. This research provides a facile and effective method to achieve high-performance PEMs, which can be operated at low humidity, and, at the same time, provides a new application for the ZIF-8@GO material.
