Conclusion
Within this report, we have demonstrated the use of the oxidant species iron(iii) trifluoromethane sulfonate with the vapour phase polymerization of EDOT. The optimization of the polymerization was achieved by investigating the components of the oxidant solution including a copolymer and the Fe(OTf)3. The concentration of the oxidant, chemical nature of the solvent and polymerization conditions (temperature and time) were optimized to obtain an electrical conductivity as high as 3800 S cm−1. After a post-treatment with H2SO4, the conductivity is further enhanced to 4500 S cm−1. The electrical conductivity and optical transparency of the optimised PEDOT:OTf rivalled that of commercially transparent metal oxides with an acceptable electrochemical stability, thus suggesting their use as a transparent electrode in optoelectronic devices. XPS reveals that the acid treatment is accompanied by an increase in the oxidation level; which explains the positive effect on the conductivity as well as on the optical absorption in the visible region of the solar spectrum. The X-ray diffraction analysis supported by theoretical modelling indicates that the acid treatment with H2SO4 does not disturb the π–π stacking between the PEDOT chains. Hence, the higher oxidation level calculated through XPS and a higher order of crystallinity obtained by the acid treatment are deemed responsible for the higher conductivity measurements.
