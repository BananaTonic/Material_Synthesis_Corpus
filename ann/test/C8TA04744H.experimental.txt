Synthesis of highly conductive PEDOT
Vapor phase polymerization is a synthetic route where a solution of the oxidant Fe(OTf)3 and the copolymer PEG-PPG-PEG dissolved in an alcohol are spin-coated on an insulating substrate. The thin film of the composite PEG-PPG-PEG/Fe(OTf)3 is then exposed to EDOT vapor for a certain time, temperature and pressure. Once the PEDOT:OTf film is formed, the remaining iron salt, Fe(OTf)2 and unreacted Fe(OTf)3 are dissolved in the cleaning procedure. The composition of the oxidant solution is one of the key ingredient to optimize the electrical conductivity of the resulting PEDOT:OTf. In general, an increased oxidant concentration produces a thicker layer of CP in VPP due to more nucleation sites and the monomer having more oxidant available for the polymerization.2,30 However, no report has yet investigated the effect of the Fe(OTf)3 concentration on the resulting optical and electrical properties of the CP. Many reports have stated that a slower polymerization rate in VPP provides the CP chains a suitable time in order to stack and orient themselves optimally, permitting favourable electrical properties.5,6,8 Therefore, one may assume that a lower oxidant concentration may result in better electrical conductivity. Although if the polymerization becomes too slow the CP film may not survive the washing step subsequent to the VPP step.
Fig. 2a displays the electrical conductivity and absorption spectrum for various concentrations of oxidant in ethanol. As expected the larger the oxidant concentration, the thicker the film as indicated by the absorbance (3 wt% = 30.7 nm, α = 0.088, 6 wt% = 90.2 nm, α = 0.14, 12 wt% = 206.2 nm, α = 0.32). The lowest concentration of 3 wt% Fe(OTf)3 leads to the highest conductivity and lowest absorbance spectra in the visible region. With an acid treatment (1 M H2SO4, see the Experimental section for details), the conductivity of the 3 wt% sample is increased to 4471 S cm−1 with an absorbance below 0.2 (the absorbance spectra for the oxidant concentration and solvent variation of the acid treated films are shown in Fig. SI1 and SI2), showing its potential as a transparent conductor material. Indeed, ITO has an electrical conductivity of 4000 S cm−1 and an absorbance of &lt;0.1 at 550 nm in the visible region.31,32 The surface properties were also investigated (Fig. SI3) and a RMS roughness of 4.89 nm for the 3 wt% sample over a 3 × 3 μm2 area was obtained showing that the film is smooth; which is a prerequisite for opto-electrical applications, thus avoiding short circuits between thin semiconducting films upon deposition of the top electrode in light emitting diodes or solar cells.
VPP parameter investigation. (a) Fe(OTf)3 concentration variation and its effects on electrical conductivity before and after acid treatment of PEDOT:OTf, together with UV-Vis spectra of the pristine films. The oxidant was composed of 20 wt% PEG-PPG-PEG in ethanol with various Fe(OTf)3 amounts. (b) Alcohol based solvent variation and the effects on electrical conductivity before and after acid treatment of PEDOT:OTf, together with UV-Vis spectra of the pristine films. The oxidant was composed of 3 wt% Fe(OTf)3 and 20 wt% PEG-PPG-PEG in various alcohol based solvents. The polymerization temperature was set at 60 °C and polymerization was performed for 30 minutes.
The chemical nature of the solvent is another important parameter to control since it affects both the wettability of the oxidant solution on a substrate and the morphology of the PEG-PPG-PEG/Fe(OTf)3 composite film. A previous report10 investigating Fe(OTf)3 employed mixtures of ethanol and various other organic solvents such as THF, DMF, DMSO and NMP; however, the mixtures of these solvents with ethanol and the neat organic solvents either did not dissolve the oxidant or resulted in poor wettability. A separate report investigated the effect of various organic solvent additions to the Fe(Tos)3 oxidant solution, but none outperformed the ethanol solution.33 Alcohol based solvents have been used extensively in the VPP of EDOT3,4,34,35 and several of them were trialled for the best electrical and optical properties of PEDOT. Similar to the studies on PEDOT:Tos, we show that ethanol provides the highest electrical conductivity for PEDOT:Tof before (3250 ± 122 S cm−1) and after acid treatment (4430 ± 168 S cm−1) (Fig. 2b). The surface properties were acceptable for all solvents with only methanol producing a RMS roughness of above 5 nm (Fig. SI4). The surface roughness of the glass substrates was measured to be an average of 3.1 nm (Fig. SI5) which would influence the overall surface roughness. The surface roughness values for the PEDOT samples which still possess an acceptable value for organic electronics could be improved to make this material even more suitable as an electrode material. Interestingly, we see a correlation between the thickness of the film, proportional to the absorbance in the spectrum, and the ebullition point of the alcohols (methanol: 65 °C; ethanol: 78 °C; butanol: 118 °C; hexanol: 157 °C). This can be attributed to the presence of the remaining solvent trapped in the PEG-PPG-PEG/Fe(OTf)3 films. Therefore, during the polymerization, the monomer vapour does not react with as many oxidant molecules due to the presence of alcohol molecules still remaining in the oxidant film. The use of the longest alcohol trialled, hexanol, resulted in a PEDOT film of the lowest absorbance (Fig. 2b) with an average thickness of 15.8 nm. This sample was not the most impressive in terms of electrical conductivity (2655 S cm−1 after acid treatment compared to 4011 S cm−1 for ethanol) suggesting the importance of the removal of absorbed alcohol molecules prior to polymerization or the negative effect of the high boiling point solvent on the morphology of the oxidant films.
Both polymerization time and temperature were also investigated and the results can be seen in the ESI (Fig. SI6 and SI7). From the electrical conductivity and general appearance of the PEDOT films an optimal polymerization time of 10 minutes with a polymerization temperature of 30 °C was set for all future experiments. This optimization is most likely a result of the polymerization progressing slowly enough to provide the growing polymer chains time to align and stack in an optimised orientation while still being able to endure the washing step. The use of vacuum was also shown to be of utmost importance with a dramatic reduction in electrical conductivity from 4000 S cm−1 to 1000 S cm−1 upon pressure increase to atmospheric pressure (Fig. SI8). It is thought that the greater control of the water content under vacuum conditions is responsible for the high conductivity. The reproducibility of the optimised conditions is acceptable with only a minimal variation between samples (Fig. SI9) and between batches (±225 S cm−1 maximum) (Fig. SI10) giving an electrical conductivity of approximately 4500 S cm−1.
The optimized PEDOT:OTf has enormous potential as a transparent conductor with its high conductivity and high transparency within the visible spectrum. Comparing the new PEDOT:OTf shown in this report to other transparent electrode materials such as PEDOT:Tos and ITO coated glass substrates highlights the potential of the PEDOT:OTf. In terms of conductivity the PEDOT:OTf (4500 S cm−1) is superior to all the materials, even the commercial ITO substrate (4000 S cm−131,32) (the highest recorded ITO conductivity may be superior but not commercially available ITO). The optical spectra of the PEDOT:OTf are only slightly lower than those of ITO across the measured region (Fig. 3b) and higher within the UV region. Fig. 3a shows the compared materials and their transparency over the Linkoping University logo. Absorbance and normalized absorbance to material thickness can be found in the ESI (Fig. SI11).

Stability investigation
Throughout this report the properties of the PEDOT films have been presented before and after acid treatment. One question that has been foreseen is the stability of the films after the acid treatment. Acid treatments are thought to modify polymer chains which may lead to faster degradation under ambient conditions. Interestingly, the stability with regard to electrical stability under ambient conditions over time was good with only a small increase of resistance over 200 hours and the acid treated films follow the same trend as that of the pristine films (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, after a series of redox cycles the acid treated PEDOT:OTf and the pristine film were equally stable over 1000 cycles (Fig. 4b). There were also no observable changes in the morphology of the films before and after the acid treatment as seen in Fig. SI12. The optical properties were also examined over time and no degradation was observed over 150 hours in the ambient atmosphere. The acid treated film has a lower absorption at 900 nm than the pristine film and it is associated with an increase in the oxidation level upon acidic treatment,36 suppressing any residual polarons, and building bipolaron networks.7 (Fig. 4c).

Oxidation state
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provides a convenient method to study the chemical environment of polymeric samples in thin film form. Within our system both the PEDOT and OTf molecules contain sulphur atoms in their chemical structure. However, the difference in binding energy allows the sulphur to be differentiated from the two molecules allowing the oxidation/doping level to be estimated from the S(2p) peaks within the XPS spectra. The S(2p) signal from one sulfur gives a doublet with a separation of 2 eV and an intensity ratio of 2 : 1; we will mention only the position of the main component of the doublet. The sulphur signal for PEDOT originates at 163.5 eV (Peak 1) with an asymmetric peak tail at higher binding energies corresponding to the positive charges present on the PEDOT chains which are partially delocalized on the sulphur atoms.37 The main component of the second doublet at approximately 168 eV (Peak 3) corresponds to the Tof dopant molecule. The binding energy is higher than that of the sulfur in the thiophene ring because it is surrounded by three electronegative oxygen atoms on the sulfonate group. Note that the sulphur originating from the HSO4− anions inserted in the PEDOT film, upon acid treatment by ion exchange with the OTf anion, is assumed to overlap with the S(2p) signal of the OTf anion (Fig. 5b). The authors acknowledge that after acid treatment the PEDOT is doped with HSO4− anions rather than OTf anions but will be referred to as acid treated PEDOT–OTf for simplicity. The HSO4− anions lose their negative charge while coordinating with the positively charged PEDOT chains. The acid anion has previously been shown to replace the OTf anion using this acid treatment.10 Using this information the oxidation level was calculated to be 25% and 32% for the pristine and acid treated PEDOT:OTf samples, respectively. This is in agreement with the acid treatment of PEDOT:Tos accompanied by an ion exchange and an increase in the oxidation level.36

The XPS results on the increased oxidation level in the case of the acid-treated PEDOT film partially justify the increased conductivity compared to the pristine PEDOT. However, the structure of the pristine and acid-treated films should be also investigated in order to fully understand the origins of this increase in conductivity of the acid treated film. Therefore, GIWAXS experiments have been carried out to analyse the structure of the pristine and acid treated PEDOT:OTf films.
GIWAXS and molecular modelling
The (qr, qz) wedge-corrected scattering images of the polymer films are shown in Fig. SI13, while the corresponding 1D intensity vs. q scattering patterns are presented in (Fig. 6a). Despite the limitations in accessing the q-range below 0.4 Å−1, a very intense diffraction peak is evident at q* = 0.45 Å−1, followed by a lower one at 0.9 Å−1. The relative position of these peaks (q*, 2q*) and their decreasing intensity suggest that they belong to the same family of reflections and that they correspond to an ordered lamellar structure. Following the interpretation by Aasmundtveit et al.,38 we assign these peaks to the (h00) family of reflections of the PEDOT crystallites, the (h00) direction being perpendicular to the PEDOT backbone (c-axis) and along the EDOT plane direction. Therefore, the corresponding lattice size is α = 2π/q* = 2π/q100 = 14.0 Å. This size corresponds to that reported by Aasmundtveit et al.38 for the distance between PEDOT chains along the α direction and with the counterions in between as depicted in Fig. 6e and f. Besides the (h00) family, a broad peak is present at around q = 1.77 Å−1. It can be associated with diffraction that arises from a disordered π–π stacking. Therefore, it is assigned to the 020 peak38 (qπ–π in Fig. 6a). Note that the intensity of both the (100) and (020) peaks is higher in the case of the acid-treated film. Given the same dimensions and thicknesses of the two films, we conclude that the acid treatment results in more ordered films with higher crystallinity. This is the opposite as observed for PEDOT:Tos treated with HCl.36 This suggests that the larger size of the SO42−/HSO4− compared to the Cl− is favourable because of its more similar size to the OTf anions. As a result, during the acid treatment the ion exchange OTf− ↔ HSO4− does not disrupt the molecular order obtained during the polymerization.

Rectangular boxes in (e)and (f) show two neighbouring crystallites outlining the formation of the lamellar structure.
The experimental GIWAXS characterization of the pristine and acid treated films is consistent with the results of MD simulations when the X-ray diffraction pattern is obtained. The X-ray diffraction pattern and morphology of CPs are sensitive to the water content as experimentally shown for PEDOT:PSS39 and theoretically demonstrated by MD simulations for PEDOT:TOS.11 Thus, we obtained the X-ray diffraction pattern for each water evaporation step until matching the peak positions with the experimental 1D GIWAXS pattern, see Fig. SI14.Fig. 6a shows the calculated X-ray diffraction pattern of pristine and acid treated films, with a solvent content of 0 and 30 w/w %, respectively, for which the best agreement with the experimental patterns is obtained. In order to extract the crystallite size along the π–π direction, L020, the Sherrer equation40 is used for the experimental GIWAXS patterns,3L020 = 2πK/(Δqπ–π)where K ≈ 0.93 is the shape factor and Δqπ–π is the full width at half maximum of the (020) peak. To extract Δqπ–π the left side of the (020) peak was fitted to a Lorentz function, since its right side is associated with parasitic/background scattering, see Fig. 6a. The values of L020 obtained for the pristine and acid treated films are 20.5 and 22.1 Å respectively, and they correspond to 5.9 and 6.3 chains packed along the π–π stacking. This is confirmed by the calculation of the radial distribution functions, g(r), corresponding to the distances between the planes of PEDOT chains in the MD simulations (Fig. 6b). For pristine and acid treated films the radial distribution g(r) exhibits 5 and 6 r/rπ–π peaks, respectively, that correspond to crystallites consisting of 6 and 7 chains. The MD snapshots that show the π–π crystallites formed in the pristine and acid treated films are demonstrated in Fig. 6c and d. It is noteworthy that the π–π crystallite sizes captured in the simulations are in good agreement with the calculated radial distribution functions and with the L020 sizes obtained using the experimental GIWAXS patterns.
Besides the good agreement between experiment and simulation regarding the (020) peak, the calculated diffraction patterns of the pristine and the acid treated films align well with the (h00) peaks located at q ≈ 0.45 Å−1 and 0.90 Å−1. As discussed above, these peaks are related to the formation of a lamellar structure along the α-axis (h00 direction). This lamellar structure is well apparent in Fig. 6e and f for the pristine and acid treated PEDOT:OTf films, respectively. The organization of the crystallites into lamellae is highlighted by dashed squares. According to these MD snapshots, two lamellae are separated by a lamellar d-spacing ≈ 14 Å, which corresponds well to the d-spacing that is calculated based on the (100) peak at q ≈ 0.45 Å−1 from the calculated and experimental diffraction patterns (Fig. 6a). Moreover, the snapshots in Fig. 6e and f reveal a higher disorder in the bulk of the film for the pristine film rather than for the acid treated film, consistent with the lower intensity of the (100) peaks that were recorded experimentally for the pristine film. The simulated systems do not take into account the effect of the substrate and thus the calculated X-ray diffraction patterns exhibit less order in the α-lattice direction with lower intensities for the (h00) peak families. This feature of the effect of the substrate is very well known for similar semiconducting polymers.11,25 It is interesting to note that there is no observable shift in the diffraction peak between the HSO4− and the OTf anions since there is a van der Waals volume difference of 27% (Table SI1). However, the projected radius for both minimal and maximal showed no significant difference, which corresponds to the radius of the projected 2D circular area (Table SI1). Therefore, a diffraction peak shift may not appear in the spectra. The theoretical simulations presented above are a good indication that the increase in the experimental electrical conductivity of the acid-treated PEDOT:OTf films arises from an increase in crystallinity while still maintaining the π–π stacking.
