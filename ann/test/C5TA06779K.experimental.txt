3.Results and discussion
3.1.Structural characterization
XRD analysis of the as-prepared Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramic materials confirmed the formation of solid solutions with the K2NiF4-type structure. The compositions with x = 1.2–1.6 were phase-pure, while trace amounts of the NiO phase were observed in XRD patterns of NdSrNiO4−δ ceramics (Fig. 1) even after additional calcinations of precursor powder for up to 70 h at 1230 °C in oxygen flow. The intensity of NiO reflections was however less than 1% of intensity of the strongest (103) reflection of the K2NiF4-type phase.

XRD patterns of all compositions were successfully indexed using the tetragonal I4/mmm space group, in agreement with the literature data.16,17,20,21 Refined lattice parameters and unit cell volume (Table 1) showed very minor variations with the strontium content and followed the trend reported in the literature:17,21 in the studied compositional range, a and c parameters show the maximum and minimum, respectively, for x = 1.4, with the minimum tetragonality ratio c/a for this composition.

As an example, Fig. 2 demonstrates XRD patterns of a composition with the highest strontium content. Thermal analysis confirmed the absence of phase transitions under these conditions: no thermal events can be observed in DSC curves on temperature cycling within the sensitivity of DSC equipment. Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ exhibit strongly anisotropic lattice expansion on heating: faster elongation along the c axis as compared to the a–b plane (Fig. 3). Furthermore, increasing the strontium content results in progressing deviations of temperature dependencies of the lattice parameters from the linear behavior and eventually even in a lattice contraction in the basal plane at higher temperatures. Such behavior originates from the oxygen nonstoichiometry variations, as discussed below, and has an effect on thermomechanical and electrical properties of these materials.

The as-prepared ceramic samples were comparatively porous, with a density of 79–89% of the theoretical (Table 1). Fig. 4A–C illustrate microstructures of sintered ceramics; the grain sizes were in the range of ∼1.3–9.0 μm. The difficulties in the preparation of dense polycrystalline Ln2−xSrxNiO4−δ samples with x ≥ 1.0 were noted earlier in literature reports.28 Attempts to fabricate dense ceramics in this work were not successful as well. Increasing sintering temperature to 1350–1400 °C resulted in a rapid grain growth and embrittlement of the samples. Most likely, this is associated with the strongly anisotropic expansion of the grains, especially at higher temperatures, producing significant stresses in polycrystalline samples on cooling and promoting the development of multiple, mostly intergranular, cracks (Fig. 4D).

3.2.Oxygen nonstoichiometry under oxidizing conditions
Fig. 5 shows variations of oxygen nonstoichiometry in Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ under oxidizing conditions. The compositions with x = 1.0–1.4 tend to oxygen stoichiometry or even a slight oxygen excess at lower temperatures, &lt;500–700 °C, while Nd0.4Sr1.6NiO4−δ is oxygen deficient in the entire studied temperature range. On heating, all materials lose oxygen and exhibit oxygen hypostoichiometry; the onset of oxygen losses shifts to lower temperature with increasing strontium content. The range of oxygen nonstoichiometry variations progressively increases with the strontium substitution and with reducing oxygen partial pressure. For x = 1.6, oxygen deficiency δ at 1000 °C in air is as high as 0.45 oxygen atoms per formula unit (nearly 1/8 of regular oxygen sites are vacant). Although experimental determination of ionic conductivity was not possible due to the porosity of ceramic samples, high concentration of oxygen vacancies implies a significant level of oxygen-ionic transport in these materials which should improve with the strontium content.

Acceptor-type substitution by strontium into the neodymium sublattice of Nd2NiO4+δ can be compensated by changing the concentration of oxygen defects (interstitial oxygen ions or vacancies in the oxygen sublattice) and/or by generation of electron–holes. Considering Ni3+ and Ni4+ equivalent to electron–holes residing on nickel cations and neglecting interstitial oxygen, electroneutrality conditions for strontium-rich Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ can be expressed as1where p is the concentration of electron–holes per formula unit. Fig. 6 shows the average formal valence of nickel cations and electron–hole concentration in Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ in air calculated from the oxygen nonstoichiometry data assuming that oxygen ions are doubly charged. The results show that the mixed Ni2+/Ni3+ state is expected only at temperature above ∼750–800 °C. At lower temperature, the average oxidation state of nickel cations tends to 3+ in NdSrNiO4, while for other compositions nickel should be in the mixed 3+/4+ oxidation state. One should note that nickel in the 4+ oxidation state is rather unusual for oxide materials. This can be expected, for instance, in perovskite-type ANiO3 (A = Sr and Ba),29,30 and also was evidenced in LaGa0.65Mg0.15Ni0.20O3−δ under oxidizing conditions31 and in La0.9Sr0.1NiO3±δ prepared under elevated oxygen pressure.32 On the other hand, it is argued that equilibria 2Ni4+ + O2− ↔ Ni3+ + O−3Ni3+ + O2− ↔ Ni2+ + O−are shifted to the right in Ruddlesden–Popper Ln2−xSrxNiO4±δ nickelates28,33 or, in other words, electron–holes may reside in O 2p rather than in Ni 3d orbitals; this seems to be supported by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy data.34–36

One should emphasize also that all studied Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics demonstrated very fast re-equilibration with a gas atmosphere on temperature cycling in the high-temperature range (&gt;600 °C) under oxidizing conditions, as demonstrated by thermogravimetric studies in air and in O2 (see ESI, Fig. S1). No hysteresis in oxygen nonstoichiometry curves was observed during heating/cooling cycles.
3.3.Structural changes in inert atmosphere
Fig. 7 shows variations of oxygen nonstoichiometry in Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ in one heating/cooling cycle in argon flow at 25–1000 °C. As under oxidizing conditions, the oxides lose oxygen from the lattice on heating above ∼400 °C, although the extent of oxygen content variations is higher under reduced p(O2). Oxygen uptake on cooling was however comparatively small, at least partly due to the low oxygen concentration in the gas phase. After cooling, all samples exhibited noticeable oxygen deficiency increasing with the Sr content. Oxygen losses were accompanied by a decrease of average oxidation state of nickel cations which varied from 2.74+ for x = 1.0 to 2.36+ for x = 1.6 at room temperature.

Results of XRD analysis indicated that NdSrNiO3.87 preserves the tetragonal I4/mmm structure after this treatment. The splitting of several reflections in XRD patterns of other compositions suggested however a decrease of the lattice symmetry (Fig. 8). This splitting becomes more evident with increasing strontium content (and oxygen deficiency).

Neutron powder diffraction was employed to determine precisely the crystal structure of the reduced Nd0.4Sr1.6NiO4−δ sample. The room temperature pattern (Fig. 9A) revealed a substantial splitting of some of the reflections consistent with an orthorhombic metric (aO &gt; bO ≈ aT, cO ≈ cT) of the unit cell. This observation combined with the lack of any superstructure in both X-ray and neutron diffraction data pointed to the Immm subgroup as the primary candidate for the crystal structure symmetry of the reduced composition. The I4/mmm → Immm symmetry reduction takes into account the variation of the exx and eyy macroscopic strains and does not require any changes in the translation symmetry. There are no atomic displacement modes which can drive the symmetry change and the only relevant microscopic order parameter is an order–disorder type. This order parameter is a scalar function localized on the 4c(1/2,0,1/2) Wyckoff position of the tetragonal structure (Fig. 9B), which splits it into two sites 2d(1/2,0,1/2) and 2b(0,1/2,1/2) in the Immm subgroup. This scalar order parameter implies a different occupation probability for these positions which in turn means that the reduction procedure creates an oxygen-vacancy ordered structure. Indeed, the quantitative structure refinement confirmed the orthorhombic Immm model (Fig. 9A) and revealed that the 2d(1/2,0,1/2) position is only partially occupied (∼27%), whereas the other two oxygen sites do not show any detectable deviations from the stoichiometry. The refined structural parameters are summarized in Table 2, and a schematic illustration of the structure is shown in Fig. 9C. The diffraction patterns were considerably affected by microstructural effects resulting in anisotropic peak broadening which has been successfully modelled by a spherical harmonics expansion of the crystallite shape.

The crystal structure is closely related to the structure of the Ni1+-containing strongly reduced La1.6Sr0.4(Ni1+0.66Ni2+0.34)O3.47 nickelate37 as well as to the orthorhombic structure of Sr2CuO3.38 The latter adopts the same Immm space group but the 2d Wyckoff position is fully vacant, resulting in a set of isolated chains of Cu ions in the square planar coordination. Other studied compositions of the Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ series with x = 1.2–1.4 and possibly with x = 1.0 exhibit similar oxygen vacancy ordering after reduction under inert atmosphere. It is remarkable that oxygen-deficient compositions of these series with smaller x, like for instance Nd1.8Sr0.2NiO4−δ, crystallize into a different oxygen vacancy-ordered structure with monoclinic C2/c symmetry.39 Another comment is that, although compositions with x &gt; 1.0 show high oxygen deficiency at elevated temperatures in air, they still preserve the tetragonal I4/mmm structure under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2). This indicates that structural transition is induced not only by the high concentration of oxygen vacancies, but also may be interrelated with the nickel oxidation state.
One should also note that the values of oxygen nonstoichiometry observed during the heating/cooling cycle in inert atmosphere (Fig. 7) are not in equilibrium. In contrast to oxidizing conditions, Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ samples demonstrated quite slow kinetics of equilibration in inert gas atmosphere even at 700–950 °C (see ESI, Fig. S2). While on cooling this can partly be explained by the low concentration of oxygen in the gas flow, and slow equilibration on heating implies that in fact this is associated with slow structural changes and that oxygen vacancy ordering is probably accompanied by ordering in the cation sublattice as well. The structural changes were found to be reversible: for all compositions, the tetragonal structure was restored after annealing in air at 1000 °C for 5–10 h.
3.4.Thermochemical expansion
All studied Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics exhibit rather unusual dilatometric behavior on thermal cycling under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 10). Initially, heating under air or oxygen atmospheres results in a linear elongation of ceramic samples. This is followed however by a noticeable deviation from the linearity above 500–650 °C for compositions with x ≥ 1.2 and even some shrinkage at 750–810 °C for ceramics with a higher strontium content under air atmosphere. The onset of deviations from a linear expansion shifts to a lower temperature and their extent becomes larger with increasing strontium content. All compositions, including NdSrNiO4−δ, show significant hysteresis in dimensional changes on temperature cycling, although initial dimensions are eventually restored after cooling.
Dilatometric curves of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics on thermal cycling in air (solid lines) and in O2 (dashed lines).
Reversible abrupt dimensional changes in oxide materials on temperature cycling often originate from the temperature-induced phase and structural transitions. For nickel-based oxides, relevant examples of such behavior include Er0.3Sr0.7NiO3−δ,40 Nd1−xEuxNiO3 41 and BiNiO3.42 However, as mentioned above, thermal analysis did not reveal any thermal events in DSC curves of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramic samples. Furthermore, no discontinuity is observed in temperature dependencies of the lattice parameters calculated from the HT-XRD data (Fig. 3). All this rules out a phase/structural transition as a cause of specific dilatometric behavior of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics. Other reasons such as slow lattice relaxation due to sluggish oxygen exchange with a gas phase or excessively fast heating/cooling also can be excluded. As discussed above, Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ exhibit very fast re-equilibration with a gas phase on temperature cycling. In addition, dilatometric studies with isothermal equilibration steps at 700–950 °C demonstrated that, even though ceramic samples show some minor dimensional relaxation during isothermal treatments, these changes are negligible, and the overall shape of dilatometric curves and thermal hysteresis are maintained (see ESI, Fig. S3).
It turns out, therefore, that the most likely cause of unusual dilatometric behavior of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics is strongly anisotropic behavior of the oxygen-deficient K2NiF4-type lattice in combination with microcracking. As shown in Fig. 3, Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ demonstrate anisotropic expansion of the lattice on heating with faster elongation along the c axis as compared to the basal plane dimensions. Although the unit cell volume increases linearly with temperature, anisotropic expansion of differently oriented individual grains in polycrystalline samples induces internal strains which cannot be accommodated by pores and promote the development of microcracks on cooling from the strain-free state at sintering temperature. Microcracking is known to be a cause of a large hysteresis in thermal expansion curves of ceramic materials with a crystallographic anisotropy;43,44 one typical example is aluminum titanate Al2TiO5.45 Heating above a certain temperature results in “healing” of microcracks and deviation from the linear behavior and even some contraction. On cooling, anisotropic strain mismatch is compensated by re-opening of microcracks which has an opposite effect on dilatometric curves. As microcrack healing and re-opening initiate at different temperatures on heating and cooling, this results in a hysteresis in dilatometric curves. Dilatometric data (Fig. 10) suggest that the microcracking-related processes in the studied nickelates occur mostly at ∼600–800 °C, although the initial dimensions of the samples are restored only after cooling down to room temperature due to slow microstructural relaxation. This phenomenon reasonably explains the unusual dilatometric behavior of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ samples as well as embrittlement of the ceramics sintered at higher temperatures (due to grain growth followed by a stronger microcracking on cooling).
Dimensional changes are closely interrelated with the oxygen nonstoichiometry variations. Increasing strontium content gives rise to larger oxygen nonstoichiometry changes (Fig. 5) and consequently higher anisotropicity of the lattice expansion on heating (Fig. 3). For Sr-rich compositions, temperature dependencies of the lattice constants deviate from a linear behavior, and these deviations have opposite trends for a and c parameters; eventually, a contraction in the a–b plane is observed at higher temperatures. As a result, increasing x results in larger dimensional changes in Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics at 700–900 °C. In contrast, increasing p(O2) reduces variations of δ with temperature and has a reverse effect on dimensional changes.
Note that, although lattice anisotropy and the accompanying microcracking phenomenon hinder the fabrication of dense ceramic samples, these factors can be expected to have a rather minor effect on thermomechanical stability of electrode layers due to smaller grain size and significant fraction of pores (≥40 vol%) which can accommodate the strains. Besides, studied Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics seem to possess moderate thermal expansion coefficients (TECs). Table 3 lists the average TEC values calculated from the dilatometric data (straight segments on heating) and from the high-temperature XRD data. These values are in good agreement with the data reported for other Nd2−xSrxNiO4±δ ceramics (x = 0–0.8,  = (11.6–14.4) × 106 K−1)3,6,8 and also are comparable with TECs of common solid electrolytes (such as stabilized zirconia, doped ceria or substituted lanthanum gallate) thus ensuring their thermomechanical compatibility.

Oxygen losses on thermal cycling at reduced p(O2) lead to a contraction of ceramic samples; the magnitude of these dimensional changes is strongly correlated with the range of oxygen nonstoichiometry variations increasing with x (Fig. 7).

Chemical-induced dimensional changes on reduction of oxide materials with variable-valence cations originate from two simultaneous competing processes: (i) formation of oxygen vacancy leading to lattice contraction due to electrostatic interactions, and (ii) simultaneous increase of cation radius causing lattice expansion due to steric effects.46 As the second process has a stronger impact, oxygen losses on temperature and p(O2) changes result in overall dilation of the crystal lattice in the case of perovskite and fluorite structures.47,48
The situation is different for anisotropic K2NiF4-type nickelates. Previous studies on oxygen-overstoichiometric Ln2NiO4+δ-based ceramic materials demonstrated that decreasing oxygen excess in these materials under isothermal conditions results in increasing a and decreasing c parameters; these changes compensate each other resulting in a nearly constant unit cell volume and negligible chemical expansion/contraction on redox cycling.8–10 It turns out that in oxygen-deficient Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ nickelates, within the tetragonal phase domain, lattice parameters vary in a different way: a decreases and c increases with increasing δ, though these changes still compensate each other as follows from a linear behavior of the unit cell volume (Fig. 3). This is in agreement with the available literature data on LaSrNiO4−δ.27
High oxygen losses under inert gas atmosphere result, as expected, in dilation of the Nd0.4Sr1.6NiO4−δ lattice along the c axis (see Tables 1 and 2). At the same time, ordering in the oxygen sublattice causes distortion of the structure and significant contraction along the bO axis. Although the size of the nickel cations should increase on reduction, it simultaneously decreases with the decreasing coordination number,48 resulting in a net contraction in the basal plane and shrinkage of the unit cell volume. A similar behavior is characteristic for other Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics diminishing when the strontium content decreases. Interestingly, the dilatometric curve of Nd0.4Sr1.6NiO4−δ on cooling in argon, when oxygen nonstoichiometry is almost constant (Fig. 7), did not show any anomalous behavior (Fig. 11) once again confirming that the unusual behavior of dilatometric curves under oxidizing conditions is correlated with significant oxygen losses.
3.5.Electrical conductivity
All Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ (x = 1.0–1.6) ceramics exhibit metallic-like electrical conductivity in the studied temperature range under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 12). Conductivity initially increases with the strontium content reaching the maximum for x = 1.2 and then decreases on further substitution. For Nd0.8Sr1.2NiO4−δ, the values of conductivity in air are as high as 286 and 510 S cm−1 at 900 °C and 600 °C, respectively. All studied materials show higher electrical conductivity if compared to parent Nd2NiO4+δ.
Temperature dependence of electrical conductivity of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics in air. Each data point was obtained after equilibration at given temperature for 4–20 h. Literature data3,4 on Nd2NiO4+δ are shown for comparison; the data points in air4 were extrapolated from the σ − log p(O2) dependences.
It is considered that metallic-like conduction in Ln2−xSrxNiO4±δ occurs via free electron–holes in the σx2−y2 band formed by delocalized dx2−y2 Ni orbitals, while dz2 electrons are localized.4,17,20,22,28 Increasing temperature decreases electronic transport in Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ due to the decline of both electron–hole concentration (Fig. 6) and their mobility.4 Variations of electrical conductivity in the Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ (x = 1.0–1.6) series correlates to some extent with the calculated electron–hole concentration (Fig. 6) but only at higher temperatures, above 800 °C, when the formal oxidation state on Ni is close to 3+ or less. It seems therefore that the compositional dependence of electrical conductivity in these series is an interplay between structural parameters, concentration of electron–holes, distribution of electrons between dx2−y2 and dz2 orbitals, and electron–hole mobility which also may be affected by oxygen nonstoichiometry due to scattering on oxygen vacancies. An additional factor is microstructural effects (porosity and microcracking).
Note that the data shown in Fig. 12 are “equilibrium” values, i.e. values obtained in a cooling regime after equilibration at each temperature for 4–20 h until the drift of conductivity with time became negligible. On temperature cycling, however, the conductivity curves demonstrate significant hysteresis at 600–1000 °C (Fig. 13). This apparent hysteresis originates from the dimensional changes accompanied by microcracking, as discussed above; both these factors have an effect on measured conductivity values. As for dilatometric curves (see ESI, Fig. S3B), this quasi-hysteresis cannot be eliminated by isothermal equilibration.

Oxygen partial pressure dependence of electrical conductivity of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics confirms that electronic transport is p-type and decreases on reducing p(O2) (Fig. 14) due to oxygen release from the lattice accompanied by elimination of electron–holes:4where K is the temperature-dependent equilibrium constant. In the studied p(O2) range, all compositions preserve metallic-like behavior with conductivity decreasing on heating (Fig. 14). Electron–hole conductivity is a function of both oxygen partial pressure and oxygen nonstoichiometry (which in turn also depends on p(O2)):5and therefore demonstrates strongly non-linear behavior in log σ − log p(O2) coordinates. Still, all compositions exhibit a comparatively high level of electronic transport under oxidizing conditions (&gt;10 S cm−1 at p(O2) &gt; 5 × 10−4 atm and T ≤ 900 °C even for x = 1.6) acceptable for oxygen electrode applications. Taking into account the data on oxygen nonstoichiometry (Fig. 5), one may expect that Sr-rich Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ are mixed conductors with non-negligible contribution of oxygen-ion transport to the total electrical conductivity, which is favorable for electrochemical activity.
