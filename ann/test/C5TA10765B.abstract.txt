It is important but still challenging to develop high-performance proton conducting materials for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), as such materials should meet the following requirements: stable proton-transport pathway over a wide temperature range, high conductivity at work temperature, and small activation energy Ea to maintain high conductivity at start temperature. Here, we firstly demonstrated that flexible metal–organic frameworks (FMOFs) are good hosts to seek out better proton carriers for such high-performance proton conducting materials. A FMOF [Zn3(tz)2(bdc)2]n (FJU-31, Htz = 1H-1,2,3-triazole, H2bdc = terephthalic acid) with high thermal stability up to 400 °C, which can be readily synthesized from the Zn5(tz)6(NO3)4 precursor and H2bdc, has been employed to host various organic hydroxyls as new proton carriers. Three resulting FMOFs Zn3(tz)2(bdc)2@G (FJU-31@G, G = hydroquinone (Hq), cyclohexanol (Ch) or butanol (Bu)) show large breathing effect amplitudes up to 65% and guest-related single-crystal to single-crystal structural transformations by temperature stimulus. Most importantly, FJU-31@Hq hosting hydroquinone with a high melting point and small pKa exhibits a high anhydrous proton conductivity of 2.65 × 10−4 S cm−1, low activation energy Ea of 0.18 eV, and the widest temperature range from −40 to 125 °C for stable proton conduction among the crystalline porous materials.
