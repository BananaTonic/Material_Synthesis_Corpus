Conclusions
We have successfully demonstrated the PFCA–CPE to be a promising electrolyte for LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 based 5 V lithium batteries. The resultant PFCA–CPE shows not only a higher ionic conductivity, but also superior thermal resistance and wider electrochemical window when compared with commercialized liquid electrolyte systems. Crucially, the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li cells using the PFCA–CPE deliver superior rate capability and excellent cycle performance at varied charge/discharge current densities. The more stable electrochemical properties of the PFCA–CPE endow the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 batteries with a better capacity retention than liquid electrolytes. At the same time, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/graphite full cells using the PFCA–CPE at a current density of 0.5C at 25 °C present a high discharge capacity of 118 mA h g−1 with an observed discharge plateau and a good capacity retention of 91.5% even after 100 cycles. Although much deeper insight work is still under way, we believe this work represents a significant step towards high-voltage lithium batteries.
