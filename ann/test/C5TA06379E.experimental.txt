The Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 sample was synthesized via a new sol–gel process. Stoichiometric amounts of LiNO3 (99%, Alfa Aesar), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (99%, Alfa Aesar), titanium(iv) isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich) and NH4H2PO4 (99%, Merck) were used. At first, titanium(iv) isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich) was added into deionized water immediately forming a precipitate of titanium hydroxide. The fresh precipitate was filtered, washed and dissolved in nitric acid (65%, Aldrich). After a clear TiO2+ nitrate solution had been formed, a twofold molar amount of citric acid monohydrate (99%, Merck) was added into the solution to stabilise it. LiNO3 and Al(NO3)3·9H2O were then added into the TiO2+ nitrate solution while stirring. After the salts were dissolved, NH4H2PO4 was added to the solution; this led to the formation of a sol. Stirring was maintained for another 0.5 h. After about 1 h, a stiff gel was spontaneously obtained. The gel was dried, calcined and milled in ethanol with zirconia balls on a milling bench. The ball-milled powder was put into a cylindrical pressing mold (10 mm in diameter, 4 mm in thickness) and pressed at a uniaxial pressure of 100 MPa. The pressed pellets were then sintered at 1123 K. Pure white samples with rhombohedral phase (Fig. 1) were obtained after sintering. The density of the pellets was over 95% of the theoretical density.
Immediately before the conductivity and impedance measurements, the pellet annealed at 1123 K was once again dried at 873 K for 16 hours to remove any moisture on its surface. Au electrodes of ca. 100 nm in thickness were applied using a sputter coater (Leica). The impedance measurements were carried out on a Novocontrol Concept 80 broadband dielectric spectrometer at frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 MHz. The temperature was varied from 123 K to 423 K using either a stream of heated nitrogen gas or a constant flow of cold nitrogen in the cryostat. Any contamination with water or carbon dioxide was avoided as best as possible.
In order to use the same pellet for further impedance investigations, the Au layer was sanded down and the surface polished afterwards. Then, the specimen was annealed at 1223 K for 16 hours again; the density remained almost the same. Subsequently, impedances measurements were carried out under the same conditions in order to test the impact of sintering conditions on conductivity properties.
For comparison, also a powder sample of Li1.5Al0.5Ti1.5(PO4)3 was investigated by impedance spectroscopy. A cylindrical pellet with a diameter of 5 mm and a thickness of ca. 1.2 mm was produced by pressing the pristine powder at a uniaxial pressure of approximately 0.5 GPa; the powder sample is a green body pellet with a density of reaching almost 90%. After the drying process (873 K for 16 hours, see above), Li ion blocking electrodes with a thickness of ca. 100 nm were again applied at each side by Au sputtering. For comparison, the powder was also used to prepare a pellet that was sintered at 1223 K for 16 h.
The pellet as well as the samples prepared from the LATP powder were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a VEGA3 (Tescan) before and after the sintering steps (see Fig. 2). X-ray powder diffraction (D8 Advance, Bruker) using Cu-Kα radiation was employed to check the phase purity of the samples prepared.
SEM images of the powder sample ((a), (b) and (f)) as well as the pellet investigated ((c)–(e), just differing by the magnification). Except the one shown in (a) all images were taken after the sintering step at 1223 K and the conductivity measurements. (b) and (f) refer to the same sample; the images differ in magnification.
