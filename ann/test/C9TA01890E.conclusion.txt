Conclusions
In conclusion, we report the preparation of anhydrous proton-conductive polymer membranes exhibiting high conductivity of higher than 100 mS cm−1, comparable to that of humidified Nafion. The preparation procedure adopted in this study includes the spontaneous and homogeneous infiltration of a strong acidic liquid into the cross-linked flexible basic polymer. Even if the membranes contain a large amount of H2SO4 (4 times the weight of the polymer), no spontaneous leaching out was observed. In addition, even if Tg is far below the ambient temperature due to the incorporation of a large amount of H2SO4, the membranes are self-standing because the polymers are cross-linked. When the molar ratio of the acid to the base group (nAcid/nBase) exceeds unity, the excess molar amount of H2SO4 acts as a plasticizer and the concentration of free protons increases, resulting in a drastic decrease in Tg and a remarkable increase in anhydrous conductivity. Moreover, by incorporating about 4 times the weight of H2SO4 in CL-P, the membrane, despite anhydrous conditions, exhibits the very high conductivity of more than 100 mS cm−1, comparable to humidified Nafion. Furthermore, by swelling an S–P–S triblock copolymer membrane with H2SO4, it exhibits not only anhydrous high conductivity, but also excellent robustness, especially to a large breaking elongation of 800% or more, since the hard domains serving as physical cross-links are located uniformly. In the future, we will investigate effects of humidity on the conductivity of membranes and the performance of assembled fuel cells under anhydrous conditions (see also Fig. S10 (ESI) of the preliminary result on performance of a fuel cell assembled with the anhydrous proton-conductive membranes under anhydrous conditions, though the performance was not good; this is probably because preparation and measurements of the assembled fuel cell have not been optimized yet. If catalyst layer preparation by infiltrating ion species is optimized, the much better fuel cell performance will be attained even under anhydrous conditions). Further development of higher-performance anhydrous proton-conductive polymer membranes based on a similar molecular design are desired to achieve practical applications of next generation fuel cells.
