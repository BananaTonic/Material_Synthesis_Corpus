2.Experimental section
2.1.Materials
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes fiber (B-type CNT fiber, here abbreviated as CF), GOx (Aspergillus niger (180 U mg−1)) were purchased from Taiyo Nissan and Amano Enzyme Inc., respectively. Tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr), tris-(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN, Mw ∼ 146), poly(ethylene imine) (PEI, Mw ∼ 800), gold(iii) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, ≥99.9%), and sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 99.99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2.Synthesis of TOA-Au NPs
TOABr-stabilized Au NPs were synthesized using a two-phase reaction reported as Brust method.39 Briefly, 30 mmol per L of gold(iii) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) in de-ionized water (30 mL) and 20 mmol per L of TOABr dispersed toluene (80 mL) were mixed with vigorous stirring at room temperature. Then, 0.4 mol L−1 aqueous solution of NaBH4 (25 mL) was added to the above mixture for reduction. After sufficient stirring (approximately 3 h), the aqueous solution was separated from the mixture, and then the remaining toluene solution was repeatedly washed with H2SO4 (0.1 mol L−1, 95% purity, Daejung Chemicals) and NaOH (0.1 mol L−1, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich). After the washing steps, the remaining aqueous solution was removed. As a result, we used toluene solution containing TOA-Au NPs for the deposition of TOA-Au NP. The diameter size of TOABr-Au NPs in toluene was measured to be approximately 8 nm.
2.3.Preparation of COOH-functionalized CFs
Pristine CFs with a diameter of 32 ± 0.5 μm and a length of 3 mm were first oxidized by in the mixture of nitric acid (HNO3, 25 wt%) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 75 wt%) at 70 °C for 90 min for the preparation of COOH-functionalized CFs (COOH-CF). The electrical conductivity of COOH-CFs was measured to be approximately 261 S cm−1. After surface modification, the COOH-CFs were dipped in the PEI polymer solution (1 mg mL−1) for 30 min for the deposition of TOABr-Au NPs.
2.4.Fabrication of n-Au-CF electrodes
The COOH-functionalized CF electrode was dipped in ethanol solution containing amine (NH2)-functionalized PEI (Mw ∼ 800; 1 mg mL−1) for 30 min to ensure the sufficient loading amount of Au NPs. It should be noted that the PEI with a large amount of amine (NH2) groups providing multiple binding sites as well as high affinity for TOABr-Au NPs on the surface of the COOH-functionalized CF, and furthermore PEI has stable hydrogen-bonding interaction with COOH-CFs.27 The PEI-coated COOH-CFs were then dipped in TOABr-Au NP solution (10 mg mL−1) for 30 min, and then TOABr-Au NPs-coated-CFs were washed with toluene solvent three times. In this case, bulky TOABr ligands bound to the surface of Au NPs were almost completely replaced by NH2 groups of the PEI-coated CF due to the high affinity between the bare surface of Au NPs and NH2 groups of PEI. After this adsorption process, TOABr-Au NP-coated CFs were immersed into the TREN ethanol solution (1 mg mL−1) for 30 min, and then washed with pure ethanol. Similarly, the bulky TOABr ligands were completely replaced by NH2-functionalized TREN molecules. These deposition processes were repeated until the desired bilayer number was obtained. The formed Au-CFs were used as a cathode as well as a conductive support for anode.
2.5.Fabrication of anodes for BFC
For BFC anode, the Au-CF electrode (i.e., (TOA-Au NP/TREN)20-coated CF electrode) was immersed into the enzyme (GOx) solution (5 mg mL−1) for 10 min that is dissolved in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and then washed with deionized water. After the adsorption of GOx, the GOx-coated CF electrode was dipped into the TREN-dissolved PBS buffer solution for 10 min again, and then washed with deionized water. Using these repeated processes, the formed (GOx/TREN)20/(TOABr-Au NP/TREN)20/CF was used as an anode for BFC.
2.6.Fabrication of a complete Au-CF BFC
The top end of 20-GOx/Au-CF anode and 20-Au-CF cathode were cemented to each copper wire using commercial silver paste (ELCOAT P-100 from CANS, South Korea) for the electrochemical measurements. The dried silver paste was further insulated with an epoxy adhesive (5 Minute Epoxy S-208 from DEVCON, USA). After the installation of the anode and the cathode in an electrochemical cell containing 50 mL PBS solution (20 mmol L−1 phosphate, 0.14 mol L−1 NaCl, pH: ∼7.4) at 37 °C, the BFC power densities were determined by two different methods; (1) the cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurement and (2) current flowing measurement through an external variable resistor (in the range of 1 kΩ to 10 MΩ) to control cell potential (see Fig. S1). Additionally, the toxic chemical issues of toluene, TOABr ligands, and PEI polymers should be considered in view of the biocompatibility of Au-CF electrode. The more detailed explanation is given in the ESI.
2.7.Measurements
FTIR analysis was carried out using a CARY 600 spectrometer (Agilent Technology) in the specular mode at room temperature, and the obtained dataset was plotted after line smoothing using spectra analyzing software (OMNIC, Nicolet). All spectra were obtained from 200 scans. The loading mass of the (TOABr-Au NP/TREN)n multilayers adsorbed onto the CF electrode was measured using an analytical balance (XP205 model, Mettler Toledo, resolution of 0.01 mg). For this investigation, we first measured the mass of the pristine CF electrode, and then measured the total mass of (TOABr-Au NP/TREN)n multilayer-coated CF electrode. Using this measurement, we estimated the mass of (TOABr-Au NP/TREN)n multilayers adsorbed onto the CF electrodes. The height of (GOx/TREN)20 multilayer on Au-coated silicon wafer was scanned using atomic force microscopy (AFM, XE-100, Park Systems) in non-contact mode. The film thickness was also measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE MG-1000, Nano-view Co.) at an incidence angle of 70.5° over five positions on the formed (GOx/TREN)m multilayer. Surface morphological images and cross-sectional images of Au-CF-based BFC electrodes were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S4700).
For the electrochemical measurements, the top end of an electrode was cemented to a copper wire using commercial silver paste (ELCOAT P-100 from CANS, South Korea). The Au-CF electrode (for cathode) and GOx/Au-CF electrode (for anode) were used as the working electrode, with Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt counter electrode, respectively. A three-electrode electrochemical cell coupled to electrochemical analyzers (an Ivium-n-Stat, Ivium Technologies) was used for cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of Au-CF-based BFC electrodes were measured in the potential range from −0.6 to +0.6 V in PBS buffer (20 mmol L−1 phosphate, 0.14 mol L−1 NaCl) of pH 7.4. Nyquist plots of the real and imaginary parts (Z′ and Z′′) of a hybrid complete BFC were obtained from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in a frequency range from 0.2 Hz to 100 kHz.
