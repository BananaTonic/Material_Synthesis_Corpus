2.1Preparation
ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O (99.99%) and Sc(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%) were dissolved in deionized water and ethanol (3 : 2, weight ratio). 8 wt% PVP (Mw = 1 300 000) was then added to the mixture to control the viscosity of solution. After complete dissolution of PVP, the mixed solution was injected into a stainless steel needle, which was connected with an anode. The applied voltage and the electrode distance for electrospinning were 20 kV and 20 cm, respectively. A piece of aluminum foil served as the cathode electrode to collect the nonwoven mat of the precursor nanofibers, which were subsequently calcined at temperatures from 550 °C to 1100 °C in air for 2 h to obtain ceramic 10ScSZ nanofibers. The as-spun nanofibers were also calcined at 800 °C in air, but the duration time was changed from 2 h to 100 h.
As a comparison, 10ScSZ nanopowders were prepared by the sol–gel method. ZrO(NO3)2·2H2O (99.99%), Sc(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%) and citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O, 99.99%) were dissolved in deionized water, followed by the addition of ethylene glycol (C2H6O2, AR). The molar ratio of citric acid, ethylene glycol and the total cation ions in the solution was 2 : 2 : 1. A viscous gel can be obtained by a vigorous stir at 80 °C which was then dried at 120 °C for 24 h and calcined at temperatures from 600 °C to 1100 °C in air for 2 h to obtain ceramic 10ScSZ nanopowders.
2.2Characterization
The morphologies and microstructures of 10ScSZ nanofibers and nanopowders were characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-7001F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and a high resolution TEM (HRTEM). To calculate the average diameter (D) of the nanofibers, the diameters of 100 nanofibers were determined from the SEM images using software Image J. X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-2500, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) was carried out to determine the phase structures and average crystallite sizes of 10ScSZ nanofibers and nanopowders.
The electrical conductivities of the nanofibers were measured by a two-probe method using an electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner, Kronach, Germany) from 450 °C to 650 °C in dry air over the frequency range of 8 MHz to 1 Hz. Conductivities of nanofibers at different oxygen partial pressures which were controlled by an oxygen partial pressure controller (SiOC-200C, STLab, Ibaraki, Japan) and at different humidities were characterized over the same range. For electrical characterization, the nanofibers were electrospun as uniaxially aligned arrays by introducing a gap to the collector,38i.e. using two parallelly aligned copper strips, and then transferred to a quartz substrate across two Pt electrodes (Fig. S1a). The collection time was ∼2 seconds for each run and was repeated for 20 times. Each sample for the electrical measurement contained about 400 to 500 fibers. The number (N) of the nanofibers was carefully counted under a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM, OLS4500, Olympus, Japan). As each fiber was well separated and can be distinguished from others easily under the microscope, the error in N was less than 2%. In the electrical measurements, the active area for each sample was considered as the total area of the cross-sections of nanofibers which is determined by the N × (πD2/4) product. The resistance (R) of the fiber sample was obtained by fitting the impedance spectra (Fig. S1b), and the electrical conductivity (σ) of 10ScSZ nanofibers can be calculated using eqn (1) (ref. 37)1where L is the distance between the two Pt electrodes. The experimental error of N and D for the fiber sample was about ±10 (i.e. ∼2%) and ±1 nm, respectively, and the relative error of electrical conductivity was estimated to be less than 5%.
