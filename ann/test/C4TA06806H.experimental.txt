Materials
Carbon nanofibers were supplied by Pyrograf Products, Inc., Cedarville, OH. This material is constituted by tubular fibers with an average diameter of 200 nm and a surface area of 20–30 m2 g−1. Aniline was distilled under vacuum before use. Ammonium persulfate (APS) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were used as received without further purification. Octa(aminophenyl) silsesquioxane (OASQ) was synthesized in our laboratory.
Preparation of CNF-SQ
As shown in Fig. 1, CNF–COOH was prepared using a Friedel–Crafts acylation method.31,32 100 mg of CNF–COOH were treated with a solution mixture of 50 mL SOCl2 and 5 mL DMF under reflux at 70 °C for 24 h to introduce acid chloride groups. Then, the residual thionylchloride was removed by reduced pressure distillation to yield acylchloride functionalized carbon nanofibers (CNF-COCl). Amidation of the CNF-COCl was carried out by dispersing 100 mg of CNF-COCl in 50 mL of anhydrous THF through sonication, followed by refluxing with OASQ (150 mg) and Et3N (1 mL) under a N2 atmosphere with stirring for 48 h. The solid precipitate obtained was filtered through 0.22 μm PTFE filter paper and washed with anhydrous THF to completely remove the residuals. After vacuum drying at 60 °C for 48 h, CNF-SQ was obtained.

Preparation of PANI-Grafted CNF-SQ (CNFS–PANI) and PANI blended CNF-SQ (CNF-SQ/PANI)
CNFS–PANI composites were synthesized by in situ polymerization of an aniline monomer in the presence of CNF-SQ. Initially, CNF-SQ was dispersed in 20 mL of 1 M HCl by ultrasonication for 10 min followed by the addition of the aniline monomer under stirring for 0.5 h at 0–5 °C. This solution mixture was then rapidly mixed with a precooled oxidant solution containing ammonium peroxydisulfate in 10 mL of 1 M HCl. The mixture was vigorously shaken for about 5 s and left undisturbed for 24 h. The obtained products were filtered after washing with HCl to eliminate any unreacted monomer. Subsequently, these materials were washed several times with water and methanol in sequence until the filtrate became colourless and finally the product was dried at 45 °C under vacuum for 24 h. For comparison, the weight ratios of aniline to CNF-SQ were 10 : 100, 30 : 100 and 50 : 100, which were symbolized as CNFS–PANI10, CNFS–PANI30, and CNFS–PANI50 composites, respectively. In order to explore the effect of covalent functionalization of CNF-SQ with PANI, CNF-SQ/PANI was also synthesized using solution mixing in ethanol.
Characterization
Infrared spectra (IR) were obtained by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Bruker Tensor27, Germany) using the KBr method. Raman spectra were collected on a STR500 series (Seki Technotron) with a 514 nm laser source. The UV/Vis spectra (UV-2501, Shimadzu Co., Japan) of samples were recorded in the range of 200–800 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in the temperature range from 40 to 800 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere at a rate of 10 °C min−1 on a NETZSCH TG 209 F3Tarsus Thermogravimetric analyzer. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was investigated on a Rigaku D/Max-1200 X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at a generator voltage of 40 kV and generator current of 20 mA. The scanned 2θ range was from 5° to 40° with a scanning rate of 0.1° min−1. The morphology of the composites was studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) on a Hitachi HJ-1000 instrument, and TEM (Philips CM12, Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Nitrogen adsorption isotherms were measured on an ASAP 2020 sorptometer at liquid nitrogen temperature. The samples were previously outgassed at 150 °C for 2 h. The specific surface-area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method and the pore size distribution was also calculated using the non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) model supplied by the adsorption equipment. NLDFT models have a better understanding of adsorption processes in well ordered systems compared to more traditional models and would improve the accuracy and reliability of calculated pore size distributions (PSDs) for micro- and mesoporous materials, considerably.49 The electrical conductivity was determined by the standard four-point probe method at ambient temperature (RTS-8, Four Probes Tech).
The electrochemical performance was determined using a CHI 660E (CH Instruments, USA) employing a standard three-electrode electrochemical cell that consisted of a composite loaded 304 stainless steel mesh as the working electrode, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and platinum wire as the counter electrode. CNFS–PANI films were cut to 1 × 1 cm papers and were pressed together with stainless steel mesh under a pressure of ∼6 MPa for 10 min without using conductive additives and binders. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted relative to an SCE reference electrode at different scan rates (10–100 mV s−1), and the potential window for cycling was confined between −0.2 and 0.8 V. The AC impedance of the CNFS–PANI electrodes was determined over the frequency range of 105 to 10−2 Hz with a signal amplitude of 5 mV against the open-circuit potential. Charge–discharge cycle tests were performed in the potential window range from 0 to 0.8 V at different constant current densities. Measurement of cycle-life stability was performed by charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1.
