4.Conclusion
In summary, we engineered the electromechanical properties of an ionic polymer metal nanocomposite actuator consisting of the miscible P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA polymer blend membrane with an enhanced proton conductivity and ionic exchange capacity in comparison to the PVDF/PVP/PSSA- and the Nafion-based ionic polymer membranes. The P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA blend membrane with a blending ratio of 30/15/55, among all blending ratios, produced the highest proton conductivity and ionic exchange capacity due to the strongest intermolecular interactions, as confirmed by the thermal, chemical, and structural analyses. Perfect miscible characteristics are attributed to the P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA 30/15/55 blend membrane arising from the strong intermolecular bonding between ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE), PVP, and PSSA via CO and OH groups as compared to the other immiscible P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA blend membranes, as well as the immiscible PVDF/PVP/PSSA blend membrane. Our P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA 30/15/55 blend membrane exhibits an increase in proton conductivity, Young's modulus, and water uptake by 5.9, 4.9, and 1.6 times, respectively, compared to the PVDF/PVP/PSSA 30/15/55 blend membrane. It also exhibits a higher proton conductivity, ionic capacity exchange, Young's modulus, and water uptake by 1.4, 3, 1.8, and 3.1 times, respectively, than those of the Nafion membrane. The ionic polymer membrane nanocomposite actuators based on the P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA blend membranes showed enhanced actuation displacements and actuation forces by up to 42 and 2 times in comparison to the PVDF/PVP/PSSA and Nafion IPMNCs, respectively, at a low operation voltage of 1 V under both AC and DC voltages. In hydrated conditions, the P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA ionic polymer membrane nanocomposites showed prolonged actuation displacements for 2200 cycles at 1 V. We believe that our ionic polymer membrane nanocomposites based on a cost-effective polymer blending method can realize the low voltage actuators, where human-friendly and stable actuators are in demand.
