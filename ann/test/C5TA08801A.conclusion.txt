4.Conclusions
The carbon embedment methodology called In Situ Reductive Embedment (ISRE) was proposed, tested, and validated to be an effective strategy to embed carbon NPs into TiO2-like metal oxide NFs. The new Pt catalyst support termed as carbon-embedded Nb-doped TiO2 NFs (CE-NFs) shows significantly higher electrical conductivity than that for the “carbon-free” Nb-doped TiO2 NFs (CF-NFs). More importantly, Pt catalysts on CE-NF support can reach activities close to that for the catalysts on conventional carbon black support but can possess much better durability. The experimental data also show that doping of the rutile phase of TiO2 with 10 at% Nb leads to better properties than with 25 at% Nb. This is due to better incorporation of Nb into the TiO2 lattice at lower concentration while a higher Nb concentration promotes the formation of separate Nb oxide phases. Future work will focus on the evaluation of the in-house prepared catalysts under real fuel cell conditions and propose an innovative strategy to prepare more electrochemically durable PEM fuel cells with optimized performances.
