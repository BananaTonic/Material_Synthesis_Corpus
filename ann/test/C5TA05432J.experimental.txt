Results and discussion
LSN
The experimental XRD results of LSN are shown in Fig. 2. All peaks of LSN are observed, and only very minor peaks due to Li2S are seen. Scale factor, lattice constants, profile parameters, isotropic temperature coefficients, site occupancy factors, atomic coordinates were refined step-by-step to obtain the best fit. Site occupancy factors and atomic coordinates for Li were not refined. Also, it should be noted that anisotropic temperature factors could not be refined due to the resolution of the lab XRD. The lattice constant of Li9S3N is 5.5253 Å, which is almost identical to that in ref. 6 (5.5151 Å). Atomic distances are also similar: d(Li–N) = 2.07211 Å (1×), d(Li–S) = 2.5175 Å (3×), d(Li–S) = 2.76263 Å (6×). These results are summarized in Table 1.

At a 10 mV s−1 scan rate, Fig. 3, lithium plating and striping is seen. At about 0.5 V a small reduction peak is observed, but then no further reaction is seen out to 5 V. The small peak at 0.5 V likely corresponds to the decomposition of Li3N. It has been shown that at a voltage of 0.45 V vs. Li, Li3N forms N2.19 However, with the loss of nitrogen, it is likely that Li2S forms a passivation layer, as was shown to occur in thio-phosphate materials in previous DFT studies.20 This passivation layer extends the anodic stability out to about 2 V before Li2S reduction occurs.21,22 Beyond 2 V in the CV scan, it is likely that a surface insulating layer of sulfur prevents further reaction.
CV performed with a 10 mV s−1 scan rate. Li plating and stripping occurs, a small reduction peak is evident at about 0.5 V, but no further reaction is seen out to 5 V.
The conductivity results measured with EIS are shown in Fig. 4. The room temperature conductivity was estimated to be 8.3 × 10−7 S cm−1, and the activation energy was 0.52 eV. We attempted to extract a second semicircle related to grain boundaries using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 4; however, no evidence of a grain boundary contribution was evident even at −10 °C. It is possible that the presence of Li2S lowers the measured impedance, but the amount (based on XRD results) is exceedingly low and the impedance results are likely dominated by LSN.

To understand the origin of the lithium ion conductivity and diffusivity in LSN, NEB and AIMD simulations were performed. The calculated migration barrier from NEB calculations for one Li vacancy and compensated by a uniform background charge is 0.5 eV (Fig. 5). For bulk type solid electrolytes this value is relatively high (compare to 0.21 eV for Li10GeP2S12, 0.2 eV for argyrodite-type sulfides, or 0.34 eV for Li7La3Zr2O12 (ref. 23–26)). In this system it is not possible to stabilize a cation vacancy in the tetrahedral site since it will move to the octahedral site upon geometry relaxation as confirmed in the DFT calculation. The vacancies are relatively stable in the octahedral site coordinated by 6 sulfur atoms (as compared to the tetrahedral vacancies). The lowest energy path for the vacancy to migrate to the neighboring octahedral site is through two neighboring tetrahedral sites, Fig. 5. In the low vacancy limit, a highly coordinated lithium migration is required involving three moving lithium ions with a migration barrier of 0.5 eV. This barrier is mainly due to the energy of the Li passing through the triangular face shared between the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, and partly from the S- and N-bonds between the two tetrahedral sites, Fig. S1. Another pathway exists through the octahedral site coordinated by 4 sulfur and 2 nitrogen atoms. This pathway only requires a two atom coordinated motion; however, the migration barrier in this path is about 0.8 eV, Fig. S2. AIMD calculations were performed on a structure with a single vacancy charge compensated with a positive charge background. The activation energy is calculated to be 0.55 eV (Fig. 4) and the room temperature conductivity is extrapolated as 2.4 × 10−6 S cm−1 (Table 2). This is in excellent agreement with the conductivity measured experimentally.

LSN is an attractive material for an anode barrier layer due to its stability against lithium metal; however, its conductivity is too low for use as an electrolyte in a bulk type solid state battery. We investigated the possibility of substituting the material to improve the conductivity.
Using first principles methods, we computed the energy of all possible non-transition metal substituents that create lithium vacancies including S-on-N substitution. The 20 lowest energy substituents are shown in Table 3. The most stable substituents are  and  on the sulfur sites. The energy for  substitution is only 115 meV per substituent, and is an attractive means for producing vacancies in the LSN material. The lowest energy cation substituents are divalent cations on the Li-site .  is the lowest with a substitution energy of 848 meV per substituent. In all of these structures the lowest energy lithium vacancies reside in the octahedral sites, close to the substituent. Ca and Zn prefer the tetrahedral site, with one nearest Li atom displaced away from the center of the neighboring tetrahedral site towards the octahedral site (Fig. S1). This displacement moves the Li along the migration pathway and places it in the triangular face between the tetrahedral and octahedral sites.

We created substituted structures with 1-, 2-, and 5-substituents in the 8 formula unit supercell by substituting with Cl and Ca, and charge compensating with lithium vacancies.
The AIMD results are shown in Fig. 6. The vacancies created by  have a modest effect on conductivity. The activation energy is reduced from 0.53 eV to 0.44 eV and room temperature conductivity improves an order of magnitude to 5.9 × 10−5 S cm−1 (Table 4). This value is considerably better than LiPON, and, considering the low substitution energy, may be an attractive means to improve conductivity.

The AIMD simulation results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that the activation energy decreases from 0.41 eV to 0.27 eV as Ca substitution is increased from 0.125 Ca per formula unit (pfu) to 0.625 Ca pfu. The latter of which would make Ca-substituted LSN a superionic conductor with a room temperature conductivity predicted to be nearly 10 mS cm−1, Table 4. The substitution energy for  is 0.848 eV atom−1, which is considerably higher than . This suggests that synthesis of the highly substituted compounds may be difficult and would tend to form LiCaN, Li3N, and Li2S, requiring a highly non-equilibrium synthesis method to obtain these materials.
We performed NEB calculations on the Li8.5Ca0.25S3N structure to understand the origin of the improved conductivity in this material. The low energy migration pathway follows the same 3-Li atom coordinated oct–tet–tet–oct pathway as LSN, but the movement occurs in sites adjacent to the Ca (Fig. S1). The migration barrier is 300 meV (Fig. 5). The presence of the Ca displaces the lithium along the migration pathway and thus the higher energy of the equilibrium site reduces the barrier to pass through the triangular face.
For further insight we examined the trajectories of the AIMD simulations, Fig. 7. In the non-substituted structure there is little movement of the Li atoms. For Ca substitution, the AIMD results, Fig. 6, show a large improvement (30×) in room temperature conductivity as the concentration of Ca changes from 0.125 to 0.25 pfu, whereas the improvement is much smaller between 0.25 and 0.625 Ca pfu (4×). The marked decrease in activation energy between the 0.125 and 0.25 Ca-pfu structures can be explained by examining the probability density. In Fig. 7, it is seen that the lithium away from the Ca substituents are relatively immobile with the highest probabilities in their ground state locations; however, in the vicinity of the Ca atoms, the situation changes. The probability density is nearly continuous in the oct–tet–tet–oct pathway around the Ca atoms. Furthermore, at Li8.5Ca0.25S3N a 3-dimensional conduction channel is formed from the connection of the migration pathway between adjacent Ca forming a percolation network. This explains the large improvement in conductivity seen when going from 0.125 to 0.25 Ca-pfu.
