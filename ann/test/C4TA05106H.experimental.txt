2.1.Materials
1-Vinylimidazole (VIm) (&gt;98%) was purchased from TCI Chemical. (2-Bromoethyl)trimethylammonium bromide (99%) and 1,2-dimethylimidazole (98%) were purchased from J&amp;K Chemical. 2,2′-Azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) was purchased from Aladdin, and AIBN was recrystallized from ethanol. 2-Bromoethyl ethyl ether (98%) was purchased from Energy Chemical. Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) was kindly provided by Morita Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. All other reagents, solvents and salts were used as received.
2.2.Synthesis of PVIm homopolymer
The PVIm was synthesized by radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole (VIm) in toluene, with AIBN as an initiator. The desired amount of VIm monomer was dissolved in toluene, and then the initiator (0.5 wt% with respect to monomer) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred under Ar at 65 °C for 8 h. The polymer was washed with acetone (5×), subsequently filtered, and finally dried in vacuum oven at 75 °C for 24 h.
2.3.Synthesis of bromide intermediate, poly[VIm][TMEN][Br]
Poly[VIm][TMEN][Br] was synthesized by refluxing the mixture of PVIm (1 equiv. with respect to the monomer unit) and (2-bromoethyl)trimethylammonium bromide (1.2 equiv.) in ethanol solution for 6 days at 75 °C. The product would be precipitated from the mixture at the end of the reaction. Then the bromide intermediate was washed with ethanol (3×) at 75 °C under refluxing to remove the unreacted (2-bromoethyl)trimethylammonium bromide. Finally, the as-obtained poly[VIm][TMEN][Br] was dried under high vacuum at 75 °C for 24 h.
2.4.Synthesis of dicationic imidazolium-tetraalkylammonium-based PIL, poly[VIm][TMEN][TFSI]
The bromide intermediate, poly[VIm][TMEN][Br] (1 equiv. with respect to the monomer unit) was dissolved in deionized water. LiTFSI (1.2 equiv.) was added and the reaction mixtures were stirred for 2 h; large amounts of white powder precipitated from the solution. After filtration, the white powder was washed with deionized water several times until the residual by-product (LiBr) could not be detected with the use of AgNO3 (0.1 M). The solid was dried under high vacuum at 90 °C for 36 h to yield the resulting poly[VIm][TMEN][TFSI].
2.5.Synthesis of an ionic liquid, 1,2-dimethyl-3-ethoxyethyl imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (IM(2o2)11TFSI)
IM(2o2)11TFSI was synthesized according to the previous report,31 and its chemical structure was confirmed by 1H NMR spectrum.
2.6.Preparation of gel polymer electrolyte based on PIL, poly[VIm][TMEN][TFSI] as polymer host
The gel polymer electrolytes with three different weight compositions (Table 1) were prepared by dissolving the as-prepared PIL (host), IM(2o2)11TFSI (ionic liquid) and LiTFSI (salt) in acetone. The mixtures were cast into PTFE slides to prepare the electrolyte membranes. Then the GPEs were dried under the protection of Ar atmosphere at room temperature for 16 h and then dried under vacuum at 90 °C for 36 h. Finally, the GPEs were moved into an argon-filled glove box (O2 &lt; 0.1 ppm, H2O &lt; 0.1 ppm) and dried for 48 h to remove the final traces of acetone. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the obtained PIL-based polymer electrolytes are self-standing and flexible.

The CR2016 coin-type cells were set up. The cathode was prepared by mixing LiFePO4, acetylene black and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) in a weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1. The active material loading was ca. 1.5–2.5 mg cm−2. Lithium metal foil (battery grade) was used as the anode. The coin-type battery test cells were assembled by laminating a LiFePO4 cathode, a dicationic PIL-based electrolyte membrane and a lithium foil in the argon-filled UNILAB glove box.
2.8.Measurements
The chemical structures of polymers obtained in this work were confirmed by 1H NMR (Avance III 400) technique. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic measurements were recorded on a Bruker IFS-28 FT-IR spectrometer. Elemental composition (C, N, S and H) was measured by an elemental analyzer (Elementar, Vario-ELIII IRMS).
The intrinsic viscosity ([η]) of poly[VIm][TMEN][TFSI] was measured by employing an Ubbelohde dilution viscometer at 25 °C in acetone. The value of the viscosity-average molecular weight (Mv) of poly[VIm][TMEN][TFSI] was calculated using the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada equation [η] = KMva, wherein K = 6.76 × 10−3 cm3 g−1 and a = 0.71, which were determined in a PMMA/acetone solution at 25 °C.32 The result showed that [η] = 113.9 cm3 g−1, and Mv = 1.13 × 106 g mol−1.
The calorimetric measurements were made with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, TA Instruments Q2000) in the temperature range −80 °C to 200 °C. The PIL and electrolyte samples (about 15 mg) were sealed in aluminum pan, then heated and cooled at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flow of nitrogen. The thermal data were collected during heating in the second heating scan. The thermal stabilities were measured with TGA (TA Instruments Q5000) in the temperature range 40–600 °C, under N2 atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
The ionic conductivity of the PIL-LiTFSI-IM(2o2)11TFSI electrolyte membrane was measured by impedance measurements using a CHI660B Electrochemical Workstation. The data were collected over the frequency range 0.1–100 kHz with amplitude 5 mV for an open circuit potential from 25 to 90 °C. The ionic conductivity (σ) of polymer electrolytes was calculated using the following equation:here, R is the bulk electrolyte ohmic resistance and S and L are the area and thickness of the polymer electrolyte film, respectively.
The electrochemical stability of as-prepared dicationic PIL-based electrolytes was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at 40 °C (scan rate 10 mV s−1) with a CHI660B Electrochemical Workstation. The cells used for this investigation were assembled by sandwiching dicationic PIL-based electrolyte between the stainless steel (SS) and the lithium metal, in which the stainless steel was employed as the working electrode and the lithium metal was employed as counter and reference electrodes. Separate tests were performed on each sample for the cathodic and anodic stability measurements by scanning the cell potential from open-circuit voltage to positive (anodic) or negative (cathodic) voltages.
Symmetric lithium metal coin cells (CR2016 stainless steel cell, 16 mm diameter disc of lithium metal and dicationic PIL-based electrolyte) were assembled in the glove box. After the cells had been kept at open circuit at 40 °C for 36 h, charge–discharge cycling was measured at the CT2001A cell test instrument (LAND Electronic Co., Ltd.) at 40 °C under two current densities, 0.05 mA cm−2 and 0.1 mA cm−2, for each polarization (16 min charge and 16 min discharge). Impedance spectroscopy of the symmetrical cell was undertaken on a CHI660B Electrochemical Workstation (0.1–100 kHz, amplitude voltage 5 mV) at 40 °C before and after cycling.
The cycling tests on Li/PIL-based electrolyte/LiFePO4 batteries were performed at low–medium temperatures (25 °C, 30 °C and 40 °C) using a CT2001A cell test instrument (LAND Electronic Co., Ltd.). The discharge current rates were varied from 0.1 C to 1 C, while the charge current rate was fixed at 0.1 C. Constant current charge–discharge cycles were tested between 2.5 and 4.0 V (vs. Li/Li+).
