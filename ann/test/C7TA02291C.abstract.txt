One-step radiation synthesis of gel polymer electrolytes with high ionic conductivity for lithium-ion batteriesElectronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c7ta02291c
We demonstrated a one-step synthesis method for a novel gel polymer electrolyte (named PDMP-Li GPE) based on 3-(dimethylamino) propyl methacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and 1 M LiPF6 liquid electrolyte solution by a γ-radiation technique for lithium-ion batteries. The resultant PDMP-Li GPE exhibited good thermal stability, excellent mechanical strength and high ionic conductivity, and the highest ionic conductivity reached 8.88 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C. The LiFePO4/PDMP-Li GPE/graphite pouch-type cell exhibited more than 97% columbic efficiency and the capacity retention was about 86% after 50 cycles at 0.1C. With these outstanding characteristics, it is expected to be a promising candidate for the application in polymer lithium-ion batteries.
