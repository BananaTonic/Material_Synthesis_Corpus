Experimental
Synthesis and surface modification
Tunnel-type Na0.44MnO2 powders were prepared using a solid-state method with stoichiometric amounts of Mn2O3 (Sigma Aldrich) and Na2CO3 (Sigma Aldrich). For the surface modification, an excess amount of sodium (1.5 mol%) was added to intentionally form surface residues such as NaOH and Na2CO3. These powder mixtures were calcined at 750 °C for 10 h in air. The obtained black products (5 g) were intimately blended with ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.05 g, 1.5 wt%]. The as-synthesized and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O melt-impregnated products were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD; Panalytical X'Pert diffractometer, Empyrean) between 10° and 45° (2θ) with a step size of 0.03°. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data was performed to determine the crystal structure. In addition, the as-received and melt-impregnated powders were examined using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; JEM-3010, JEOL) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS; 7200-H, HORIBA). Direct current (DC) electrical conductivity measurements were performed using the four-point probe direct volt-ampere method (CMT-SR1000, IT).
Electrochemical tests
The electrochemical properties were evaluated using CR2032-type coin cells. Electrodes were fabricated from the synthesized active materials (80 wt%), Ketjen black (10 wt%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 10 wt%) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The slurry was applied on aluminum foil and dried overnight at 110 °C in a vacuum oven. Discs were punched out of the dried electrodes (diameter: 14 φ, mass loading; ∼3.0 mg cm−2) to assemble coin cells with a thin sodium plate (Alfa Aesar Co.). For the electrolyte, 0.5 M NaPF6 in propylene carbonate (PC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (weight ratio of 98 : 2) was used. Glass fiber (GB-100R) was used as the separator. The fabricated cells using Na metal as the counter electrode were tested between 1.5 and 4.3 V by applying various currents (1C = 120 mA g−1) at 25 °C.
Post cycled electrodes
To identify the products formed on the surface of the active materials before and after cycling, the electrodes were examined using ToF-SIMS (PHI TRIFT V nanoTOF, ULVAC-PHI) with a liquid Bi+ ion source and pulsed electron flooding over a 500 μm × 500 μm area. XPS (PHI 5600, PerkinElmer, USA) measurements were performed on the surfaces of the bare and surface-modified Na0.44MnO2 electrodes in macro-mode (3 × 3 mm2) using a Mg Kα X-ray excitation source. A hermetically sealed transfer chamber (ULVAC) was used to transfer the electrodes from a glovebox to the XPS vacuum chamber to prevent surface contamination during sample handling.
