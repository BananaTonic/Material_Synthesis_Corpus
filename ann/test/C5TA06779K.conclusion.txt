4.Conclusions
(i) Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ (x = 1.0–1.6) ceramics with the K2NiF4-type tetragonal structure were prepared by the Pechini method and sintered at 1250 °C in an oxygen atmosphere. The tetragonal structure is preserved under oxidizing conditions on heating up to 1000 °C;
(ii) Acceptor-type substitution by strontium is compensated by electron–holes and oxygen vacancies; the role of the latter increases on heating. Oxygen deficiency at elevated temperature increases with strontium doping reaching ∼1/8 of the oxygen sublattice for x = 1.6 at 1000 °C in air;
(iii) Strong anisotropy of tetragonal lattice expansion on heating correlated with the oxygen nonstoichiometry variations results in an anomalous dilatometric behavior of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics. The results of dilatometric and high-temperature XRD studies show however moderate average thermal expansion coefficients comparable with those of common solid electrolytes;
(iv) Reduction of Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ in inert gas atmosphere induces oxygen vacancy ordering accompanied by a decrease of the lattice symmetry down to orthorhombic and contraction of ceramics;
(v) Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ ceramics possess p-type metallic-like electrical conductivity under oxidizing conditions, decreasing on reducing oxygen partial pressure. Highest conductivity is observed for x = 1.2 reaching 290–510 S cm−1 at 600–900 °C. The level of oxygen deficiency in Sr-rich Nd2−xSrxNiO4−δ implies that these materials are mixed conductors with non-negligible contribution of ionic transport to the total conductivity.
