Experimental
Preparation of GF
GF was prepared by CVD utilizing a mixture of CH4, Ar and H2 gases. After ultrasonic-cleaning using acetone, ethanol and washing with de-ionized water, polycrystalline Ni foil used as the catalyst was transferred into the quartz tube. The Ni foil was first annealed in an Ar/H2 atmosphere with different ratios at 1050 °C for 30 min to remove the oxides. After the annealing process, the direct growth of the GF was carried out in the CVD system using CH4 as the carbon source at 1050 °C for different time. The typical gas flow rate of Ar was ranged from 150 to 250 sccm controlled by a mass-flow controller. The flow rates of CH4 and H2 were controlled using two mass-flow controllers in each run, and the flow rates were maintained at 2.25 to 9 and 23 sccm, respectively. The optimization of the growth time is 3–9 h.
Preparation of GF electrode
The GFs were cut into disks in advance and used as current collectors in LIBs. An electrode slurry consisting of the active material of the LTO or LFP powder, conductive agent (acetylene black), and polyvinylidene fluoride binder with a weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 in a NMP solvent was drop-cast on the GF. For comparison, the anode or cathode slurry was also coated on Cu or Al foil. Finally, the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight to completely remove the solvent. The weight and mass loading of each cathode using the GF and Al as current collectors were ca. 4.0 mg and 2.6 mg cm−2, respectively. Meanwhile, the weight and mass loading of each anode using the GF and Cu as current collectors were about 4.5 mg and 2.9 mg cm−2. The half cells were assembled with Li metal as the counter electrode.
LIB investigation
The prepared electrode was punched into disks (diameter: 14 mm) for cell assembly prior to the test. Pure lithium metal (Aldrich) was used as the counter electrode and a solution of 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate (1 : 1 : 1 in volume) was used as the electrolyte. CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box where moisture and oxygen concentration were strictly limited below 0.1 ppm. The cells were then aged for 8 h before measurement. The galvanostatic discharge/charge test was carried out on the LAND CT2001A battery system at room temperature. Electrochemical impedance spectral measurements were carried out in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. For the half cells, the C rate here was calculated based on the theoretical capacity of the electrodes (175 mA h g−1 for LTO and 170 mA h g−1 for LFP). For the full cells, the C rate was used based on the theoretical capacity of LFP. The capacities of the LTO and LFP electrodes in the full cells were matched based on their theoretical capacities. Multiple cells were tested to ensure reproducibility.
Characterization
The morphology of the sample was determined with a scanning electron microscope (JSM-7001F) and FET TECNAI F30 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The EDS data were collected on a TecnaiG2 20ST (T20) at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. The Raman spectra were recorded using a RM 2000 Microscopic Confocal Raman Spectrometer (Renishaw PLC, England) with a 532 nm laser. The XRD patterns were obtained by using a Netherlands 1710 diffractometer with a Cu Kα irradiation source (λ = 1.54 Å). The XPS data were obtained with an ESCALab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W AlKα radiation. The base pressure was about 3 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.8 eV from adventitious carbon. TGA was performed on a NETZSCH STA 449C under atmospheric conditions at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Electrical transport measurement of the GF was carried out using a four-point probe test technique at room temperature. The average value of over five measurements was adopted at different positions on a same paper. A mechanical tensile test was conducted on a material testing system (SHIMADZU AGS-X).
