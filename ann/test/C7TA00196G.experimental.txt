2.1.Material synthesis
Polycrystalline LLTO powders were synthesized by the Pechini method using citric acid. The amounts of precursors, lithium nitrate (LiNO3, ≥99%, Aldrich), titanium(iv) isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4, 99.999%, Aldrich), and lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O, 99.99%, Aldrich), were calculated for x = 0.097 in Li3xLa(2/3)−x□(1/3)−2xTiO3 and dissolved in ethylene glycol (HOCH2CH2OH·9H2O, ≥98%, Aldrich) as the solvent. And then, citric acid (HOC(COOH)(CH2COOH)2, ≥99.5%, Aldrich) was added to the mixed solution while stirring. The resulting solution was heated to 270 °C to form a viscous gel followed by calcination at 900 °C for 3 h. To fabricate solid electrolytes, LLTOs were uniaxially pressed into disks at a pressure of 400 MPa, and then, they were heat-treated (sintered) in air at either 1200 °C or 1400 °C. To avoid undesired contamination from the crucibles, the samples were placed and sintered on a LLTO powder bed. The sintered electrolytes were polished to obtain flat surfaces and the desired thickness (∼1 mm).
2.2.Material characterizations
The crystal structures and phases of the LLTOs synthesized at different temperatures and Li contents were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical) equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) in the 2θ range of 10–90°. The morphologies and microstructures were examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM-7000F, JEOL) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM; ARM-200F, JEOL) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The chemical states of the elements were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a sigma probe (Thermo Scientific) after Ar ion sputtering. The chemical compositions of the as-prepared LLTOs were determined using an Aurora 60 (Bruker) inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). For the measurements of Li+ conductivity, both sides of the solid electrolyte were sputtered with Au (ion-blocking electrode). AC-impedance spectra were measured from 0.1 to 7 × 106 Hz with an ac signal of 5 mV amplitude using a Bio-Logic SP-240. The impedance measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from −20 to 70 °C.
