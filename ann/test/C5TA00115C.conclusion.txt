Conclusions
In summary, two new n-type LCs have been developed to study their structure/property correlations and to sort out how a minimal molecular structure change can be used to affect the macroscopic LC phase and ordering of these LCs for optimizing their charge-transporting properties. By extending one more carbon atom on the branching point of the side-chains, coplanar TI-BDFs with distinctly different LC phase order and molecular orientation on substrate could be obtained. The highly ordered LC, TI-BDF2, with 3-decylpentadecyl side-chains preferentially adapts an edge-on π-face orientation with high degree of liquid crystallinity under a broad temperature range, which leads to &gt;4 orders of magnitude higher electron mobility than that of TI-BDF1 (with 2-decyltetradecyl side-chains). This stable LC property endows room temperature solution-processed TI-BDF2 to have high mobility and conductivity after being doped by a thermally stable phosphonium salt. It showed a very respectable conductivity of 0.40 S cm−1 for solution processed n-doping systems.40 This study not only brings new insights on designing novel n-type semiconductors, but also demonstrates the potential of using solution-processible n-doped organics for wide range of organic electronic applications.
