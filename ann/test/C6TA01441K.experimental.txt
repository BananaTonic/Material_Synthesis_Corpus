2.1Preparation of Fe3+/PAA hydrogel electrolytes
The Fe3+/PAA hydrogels were synthesized by radical polymerization, and the ionic crosslinking mechanism between Fe3+ and PAA is shown in Fig. S1. First, FeCl3 was added to an acrylic acid (AA, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution under stirring. The molar ratio of FeCl3 was 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mol% of AA monomer, respectively. Then, potassium persulfate (KPS, Aladdin) (1.0 wt% of AA) was added to the above mixed solution and bubbled with argon gas to eliminate oxygen. After that, the above solution was injected into a mould of 120 × 120 × 1 mm3 and evacuated to remove bubbles. Finally, the reaction was maintained at 50 °C for 12 h to form Fe3+/PAA hydrogels. The as-prepared hydrogels were soaked in deionized water to remove the unreacted monomers and then dried in an oven at 50 °C. Then, the dried Fe3+/PAA was immersed in 1 M KCl aqueous solution to get KCl–Fe3+/PAA gel electrolytes with swelling ratios of 0.5–3. The KCl containing gel is denoted as KCl–Fe3+/PAA. The 1 M KCl aqueous solution is denoted as KCl-LIQ.
2.2Preparation of graphene foam supported polypyrrole (GF@PPy)
Graphite oxide (GO) was synthesized from natural graphite powder (Shanghai Yifan Graphite Co. Ltd.) by a modified Hummers method.42 The graphene foam was prepared by hydrothermal reduction of GO aqueous dispersion with pyrrole monomer. Briefly, 40 mL GO aqueous dispersion (4 mg mL−1) containing pyrrole (5 vol%) was pre-mixed and sealed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. After heating at 180 °C for 12 hours, the autoclave was cooled down to room temperature and graphene foam containing pyrrole monomer (abbreviated as GF@py) was obtained. For comparison, the pure GF electrodes were prepared through a similar procedure given above without the presence of pyrrole.
The GF@PPy electrodes were prepared by an electrodeposition method. Before electrodeposition, the obtained GF@py was cut into a 10 × 5 × 2 mm3 bulk. The electrodeposition was carried out in a three electrode system, the GF@py bulk of 10 × 5 × 2 mm3, a platinum sheet of 20 × 20 mm and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The solution mixture was made of 0.02 M KCl, 0.001 M HCl, and 0.05 M pyrrole. Prior to electrodeposition, the solution mixture was bubbled with argon gas for ten minutes so as to remove the oxygen. Finally, the electrodeposition was carried out at a constant potential of 0.7 V for 800, 1600, 2400, 3200, and 4000 s.
2.3Characterization
The morphologies of the samples were observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800). The samples of KCl–Fe3+/PAA gel for SEM observation were made by absorbing 500% water and then treated by a freeze-dry method. Digital photos were taken by using a Nikon COOLPIX S6300. The swelling ratio (SR) can be estimated using the following equation: SR (%) = (Wt − Wd) × 100/Wd, where Wd is the dry weight of membranes after being dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C, and Wt is the wet weight of membranes after immersing in 1 M KCl solution for a certain time. The mechanical properties of the KCl–Fe3+/PAA hydrogel electrolyte membranes were measured on a ZwickRoell testing system at a stretching speed of 100 mm min−1. The ionic conductivity of the KCl–Fe3+/PAA hydrogel electrolyte was obtained by the equation s = L/Rb × A, where L is the thickness (cm) of the hydrogel, A is the contact area (cm2) of the hydrogel with the current collectors, and Rb is the bulk resistance (Ω) obtained from the first intercept on the x-axis of the impedance figures. Rb was measured by sandwiching the hydrogel between two Pt sheets of 10 × 20 mm2 as current collectors on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. For the repeated stretching of the hydrogel electrolyte, it was tested on our self-constructed device as shown in Fig. S2, and the data were recorded after a 10 min stress relief period of the hydrogel electrolyte.
2.4Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation in a two electrode mode. And the cycling stability was measured on a program testing system (LAND CT2001A). The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor is calculated by using the two-electrode data following the equation Cs = IΔt/mΔV, where I is the discharge current, Δt is the discharging time and ΔV is the voltage change during the discharging time after IR drop, and m is the mass of active electrode materials (PPy and graphene foam) on the two electrodes.
