4.Conclusion
A new homopolymer is successfully prepared for application as a single ion conducting polymer electrolyte in lithium ion or lithium metal batteries. The polymer structure was tailored by introducing a functional C(CF3)2 group into the polymer backbone, thereby improving the solubility behavior such that an optimized synthesis affording a pure and solvent free product could be performed. Optimized gel-type blend polymer electrolyte membranes were produced by variation of the PVdF-HFP to single ion conducting polymer ratio, where higher fractions of SIPE significantly increased the achievable ionic conductivity and lithium ion diffusivity, despite the fact that the corresponding solvent uptake was reduced. A ratio of PVdF-HFP to the fluorinated single ion conducting polymer of 1 : 3 was found to be ideal, resulting in flexible membranes with a high ionic conductivity of 0.5 mS cm−1 at 20 °C, a corresponding transference number of 0.9 (that indeed reflects single-ion conducting behavior) and a 7Li self-diffusion coefficient of 4.6 × 10−11 m2 s−1 at 20 °C, respectively. Based on the obtained ion transport properties, a lithium ion dissociation degree of 30% was estimated. The long-term stability of the polymer electrolyte membrane against lithium metal and, in contrast to previous studies considering LFP as the cathode material, its applicability in NMC/lithium metal cells was demonstrated by cycling investigations, both performed at 20 °C as well as at 60 °C, highlighting the great potential of the introduced materials.
