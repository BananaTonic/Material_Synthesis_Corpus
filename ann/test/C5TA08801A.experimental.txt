2.1Synthesis of carbon-embedded and carbon-free Nb-doped TiO2 NFs
NbxTi(1−x)O2 (x = 0.1 and 0.25) NFs were prepared by electrospinning of a solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), titanium tetraisopropoxide and niobium ethoxide in ethanol.24,30 Exemplarily, a clear solution of 0.45 g of PVP copolymer (MW = 1 300 000) in 7.5 mL of anhydrous ethanol was combined with a solution of 1.6 mL of Ti(iv)-isopropoxide and 0.14 mL (10% doping level) or 0.44 mL (25% doping level) of niobium ethoxide in 6 mL of a 1 : 1 (v/v) mixture of acetic acid and anhydrous ethanol. The latter solution was stirred for one hour under Ar before combining with the polymer solution and the final solution was stirred for 3 hours at room temperature until homogeneous but viscous.
The combined solution was degassed by sonication for 10 minutes and filled into a plastic syringe for electrospinning. The syringe was equipped with a blunt 22-guage stainless steel needle and attached to an electrospinning apparatus.35 Good quality fibres were obtained at a distance of 12 cm between the tip of the needle and the collector, a voltage of 12 kV, and a flow rate of 0.35 mL h−1.
The as-spun NFs were left to dry on the aluminium collector plate at room temperature for 24 hours to obtain the atmosphere-dried NFs. They can then be used to fabricate either carbon-free (CF) NFs or carbon-embedded (CE) NFs as described below.
Carbon-free (CF) NFs were obtained by a conventional calcination procedure. The atmosphere-dried NFs were heated to 500 °C in a stream of air at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1, kept at 500 °C for 6 h, and then cooled down to room temperature. Finally, the oxidized NFs were loaded into a tube furnace for partial reduction by heating them to 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and leaving them at 800 °C for 2 hours in an atmosphere of pure hydrogen.
Carbon-embedded (CE) NFs were obtained when the initial calcination was performed in an atmosphere of pure hydrogen instead of air. So, the atmosphere-dried NFs were kept under hydrogen and went through the following consecutive processes: heated up to 500 °C (5 °C min−1), kept at 500 °C for 2 hours, heated to 800 °C (5 °C min−1), and kept at 800 °C for 6 hours. Hereafter this method to fabricate CE NFs is called In Situ Reductive Embedment (ISRE).
2.2Pt catalyst synthesis
The deposition of 20 wt% of Pt nanoparticles on different catalyst supports (either NFs or carbon black) was achieved by a microwave-assisted synthesis in polyols.27 Catalyst support (40 mg) was sonicated in 15 mL of ethylene glycol for about 2 h until it becomes well-dispersed; and the Pt precursor solution was prepared by adding 27 mg of chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) into 1 mL of a 1 : 1 (v/v) mixture of deionized water and ethylene glycol. The Pt precursor solution was added dropwise to the suspension of catalyst support in ethylene glycol and stirred for 1 h until uniform. Aqueous 0.1 M NaOH was added carefully until a pH of 10 was reached and the suspension was stirred for additional 2 h. This suspension was heated to 185 °C for 2 min in a Biotage® (Initiator Classic) microwave reactor, cooled to 50 °C and then reacted again in the microwave to ensure complete reduction of all Pt ions. Centrifugation (Sorvall™ by ThermoScientific) at 5000 rpm for 30 minutes was used to isolate the Pt coated catalyst support that was washed with deionized water until a neutral pH was reached and finally dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 12 hours.
In total five different catalyst materials were prepared and denoted: 20 wt% Pt/CF10, 20 wt% Pt/CE10, 20 wt% Pt/CF25, 20 wt% Pt/CE25, and 20 wt% Pt/Vulcan.
2.3Physical characterization
The micromorphology of synthesized NFs was examined by scanning electron microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 FEG equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer EDAX SiLi Detector) in secondary mode at 6 kV to conduct the surface studies of NFs. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer equipped with a Vantec-500 area detector and GADDS software package. The X-ray tube was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA (CuKα1 radiation with a wavelength of 1.54187 Å) and an initial beam diameter of 0.5 mm was chosen. The Van der Pauw method36 was used to measure the electronic conductivity of the samples. For conductivity measurements, the powder samples were made into pellets of 13 mm in diameter and about 3 mm in thickness using a stainless steel die in a hydraulic press at a pressure of 5000 pounds-force. To obtain reliable data, a liquid metal alloy (gallium–indium eutectic alloy, Sigma-Aldrich) was used at the interface between probes and pressed pellets. Multiple measurements have been made at different orientations and the average readings have been reported with a unit of S cm−1. The pore size and surface area analyser (NOVA 1200e, Quantachrome Instruments) equipped with NovaWin software package was used for surface area and average pore size measurement. The total amount of adsorbed nitrogen onto supports at relative pressures P/P0 (adsorptive pressure/saturated vapour pressure) between 0.01 and 0.3 has been used for BET surface area measurements, the measurements were performed at a constant temperature of 77 K (−196 °C). The t-method of de Boer,37 offered by NovaWin software,38,39 was used for the calculation of external surface area, i.e. the area of pores with diameters (D) larger than 2 nm. The slope and intercept of the obtained t-plots using NovaWin software correspond to the external surface area and micropore volume, respectively. Further, the pore size distributions were calculated from desorption branch of the isotherms using the Barrett, Joyner and Halenda (BJH) method.38 Raman spectroscopy measurements were conducted on an inVia Raman microscope (Renishaw) by using an argon laser with an excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm and an objective lens of ×50 magnification. Curve fittings for the determination of Raman spectra parameters were performed by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Spectra were fitted by using the Levenberg–Marquardt fit algorithm40 with r-square values close to 1.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a thermal analysis (TA) instrument (SDT Q600) in air with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 from room temperature to 1050 °C. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were taken at an image-corrected low-base microscope (FEI Titan), operated at 300 kV, equipped with an x-sight EDS detector using the INCA processing software (Oxford Instruments). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on an Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos analytical). Powder samples were pressed into indium foil using a clean glass slide before XPS measurements. Both survey scans and high resolution analyses were carried out with an analysis area of 300 × 700 microns and pass energies of 160 eV and 20 eV, respectively. The instrument work function was calibrated to provide a binding energy (BE) of 83.96 eV for the Au 4f7/2 line for metallic gold and the spectrometer dispersion was adjusted to provide a BE of 932.62 eV for the Cu 2p3/2 line of metallic copper. The Kratos charge neutralizer system was used on all specimens. Spectra were charge corrected so that the main line of the carbon 1s spectrum (adventitious carbon) was set to 284.8 eV.
2.4Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical characterization was conducted in a conventional three-electrode system contained in a glass cell using a rotating disk electrode (BASi RDE-2). Pt wire and saturated Ag/AgCl electrodes were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A 0.076 cm2 (D = 3 mm) area glassy carbon (GC) rotating disk electrode (RDE) with a tip coated with a thin layer of catalyst served as the working electrode. Before coating the catalyst onto a GC electrode, the catalyst ink was prepared by sonicating 3 mg of the desired catalyst in 1.5 mL of isopropanol for 20 min. While sonicating, 5 μL of the prepared catalyst ink was taken with a micropipette and dropwise added onto a pre-polished GC electrode. Consequently, the total catalyst loading on the GC electrode was 10 μg (2 μg of Pt). Evaporation of the solvent at room temperature yielded the catalyst layer that was impregnated by adding 2 μL of diluted Nafion ionomer solution (5 wt% in aliphatic alcohols, type: D-520 from DuPont) onto the catalyst layer to form a thin protective coating. The as-prepared working electrodes were dried in air at room temperature for 12 h before subjected to electrochemical tests.
The dried working electrodes were activated in the electrolyte by running cyclic voltammograms (CVs) until a steady CV was obtained. All CVs were performed in Ar saturated solutions of 0.5 M H2SO4 between 0 V and 1.2 V versus RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. To investigate the electrochemical durability of the catalysts, 1000 full potential cycles were performed in the range of 0 V to 1.2 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. To check the electrochemical durability of the catalysts, the electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) were calculated and compared after 0, 100, 500, and 1000 cycles. The ECSAs were calculated based on charge integrations of the hydrogen adsorption peaks between 0.05 and 0.38 V (RHE) in the negative going potential sweeps.41 A standard hydrogen monolayer desorption charge of 210 μC cm−2 on a pure Pt surface was assumed.41
For Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) mass activity measurements, linear sweep voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in O2 saturated solutions of 0.5 M H2SO4 with a rotation speed of 1600 rpm at room temperature and ambient pressure. To check the durability of catalysts, the ORR mass activities were reported and compared after 0 and 1000 potential cycles. The linear current–voltage curves at the negative sweep scan in the potential range of 0.4 V to 1.1 V were used for ORR measurements. The ORR mass activities, with a unit of mA mgPt−1, were estimated by calculating Ik (kinetic current) based on a mass transport correction for thin-film RDEs (eqn (1)) and normalization to the Pt-loading of the working electrode:411where I is the measured current at 0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), Ik is the kinetic current and Ilim is the measured diffusion limited current at 0.4 V. All potentials were reported versus to RHE using eqn (2) and all ORR polarization curves were corrected by subtracting the background current under the steady state and N2 atmosphere.2E(RHE) = E(Ag/AgCl) + 0.197 + 0.0592 × pH
Specific activities at 0.9 V, with a unit of A mPt−2, were all reported by dividing the corresponding mass activities (Ik) by ECSAs.42
