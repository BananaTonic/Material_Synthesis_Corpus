4.1Synthesis of 1
A solution of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (2.23 g, 5 mmol) and (CH3)2NH·HCl (1.02 g, 12.5 mmol) in water (30 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of H2C2O4·2H2O (1.26 g, 10 mmol) and (CH3)2NH·HCl (1.02 g, 12.5 mmol) in water (30 mL) under stirring at room temperature. After half an hour, the resultant precipitate was filtered, washed with water and dried in air to give 1 as a white solid, 2.14 g, yield: 96%. IR (cm−1): 3465 (s), 3108 (m), 2940 (w), 2821 (m), 1620 (vs), 1466 (m), 1437 (m), 1358 (m), 1317 (s), 1022 (m), 794 (s). Anal. calcd for C6H16EuNO12 (%): C, 16.15; H, 3.61; N, 3.14. Found: C, 16.32; H, 3.78; N 3.02.
1 is air-stable and insoluble in common solvents such as H2O, CH3OH, C2H5OH, CH3COCH3, CH3CN, and DMF.
