Preparation of (6-bromohexyl)trimethylammonium bromide (QA)
QA was synthesized according to the previous literature.43 In brief, 24.4 g (100 mmol) of 1,6-dibromohexane was added into 150 mL of THF in a 250 mL three-necked flask. Afterward, trimethylamine gas was bubbled into the above solution and the reaction was maintained at 25 °C for 4 h. Then, the reaction was maintained for another 24 h and a white precipitate was obtained. Finally, the precipitate was filtered and dried overnight under vacuum. The chemical structure of QA was characterized by 1H-NMR spectroscopy in D2O as shown in Fig. S1 (δ = 3.0 ppm (9H, s, CH3–N+–), δ = 3.2 ppm (2H, t, –CH2–N+–), δ = 3.4 ppm (2H, t, –CH2–Br), and δ = 1.3–1.8 ppm (8H, m, –CH2–)).
Preparation of 1-(6-bromohexyl)-1-methylpyrrolidinium bromide (Pyr)
The preparation of Pyr was conducted according to the literature.44 Pyr was synthesized by dripping 1-methylpyrrolidine (10 mmol, 1.04 mL in 20 mL of acetone) into a 100 mL acetone solution with an excess amount of 1,6-dibromohexane (100 mmol, 24.4 g) at 30 °C for 48 h. Finally, the white precipitate was filtered and dried overnight under vacuum. The chemical structure of Pyr was characterized by 1H-NMR as shown in Fig. S1 (δ = 1.38–1.48 (m, 2H), δ = 1.48–1.58 (m, 2H), δ = 1.79–1.95 (m, 4H), δ = 2.23 (s, 4H), δ = 3.06 (s, 3H), δ = 3.32–3.40 (m, 2H), and δ = 3.45–3.59 (m, 6H)).
Preparation of 1-(6-bromohexyl)-1-methylpiperdinium bromide (Pip)
Pip was prepared using a similar procedure to that for Pyr from 1-methylpiperidine (10 mmol, 1.21 mL) and 1,6-dibromohexane (100 mmol, 24.4 g). The white precipitate was characterized by 1H-NMR (Fig. S1,δ = 1.30–1.46 (m, 2H), δ = 1.41–1.47 (m, 2H), δ = 1.54–1.62 (m, 2H), δ = 1.67–1.74 (m, 2H), δ = 1.78–1.84 (m, 6H), δ = 2.95 (s, 3H), δ = 3.21–3.30 (m, 6H), and δ = 3.44–3.46 (t, 2H)).
Synthesis of poly(isatin biphenylene)
Poly(isatin biphenylene) (PIB) was synthesized by superacid-catalyzed step-growth polymerization. Briefly, isatin (0.16 g, 1.1 mmol), biphenyl (0.15 g, 1 mmol) and TFA (0.8 mL) were stirred in ice-cold water for 0.5 h. Subsequently, 0.9 mL of TFSA was added into the solution mixture and kept stirring at 20 °C for 9 h to afford a highly viscous dark-green solution. Then, it was poured into water and the filtered polymer was redissolved in NMP. Afterward, it was poured into water and the white fibrous polymer was formed at the bottom of the beaker. The polymer was dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. The inherent viscosity of the polymer was obtained as ηinh = 0.62 dL g−1 in dimethylacetamide at 25 °C.
Synthesis of long alkyl side chain quaternary ammonium functionalized PIB (QAPIB)
PIB (1 g, 3.5 mmol) was fully dissolved in DMSO (20 mL) at 60 °C. Then, QA (3.2 g, 10.5 mmol) and K2CO3 (0.96 g, 7 mmol) were added into the above solution. Afterward, the mixture was kept stirring for 48 h at 60 °C and then poured into a large amount of acetone to obtain the product. The precipitate was washed with water and dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 80 °C.
Synthesis of long alkyl side chain pyrrolidinium functionalized PIB (PyrPIB) and piperidinium functionalized PIB (PipPIB)
Similarly, PyrPIB and PipPIB were prepared using the same method. PIB (1 g, 3.5 mmol) was dissolved in DMSO which contained Pyr (3.45 g, 10.5 mmol) or Pip (3.6 g, 10.5 mmol) and K2CO3 (0.96 g, 7 mmol). Then, the final products were obtained after drying overnight under vacuum at 80 °C.
Membrane preparation
QAPIB, PyrPIB and PipPIB were dissolved in DMSO to form a 5 wt% solution, respectively. Then, the solution was cast onto a clean Petri dish and the solvent was removed at 60 °C for 24 h. Finally, the obtained membranes were immersed in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution for 24 h to get the hydroxide form membranes. Subsequently, the membranes were completely washed with water and soaked in water for 24 h to remove residual NaOH.
Characterization and measurements
The structural characterization of QA, Pyr, Pip, PIB, QAPIB, PyrPIB and PipPIB was performed using spectral methods. 1H-NMR was used to characterize the chemical composition and the spectra were recorded using a Bruker instrument at 500 MHz with DMSO-d6 or D2O as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The chemical structure was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra which were recorded on a Nexus Euro spectrometer at 4 cm−1 in 32 scans and in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The morphology of the membranes was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM measurement was performed on a Bruker AFM instrument using a silicon-based n-type cantilever in the tapping mode. The TEM investigation was conducted on a JEOL JEM-2000EX with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. Before measurement, the samples were immersed in a 1 M aqueous Na2WO4 solution at 30 °C for 48 h, followed by washing with deionized water and vacuum drying overnight. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were performed on a NanoSTAR-U (BRUKER AXS Inc.) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Dry membranes in Br− form (thickness of 100 μm) were employed to investigate the ionic clustering. The effective scattering vector q (q = 4π sin θ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle) at this distance ranges from 0.07 to 2.0 nm−1. The thermal properties of the membranes were monitored by Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) which was carried out on a Netzsch 209C under a N2 atmosphere. The samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h before testing and heated from 25 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 during testing. The mechanical properties were investigated by testing the tensile strength using an Instron Model 1122 with a tensile rate of 10 mm min−1 at 60% relative humidity (RH).
The ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the membranes is measured by the back-titration method. The membranes in Br− form were soaked in a 1 M NaCl aqueous solution for 24 h, and then the membranes in Cl− form were immersed in 25 mL of 1 M NaNO3. The solution was titrated with a 0.01 M AgNO3 aqueous solution using K2CO4 as the indicator. The IEC was calculated as follows:1IEC = (0.01 × VAgNO3)/mdrywhere mdry (g) is the mass of the dry membranes and VAgNO3 represents the consumption volume of AgNO3.
Water uptake (WU) is an important tool to judge the properties of the AEMs. The membranes in OH− form were used to calculate the WU. These membranes were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C until a constant weight (W0) was obtained. The membranes were immersed in deionized water at 30 or 80 °C for 24 h, and then the water on the membranes' surfaces were quickly wiped and the membranes were weighed (W1). Finally, the WU of the membranes was calculated from:2
The swelling ratio (SR) has a close relationship with the mechanical properties. The length of dry membranes was defined as L0. The length of membranes which were immersed in deionized water at 30 or 80 °C for 24 h was defined as L1. Therefore, the SR was calculated as:3
The hydration number (λ) which represents the number of absorbed H2O molecules per quaternary ammonium group was calculated using the equation:4λ = (WU × 1000)/(MH2O × IEC)
The hydroxide conductivity of the AEMs is usually used to characterize the properties of membranes and is related to the performance of fuel cells. The membranes in Br− form were soaked in 1 M NaOH for 24 h. Then, the membranes in OH− form were carefully washed with water several times. The OH− conductivity was recorded on a CHI 660C (Shanghai, China) at predetermined temperatures in the fully hydrated state. Ion conducting resistances (R(Ω)) were obtained using the two electrode AC impedance method which utilizes two platinum electrodes. The R was calculated from the impedance plots obtained in the frequency range from 1 to 105 Hz. Therefore, the OH− conductivity (σ) was calculated from the equation:5σ = l/ARwhere A (cm2) represents the cross-sectional area of the membranes and l (cm) is the distance between the two platinum electrodes.
Chemical stability is an important parameter to evaluate the properties of AEMs. In this study, alkaline stability and oxidation stability were employed to characterize the chemical stability of the AEMs. The alkaline stability test of the AEMs was performed in a 2 M NaOH aqueous solution at 80 °C for 1050 h where the NaOH aqueous solution was replaced with fresh solution every 24 h. The hydroxide conductivity was used to characterize the alkaline stability and the data were collected in water at 30 °C. Apart from this, 1H-NMR spectroscopy and FT-IR spectroscopy were used to study the change in the chemical structure of QAPIB, PyrPIB and PipPIB after immersing in NaOH. Prior to the measurement, the membranes were washed with water to remove residual NaOH. The oxidation stability test of the AEMs was performed in Fenton's reagent (3 wt% H2O2 + 4 ppm Fe2SO4). The weight of the membranes in OH− form was employed to evaluate the oxidation stability of AEMs. The membranes were immersed in 100 mL Fenton's reagent at 80 °C. Furthermore, 1H-NMR spectroscopy and FTIR spectroscopy were applied to study the chemical structure of AEMs and TGA was used to characterize the thermal properties of AEMs after the oxidation stability test. Prior to the test, the membranes were washed with water to remove Fenton's reagent.
Preparation of the catalyst coated membrane (CCM) and fuel cell testing
The fabrication of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and fuel cell tests are consistent with the literature.45 Briefly, Pt/C catalyst (60 wt% of metal, Johnson Matthey) powder was dispersed in the ionomers, which were composed of quaternary ammonium poly(N-methylpiperidine-co-p-terphenyl) (QAPPT).23,46 The QAPIB membrane (68 ± 5 μm thick) and PipPIB membrane (36 ± 8 μm thick) were used to fabricate the CCM. Ink was sprayed onto both sides of the membranes and the catalyst loading for Pt/C in the anode or cathode was kept at 0.4 mgPt cm−2. Subsequently, the CCM was immersed in a 1.0 M aq. KOH solution for 28 h and then the CCM with OH− anions was washed thoroughly with deionized water. The area of the CCM was 4 cm2. Finally, the MEA was prepared by pressing the CCM between two pieces of carbon paper (AvCarb GDS3250).
The fuel cell tests were conducted on an 850e Multi Range Fuel Cell Test System (Scribner Associates Inc.) in galvanic mode using fully humidified H2 and O2 gases. Fuel cells were operated at temperatures of 60 °C and 80 °C, and the flow rate of both H2 and O2 gases was 500 mL min−1.
