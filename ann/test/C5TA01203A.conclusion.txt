4.Conclusions
APS was applied to the preparation of LSGM electrolytes for IT-SOFCs. Ga evaporation during plasma spraying was observed. The results showed the dominant effects of powder size and spray distance on Ga evaporation. Ga evaporation mainly occurred when the powder particle size was less than 30 μm, and the spray distance was less than 70 mm. Ga evaporation led to the formation of Ga-deficient splats and the LaSrGaO4 phase, dramatically reducing the ionic conductivity of the LSGM deposit. It was also found that the interlamellar bonding ratio (or interfacial connectivity) can be well controlled by depositing LSGM at a deposition temperature of about 300 °C. The simulation and experimental results revealed that the remarkable Ga evaporation can be well explained by a model involving vortex convection of the melt within the fully molten droplets. This model has provided guidance in the optimization of APS conditions for the deposition of dense LSGM electrolyte membranes from a powder with a particle size &gt;30 μm. The improved LSGM electrolyte membranes have a pure phase, good interface connectivity (&gt;80%), and low porosity (or high density), demonstrating an ionic conductivity of ∼0.075 S cm−1 at 800 °C, which is more than 78% of the bulk conductivity and ∼17 times that for the unoptimized LSGM deposit. Test cells assembled with the improved LSGM electrolyte membranes showed a peak power density of 712 mW cm−2 at 800 °C, suggesting that atmospheric plasma spraying is a promising approach to the cost-effective fabrication of IT-SOFCs.
