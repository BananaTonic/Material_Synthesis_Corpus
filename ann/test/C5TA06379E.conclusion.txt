4Conclusions
Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 belongs to the group of solid electrolytes which are expected to largely influence the development of all-solid-state batteries. A sufficiently high ion conductivity, being in the same order of magnitude as that of a liquid electrolyte, is one of the basic requirements needed. So far, the separate study of bulk and grain boundary conductivity has only rarely been documented. Here, we took advantage of low temperature conductivity measurements and impedance spectroscopy to study bulk ion dynamics at temperatures lower than 215 K. In this temperature range Li ion transport through the lattice is governed by an average activation Ea,σ of only 0.26 eV when a pellet sample is considered that was annealed at 950 °C. The grain boundary response is determined by notably larger activation energies ranging from 0.33 eV to 0.37 eV; the exact value depends on the sintering temperature applied.
We could further show that even bulk ionic conductivity seems to depend on the sintering conditions. Exposing the samples to ambient air for a long period of time slows down ion transport. The effect is reversible: after annealing the same pellet at elevated temperature, the original high ion conductivity is observed again. We attribute this finding to the influence of moisture on Li ion dynamics.
When compared with results from NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations presented in the literature so far, we have to keep in mind that DC conductivity measurements probe long-range ion transport while NMR is sensitive to the local barriers between next neighbouring Li ions. Moreover, whereas Ea,σ represents an average over the whole potential landscape, Li NMR is able to characterise individual diffusion processes whose superposition results in overall ion transport measured by conductivity spectroscopy in the so-called low-frequency range, i.e., the DC limit.
