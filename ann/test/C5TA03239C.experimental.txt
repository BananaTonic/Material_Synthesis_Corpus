2.1Synthesis
Stable sols are obtained by dissolving stoichiometric amounts of LiNO3 (99.99%, Merck), La(NO3)3·(H2O)6 (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), and zirconium(iv) 2,4-pentanedionate (Alfa Aesar) in a water and ethanol mixture. Importantly, water and ethanol dissolve nitrate and pentanedionate compounds, respectively. After the salts are completely dissolved, a gel powder is obtained by evaporating the solvent at 90 °C. Firing of the gel-powder at ∼600–650 °C for 1 to 10 hours in alumina crucibles with lids placed in a muffle furnace yields the tetragonal phase t-Li7La3Zr2O12. The tetragonal phase, t-Li7La3Zr2O12, can be obtained at a temperature as low as 600 °C and for an annealing time of 1 hour, but to ensure a high purity phase, a heating profile at 650 °C for 10–15 hours is usually applied. To obtain the cubic phase of Li7La3Zr2O12, stoichiometric amounts of Ga2O3 and t-Li7La3Zr2O12 that would give a composition of Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 are thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar. Annealing the Ga2O3 + t-Li7La3Zr2O12 mixture at ∼600–650 °C, either in the powder form or as pressed pellets covered with the parent powder for 10 hours, yields the cubic phase c-Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 with small nanoparticle sizes of ∼200–300 nm. The synthesis procedure is also summarized in Fig. 1a.

Throughout the study, all sample powders are kept under an inert atmosphere (e.g. Ar) after the synthesis to minimize the exposure to humidity. Though no major Li-loss is expected due to the low annealing temperature, still the Li-precursor (LiNO3) is taken in a slightly excess amount of 1–2 mol% for the synthesis.
2.2Characterization
A STOE Stadi P diffractometer equipped with a germanium monochromator and CuKα1 radiation (operated at 35 mA, 35 kV) was used to acquire powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples. Dilatometry curves were recorded with a TA Instruments DIL 806 optical dilatometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the samples was carried out with a Zeiss Gemini 1530 operated at 5 kV. For (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) analysis the material was deposited on a carbon foil supported on a Cu grid. TEM was performed on a Tecnai F30 microscope (FEI; field emission gun) operated at 300 kV (point resolution ∼ 2 Å), STEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) on a Hitachi HD 2700 CS microscope equipped with an EDX spectrometer (EDAX). Raman spectroscopy was carried out with a confocal WITec CRM200 Raman microscope instrument (WITec, Germany) equipped with a 532 nm wavelength laser for excitation, and the spectral resolution was 0.7 cm−1.
2.3Electrochemical tests
For AC electrochemical impedance studies, c-Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 pellets were processed from Ga2O3 + t-Li7La3Zr2O12 mixtures and symmetric electrodes were applied. Stoichiometric amounts of Ga2O3 and freshly synthesized t-Li7La3Zr2O12 were thoroughly mixed in an agate mortar and pressed into pellets with a uniaxial press at 35 kN. The pellets obtained this way were further processed in an isostatic press at a pressure of 1000 kN and sintered at 950 °C for 6 hours covered with the parent powder to avoid Li-losses and Al contamination from the alumina crucibles. The resulting pellets usually have a thickness of roughly 1 mm and a diameter of ∼9–10 mm, respectively.
Pt was sputtered on both sides of the pellets (BAL-TEC, SCD 050 Sputter-Coater) and Pt wires were sandwiched between two layers of Pt paste (Heraeus C 3605 S) using ceramic binders (Roth, Thermokitt (A) &amp; (B)) to ensure best contacts, see Fig. 5a. Pellet drying after the application of pastes and binders was done under vacuum to protect the pellets from humidity.
Electrochemical impedance spectra were measured with a Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat/galvanostat/ZRA within a range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The spectra were characterized using the ZView software.39 Cable and wiring resistances in the measurement system were approximated to 3 Ω based on a constant value for high temperature measurements. High temperature measurements (&gt;100 °C) were performed under dry synthetic air to avoid humidity exposure. For this, symmetric Pt–LLZO–Pt (electrode–electrolyte–electrode structures) were introduced in an own-constructed atmospheric-closed tube furnace (20–1100 °C) equipped with electrical and gas flow connections and a sample test platform for which temperature values and gradients were recorded exactly next to the sample by K-type thermocouples.
