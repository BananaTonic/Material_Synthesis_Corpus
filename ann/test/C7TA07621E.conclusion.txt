Conclusion
The full and congruent crystallization from glass process enables access to new ceramic compositions, as demonstrated for non-stoichiometric Ln1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ (Ln = Eu, Gd and Tb; with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.6) compositions. These new ceramics can be elaborated as a single phase (only the x = 0.4 terbium composition shows a small content of secondary phase which is related to a nominal composition overtaking the maximum Tb/Sr substitution level allowed for Tb1+xSr1−xGa3O7+x/2) and no remaining glass or amorphous areas could be observed. These materials present a quasi-perfect match between the density of the parent glass and the crystalline phase, which enables the synthesis of fully dense ceramics without porosity or cracks due to crystallization. Remarkably, the full density of the materials leads to ceramics showing transparency both in the visible and near infrared regions.
In situ high temperature XRD and TEM studies present neither structural nor microstructural modifications up to 800 °C. A combined synchrotron and neutron powder diffraction was used to localize the extra oxygen induced by the Sr2+ for Ln3+ substitution. This new crystallographic site is located within the GaO4 tetrahedral layer and matches the position previously determined for the La1+xSr1−xGa3O7+x/2 compositions synthesized by a solid state reaction.
The ionic conductivity properties of the transparent Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27, Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3 and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 ceramics, corresponding to the maximum possible substitution levels, were then evaluated. The Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3 material presents a remarkable 0.02 S cm−1 bulk conductivity from 500 °C. It appears that crystallization from glass leads to thin but highly resistive grain boundaries, which tends to decrease the total ionic conductivity.
The ceramic microstructure remains fully dense and transparent after thermal and conductivity cycling, despite the formation of crystalline Tb3Ga5O12 garnet nanoparticles at the grain boundaries. Full crystallization from glass thus appears as a promising technological process to produce new single phase and fully dense ceramics. Therefore, this cost-effective synthesis process could further (i) enable the synthesis of new ionic conductors showing optical transparency and thus drive the development of new applications such as oxygen sensors and pumps allowing visualization inside devices or photochemically assisted high-temperature water splitting34 and (ii) lead to new thin electrolytes with high performances: as a glass deposition process is much easier to perform than for ceramics, the electrolyte thickness could be dramatically decreased, leading to a significant increase of the conductivity properties.
