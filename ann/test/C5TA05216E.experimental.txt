Experimental
i-SMSC fabrication
For the i-SMSC, a thin film of ZnO was prepared similar to the previously reported procedures,18 in which ZnO precursor solution was spin-cast at 5000 rpm on top of a cleaned ITO, and then sintered at 180 °C for 1 h in air, resulting in a transparent ZnO thin film with a thickness about 40 nm. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (C4H6O4Zn·2(H2O) 99.5% from Merck, 1 g) and monoethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 98% from Acros, 0.252 g) in 2-methoxyethanol (10 ml) under stirring for 8 h for the hydrolysis reaction and aging. But the HOCH2CH2NH2 weight ratio is different from previously reported procedures (0.28 g).18 And the ZnO–C60 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (995 mg), PCBE-OH (5 mg) and monoethanoamine in 2-methoxyethanol (10 ml) under stirring for 8 h for the hydrolysis reaction and aging. Then, the ZnO or ZnO–C60 film on ITO is soaked in 0.1 mM fullerene derivative solution (NPC70-OH and NPC60-OH) in CB/THF (1 : 1, by v/v) for 10 min at room temperature and then washed with a clean solvent (the same solvent as in the corresponding solution). On top of the modified ZnO–C60 (ZnO) or pristine ZnO–C60 (ZnO) film, a thin layer (about 100 nm) of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 : PC71BM(3 : 2, w/w) was spin-cast in a N2-filled glovebox from its solution in chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodooctane (99.6 : 0.4, v/v) with the overall concentration of 35 mg ml−1. The prepared solutions were heated at 90 °C before film casting for 15 min. The coated films were annealed at 70 °C for 10 min to evaporate the residual solvent and additional annealing at 80 °C for 5 min was performed to obtain the optimum result. All the procedures were carried out in a glovebox with N2, except those for ITO cleaning, and precursor spin coating for ZnO and ZnO–C60. Finally, a thin layer of MoOx (about 10 nm) covered with a layer of Ag (100 nm) as the anode was deposited successively in a vacuum thermal evaporator through a shadow mask at a pressure of less than 2 × 10−6 torr. The active area of the device is about 6.5 mm2.
