A free-standing membrane that consists of a newly synthesized spirobiindane-based microporous polymer carrying trimethylammonium hydroxide groups exhibited a good OH− conductivity of 65 mS cm−1 at 80 °C under 100% relative humidity, which demonstrates its potential for use in solid-state alkaline fuel cells.
