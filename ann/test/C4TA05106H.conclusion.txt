4.Conclusions
In summary, an imidazolium-tetraalkylammonium-based dicationic polymerized ionic liquid (PIL), poly(N,N,N-trimethyl-N-(1-vinlyimidazolium-3-ethyl)-ammonium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) has been successfully synthesized and characterized. Moreover, the ternary gel polymer electrolytes based on the as-obtained dicationic PIL as the polymer host in combination with 1,2-dimethyl-3-ethoxyethyl imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ionic liquid (IM(2o2)11TFSI) and LiTFSI salt in different weight ratios have been prepared, and their properties have been investigated. The dicationic PIL-based electrolytes exhibit low glass-transition temperatures, high thermal and electrochemical stability and acceptable ion conductivity, as well as satisfactory interfacial stability with metallic lithium. In particular, the Li/LiFePO4 cells with the ternary gel polymer electrolytes are capable of delivering discharge capacities of about 160 mA h g−1, 140 mA h g−1 and 120 mA h g−1 at a rate of 0.1 C at 40 °C, 30 °C and 25 °C, respectively, and show good capacity retention. In addition, the cells also present acceptable rate capability. Such impressive results, especially excellent battery performance at low–medium temperatures, make the dicationic PIL-based electrolytes prepared in this work promising electrolytes for very safe lithium metal batteries.
