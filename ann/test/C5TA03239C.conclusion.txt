4.Conclusion
In conclusion, we developed a novel low temperature synthesis-processing route for garnet-type fast Li-ionic conductors that are potential electrolytes for all-solid state batteries. We substantially decreased the particle size, revealed stable phases for the desired cubic Ga-doped Li-garnet structures, offered new insights into the role of Ga-diffusion in the evolution of the structures and phases, and concluded on sintering guidelines towards fast Li-ion conducting solid electrolytes.
Here, the tetragonal phase of Li7La3Zr2O12 was synthesized by a modified sol–gel – combustion method at a temperature of ∼600 °C, one of the lowest reported for garnet-type fast Li-ion conductors. Post-synthetic Ga-doping was shown to induce a phase transformation to the cubic phase at a very low temperature of ∼100 °C. The synthesis-processing route and the subsequent dilatometry and in situ XRD experiments were also suggested as model experiments to understand the role and effects of Ga-incorporation and diffusion on the tetragonal to cubic phase transformation. We demonstrate homogeneous distributions of Ga, La and Zr over the c-Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 nanoparticles by STEM studies. Due to the high sintering activity of c-Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 nanoparticles, processing temperatures were considerably decreased compared to the state-of-art. The small particle size of c-Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12, in the range of ∼300 nm, is expected to bring about further advantages in terms of an enhanced solid electrolyte–electrode assembly for the construction of all-solid state batteries.
AC electrochemical impedance measurements revealed high bulk Li-ionic conductivities in the range of ∼4.0 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 20 °C for the c-Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2O12 pellets processed at a rather low temperature of 950 °C for 6 h. Similar values are only reachable through more complicated and laborious methods, also employing much higher processing temperatures, pressures and longer sintering times. Besides, the investigations on 1100 °C sintered pellets through Raman spectroscopy and XRD powder diffraction confirm the rearrangement in the garnet structure with Li-loss for higher sintering temperatures, which further supports the benefits of the novel low temperature synthesis-processing route for garnet-type fast Li-ionic conductors. Thus, we provide insights into the correlation of Li-loss, Li+-conductivity, density and the (Raman) near order characteristics to further implicate on the best pellet processing conditions.
The new synthesis and processing route for garnet type fast Li-ion conductors is rather a simple “shortcut” and cost efficient in terms of strongly decreased annealing times and temperatures, but yet ensuring high Li-ion conductivities for battery electrolytes. Implication for all-solid state battery application is the option to employ nano-particles in tape-casting methods and to co-sinter through the nano-particle structure electrodes towards fast Li-ion transfer interfaces, which could enable the use of a broader range of electrode materials with potentially higher storage capacities.
