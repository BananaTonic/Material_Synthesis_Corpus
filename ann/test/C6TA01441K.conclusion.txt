4.Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated a self-healing and easily recyclable ferric ion cross-linked supramolecular PAA hydrogel electrolyte (KCl–Fe3+/PAA), and tested its electrochemical performance by assembling with GF@PPy electrodes. The non-covalent crosslinking provided the KCl–Fe3+/PAA hydrogel with favorable self-healing ability and easy-recyclability which have great significance in promoting the practical value of flexible supercapacitors. In addition, no environmental and safety problems will be caused by using the KCl–Fe3+/PAA hydrogel electrolytes due to their eco-friendly and ideal biocompatibility attributes. Moreover, the advantage of the facile fabrication process lays a solid foundation for industrialization. Hence, we believe that the KCl–Fe3+/PAA hydrogel may offer attractive prospects and could be extended to further applications because of its high performance, multi-function, and eco-friendly properties.
