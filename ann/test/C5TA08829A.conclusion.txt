4.Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated multifunctional UGAs with low volume shrinkage through hydrothermal reactions of the GO/dopamine colloidal solutions at mild temperature followed by freeze-drying and pyrolysis. The volume and density of the UGAs are controllable simply by regulating the GO concentration, dopamine concentration, and the temperature and time of hydrothermal reactions. The addition of dopamine forms crosslinking points among the GO sheets and results in partial reduction of GO in the hydrothermal reaction. In addition, the N atoms of dopamine were doped into the graphene sheets. The UGAs feature low volume shrinkage, ultralow density, excellent superhydrophobicity/superoleophilicity, and very high absorbency for organic liquids as well as excellent fire retardant properties and high conductivity. All these merits make the UGAs very promising materials for potential applications in many fields such as absorption of organic pollutants, sensors and energy storage.
