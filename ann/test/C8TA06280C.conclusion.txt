5.Conclusions
In this work, a thorough investigation on BaZrO3 doped with 10–25 mol% Y with an interval of 1 mol% was performed. After sintering at 1600 °C for 24 h, a bimodal microstructure was confirmed for BaZr1−xYxO3−δ (x = 0.10–0.15), whereas BaZr1−xYxO3−δ (x = 0.16–0.25) shows a quite uniform grain size. BZY10, BZY15 and BZY20 were selected and subjected to sintering for different time periods. Although a uniform grain size of around 2 and 6 μm was obtained for BZY15 and BZY20, respectively, the bimodal microstructure was maintained for BZY10 after sintering at 1600 °C for even 200 h. In addition, the bulk conductivity of BZY10 decreases by nearly one order of magnitude when the sintering time was extended from 24 to 40 h. These results indicate that the status of BZY10 is quite sensitive to the history of heat-treatment, calling for special attention when BZY10 is handled. A systematic evaluation of the transport properties was then performed. When the Y content is above 15 mol%, a total conductivity of over 0.01 S cm−1 is achieved even at 500 °C. And the transport number of ionic conduction in wet oxygen increases with the Y content increasing from 10 to 20 mol%, but does not further increase when the Y content is higher than 20 mol%. And notably, both Ba-deficiency and Ba-excess, deviating from the stoichiometric value of unity, result in a decrease in the transport numbers of ionic conduction in wet oxygen. Based on all the information collected in this work, a Y content of around 20 mol% seems to be the optimal composition for BZY to be applied as an electrolyte in fuel cells or electrolysis cells.
