4.Conclusions
A small crystallite size was found to be beneficial to stabilize the c phase and to improve the ionic conductivity in 10ScSZ nanofibers. The relatively low-conductive Î² phase is avoided in the nanofibers when the average crystallite size is smaller than 26 nm. As the average crystallite size decreased from 37 nm to 7 nm, the conductivity of nanofibers increased by more than 20 times. This was explained by the stable c phase combined with the enhanced conduction contributions from grain boundaries. The conductivity of the nanofibers increased by more than 900 times compared to that of bulk 10ScSZ. The size-dependent phase stability and exceptionally high conductivity achieved in this study suggest that the nanocrystalline 10ScSZ materials deserve great attention, which might find a range of potential applications in next-generation intermediate-temperature resistive sensors, electrochemical sensors, micro-fuel cells and all-solid-state batteries.
