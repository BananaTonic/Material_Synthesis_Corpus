Materials synthesis
LiOH (99%, Innochem), La2O3 (99.99%, Aladdin), ZrO2 (99.99%, Aladdin), B2O3 (99%, Mreda), Ta2O5 (99.99%, Macklin) and Li2CO3 (99.99%, Aladdin) were used as starting materials. La2O3 was dried at 900 °C for 10 h prior to use. Li3BO3 (LBO) was synthesized by ball-milling stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 and B2O3 and then sintered at 600 °C for 10 h in air. The solid-state method was employed to synthesize the Li7La3Zr2O12 samples. In terms of the stoichiometry, La2O3, Ta2O5, and LiOH were mixed using a small amount of isopropyl alcohol as the solvent. Excess 10% LiOH was used to compensate for the loss of Li during sintering. Then, the mixed powders were dried at 80 °C overnight and sintered at 900 °C for 10 h in air to obtain the LLZO powders. The pre-sintered powders were ball-milled for 20 h, die-pressed into pellets without meshing and calcined at 1000 °C for 24 h to fabricate the LLZO pellet samples. The Li6.4La3Zr2Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) pellets were similarly obtained, except for the stoichiometric addition of Ta2O5 to the starting mixing powder. The pre-sintered LLZTO powders were mixed with LBO at the molar ratio of 5 : 4 by ball-milling for 5, 10, and 20 h. Then, the mixture was die-pressed into pellets and sintered at 1000 °C for 24 h in air. Finally, the LLZTO/LBO pellets were prepared for measurements. The pellets were polished using sandpaper with grading from 600 pm to 1200 pm and 1500 pm prior to the performance tests. These pellets were referred to LLZO, LLZTO and LLZTO/LBO.
Characterization
The crystal structure was analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Ultima IV-185) with Cu Kα radiation at the scan rate of 8° 2θ min−1 and neutron powder diffraction (NPD). The NPD measurement was conducted using the ECHIDNA high-resolution powder diffractometer at the Bragg Institute, Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization (ANSTO). A wavelength of 1.6215 Å was used for the measurement, and each pattern was obtained for 3.5 h. The data set was further refined using GSAS EXPGUI. The morphologies of materials were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM 6340F, JEOL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, 200 kV). Via Mastersizer 2000 Ver. 5.60, the powder size was found to be in the range from 0.02 μm to 2000 μm using water as the dispersant. The ionic conductivity was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using the PGSTAT302N workstation (Metrohm Autolab) from 10−5 Hz to 10 MHz with a 10 mV perturbation amplitude. Both sides of the pellets were pasted with silver paste and then adhered on a Cu foil.
Cell assembly and measurements
The LiFePO4(LFP) + LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2(NCM) mixed cathode was fabricated for a solid-state battery. The mixed cathode was prepared by mixing 40 wt% LFP powder, 40 wt% NCM powder, 10 wt% PVDF in NMP and 10 wt% super P. The slurries were pasted on an Al foil and vacuum dried at 100 °C. The cells were assembled in an argon glove box. The LFP–NCM electrode was used as a cathode, with the LLZTO/LBO pellet as the electrolyte and the lithium metal sheet as the anode. The positive and negative electrodes were wetted with 10 uL of liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC/EMC (1 : 1 : 1 vol%)) with a pipette gun. The electrochemical performance was determined using the LAND test system with a constant current charge/discharge in the voltage range of 2.5–4.3 V vs. Li/Li+.
