Conclusions
In conclusion, the electrochemical decomposition mechanism of LLZO including delithiation, oxygen evolution, and phase transition, is comprehensively studied from DFT calculations and verified experiments, which has revealed that the electrochemical oxygen evolution barrier determines the EW of solid-state electrolytes. Based on polyhedral relaxation, reducing the number of O-p electron holes induced by delithiation plays an important role in improving the electrochemical stability. For the first time, it has been revealed that electronâ€“hole instability determines the EW of oxide solid-state electrolytes, which is clearly different from the bandgap and thermodynamic electrochemical dissociation. The polyhedral volume and rigidity (q/r3) are established to screen new materials and optimize structures for wide EWs. Based on this principle, LLZO with Nd3+, In3+, Sb3+, and Y3+ doping are predicted to have wider EWs of &gt;5.5 V. The present study provides new insights into improving the electrochemical stability of solid-state electrolytes by optimizing the [TMO6] structure.
