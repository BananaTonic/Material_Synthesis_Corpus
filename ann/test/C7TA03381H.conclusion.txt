Conclusions
Bismuth has been doped into the R–P phase La1.75Sr0.25NiO4+δ (LSN) to evaluate its influence on the properties of the host material, which include its sintering behaviour, thermal expansion, oxygen nonstoichiometry, surface exchange and diffusion kinetics, compatibility with common electrolytes, and polarisation resistance when used as a SOFC cathode. X-ray powder diffraction indicates that LSN retains its tetragonal K2NiF4 type structure after doping with 5 mol% bismuth to form La1.65Bi0.1Sr0.25NiO4+δ (LSN–Bi). Analysis of data from XPS, however, suggests that a small fraction (∼10%) of the bismuth ions may be in the oxidation state 5+. Bismuth doping lowers the sintering temperature from 1350 °C for LSN to 1200 °C for LSN–Bi to densify powder compacts into dense ceramics with a relative density above 98%. Both materials show excellent compatibility with electrolytes YSZ and SDC in terms of thermal expansion and chemical reactivity (&lt;900 °C). The electrical conductivity is metallic like and similar in magnitude for both LSN and LSN–Bi. For LSN–Bi, a conductivity of 100 S cm−1, a minimum value quoted for the design of the intermediate-temperature SOFC,35 is measured at a temperature of ∼570 °C. The data from electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) measurements demonstrate that the substitution of lanthanum by bismuth enhances Dchem and kchem by factors of 2–3. The faster kinetics of oxygen surface exchange and diffusion found for LSN–Bi relative to parent LSN is reflected by a lower polarization resistance of the former when the electrode performance of both materials is compared in symmetric cells. The corresponding values at 700 °C are 4.2 Ω cm2 and 0.61 Ω cm2 for LSN and LSN–Bi, respectively. LSN–Bi exhibits high peak power densities (328 mW cm−2 and 131 mW cm−2 at 700 and 600 °C, respectively), when incorporated into a fuel cell operated with humidified hydrogen as the fuel and air as the cathode gas. It is expected that its performance can be improved by optimization of the microstructure or when used in a composite cathode, and hence the material represents a promising candidate for further study.
