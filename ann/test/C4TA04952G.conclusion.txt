Conclusions
A novel high-temperature PEM consisting of hydrophilic PVP and hydrophobic PVDF is successfully synthesized by a facile polymer blending method. The PVDF–PVP hybrids are amorphous and show uniform microstructure with good thin film cast capability with the PVP content equal to or higher than 40 wt%. The PA doping level increases almost linearly with the PVP content, indicating that PA functional groups are primarily associated with the pyrrolidone ring of the PVP. With a PA doping level of 2.7 (mole number of PA per repeating unit of PVP), 20 wt% PVDF-80 wt% PVP or PVDF–PVP80 achieved a proton conductivity of 0.037 and 0.093 S cm−1 at 100 and 200 °C under 0% RH. This is better than or compatible with the state-of-the-art PBI/PA membranes. The PEMFCs with the PA/PVDF–PVP hybrid membrane demonstrate a maximum power density 530 mW cm−2 at 180 °C in H2/O2 and 0% RH. PA/PVDF–PVP membranes also show excellent performance stability at elevated temperatures. The soak-test in pure water also indicates the excellent structure of the blended membranes. The results demonstrate that PVDF–PVP hybrids are capable of operating at low humidity and elevated high temperatures, showing promising potential in applications as a proton transfer medium in high-temperature PEMFCs.
