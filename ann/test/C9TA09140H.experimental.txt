Results and discussion
The vermiculite nanosheets were synthesized from thermally expanded vermiculite crystals (Fig. S1–S3) by a two-step ion-exchange method.28,29 Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. 1a) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1b and S4) reveal the successful exfoliation of vermiculite nanosheets. A nearly transparent suspension of the as-prepared vermiculite nanosheets (∼1 mg mL−1) showing a distinct Tyndall effect (Fig. 1b, inset) can be achieved, verifying the homogeneous dispersion of vermiculite nanosheets in water. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the exfoliated vermiculite nanosheets shown in Fig. 1c and S5 indicate that most of the nanosheets possess a uniform thickness of 1.2 nm. The resultant suspension remains stable and transparent for even 25 months without appreciable precipitation (Fig. S6).

The as-synthesized suspension of monolayer vermiculite nanosheets allows us to fabricate vermiculite membranes by vacuum-assisted filtration using porous polyethersulfone (PES) substrates (Fig. 1d), as described in the Experimental section. After completely dissolving the substrates in organic solvents (Movies S1 and S2), a flexible and transparent membrane was obtained. It can be easily transferred onto various substrates, such as PET films, as shown in Fig. 1e. The thickness of the membrane can be facilely tuned using the concentration and volume of the vermiculite suspension. We also assembled the vermiculite nanosheets into large scale vermiculite membranes on PET or glass substrates using a spray-coating method (Fig. S7). In this way, vermiculite membranes at different size and thickness scales can be fabricated for various applications. All the resulting vermiculite membranes are highly transparent in the visible range (400–800 nm) and even a 10 μm-thick membrane achieves a transmittance of 90% (Fig. 1f), which can meet the requirements of transparent devices. Such superior transmittance of these vermiculite membranes is predominantly attributed to the unique natural transparency of the vermiculite nanosheet itself (Fig. 1b and S6), the uniformity of membranes and the ordered laminar microstructure.31 As shown in the surface SEM image (Fig. 1g), the vermiculite membranes are intact without structural distortion. The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 1h and i) reveal a highly ordered lamellar microstructure throughout the membranes, which is further confirmed by the sharp peak in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1j and S8).
Vermiculites are two-dimensional nanoclays consisting of alternately stacked, negatively charged host layers (zeta potential: −36.8 mV) and charge-balancing interlayer cations (Fig. 2a). This unique structure endows the vermiculite membrane with intrinsic conductivity, completely differing from the conventional electrolyte-in-gel composites (ion conductive hydrogels or ionogels) whose conductivity is primarily governed by externally doped electrolytes. Since the as-prepared vermiculite membranes were Li+ intercalated, we first investigated the Li+ conductivity. The representative Nyquist plots recorded at various temperatures are displayed in the inset of Fig. 2b, from which Li+ conductivity is calculated and plotted in Fig. 2b. The ion conductivity increases from 0.06 S cm−1 at 20 °C to 0.45 S cm−1 at 80 °C. The high conductivities of other cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Al3+) were also confirmed, implying the broad applicability of the vermiculite nanochannels for the fast transport of different kinds of ions. All cation conductivities (Fig. S9 and S10) are about 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional electrolyte-in-gel composite ion conductors, as shown in Fig. 2c.

The presence of 2D ordered interlayer nanochannels in the vermiculite membranes plays a vital role in affording high ion conductivity. It has been recognized that the highly ordered lamellar microstructure contributes much to creating ordered nanochannels for ion and molecular transport,28,38 conferring high conductivity or diffusivity on 2D material-based membranes such as graphene oxide,22,39 layered double hydroxide,24,25etc. In general, the conductivity of conventional electrolyte-in-gel composite ion conductors is in proportion to the concentration of the doped electrolytes. The migration of ions in the polymer host, which obeys a physical diffusion mechanism, is impeded by the tortuous pathways in the disordered polymer network, leading to an inferior ion conductivity (generally less than 10−2 S cm−1).6 In contrast, the ion transport behaves differently in the confined space of charged laminar nanochannels compared to that in electrolyte-in-gel composite ion conductors. In vermiculite membranes, to balance the surface charge in nanochannels, the counter-ion (Li+) is spontaneously enriched inside the nanochannels. The concentration of Li+ is determined by the surface charge density of nanochannels. From the ion exchange capacity (0.6 mmol g−1) and water uptake (20%, 30 °C) of vermiculite membranes, the value of Li+ concentration in nanochannels is calculated to be 3 M. Consequently, these balanced Li+ ions provide intrinsic ion conduction in the absence of external electrolytes. In addition, the 2D ordered laminar microstructure contributes to fast ion transport.
Stability is crucial for ion conductors in practical applications in complex environments. Owing to the intrinsic ion conduction and inorganic nature, the vermiculite membranes display high stability in organic solvents (Fig. S11). Even after soaking in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at 100 °C, little change in both mechanical properties and ion conductivity was found (Fig. S12 and S13). As shown in Fig. S14, the mechanical strength can be further enhanced (80 MPa) by cross-linking in glutaraldehyde vapor, which is several hundred times that of the conductive hydrogels (Fig. 2c). The microstructure of the vermiculite membranes after soaking in DMF (100 °C) was investigated. The intact architectures are well preserved as revealed by the surface and cross-sectional morphologies (Fig. S15 and S16). We also monitored the conductivity changes of both vermiculite membranes and conventional salt-containing conductive hydrogels stored in water and DMF. As shown in Fig. 2d, the conductivity of vermiculite membranes remains constant for 100 days, while the hydrogels exhibit a sharp decrease and then a total loss in ion conductivity within only 2 days due to the leakage of the electrolyte (LiCl). Sufficient bendability is important to make NICs membranes more adaptable for flexible electronics. We adopt bending angles from 60° to 180° to evaluate its flexibility, and the NICs membrane maintains a stable conductivity, as shown in Fig. 2e. Furthermore, 100 bending cycles (90°) were applied to the NICs membrane and the resulting constant conductivities and mechanical properties evidently demonstrate its superior flexibility (Fig. 2f and S17). The flexible vermiculite membranes can be easily attached to a human body (e.g. hands, arms, etc.), while completely maintaining structural integrity (Fig. S18). The thermogravimetric curve of the vermiculite membrane is presented in Fig. S19. The first weight loss stage of about 5% below 200 °C is related to the removal of moisture adsorbed in nanoclays. The slight weight loss of 5% from 200 to 800 °C proves its excellent thermal stability. To further explore its thermal tolerance, the ion conductivity of the vermiculite membrane was measured before and after thermal annealing at 300 °C for 12 h, as compared in Fig. 2g. The NICs membrane well preserves its ion conducting capability. The above results prove the application potential of the NICs membrane at high temperatures.
Another crucial issue for ion conductive hydrogels is the irreversible dehydration, which often permanently deteriorates its ion conductivity, transparency and mechanical properties. We compared the dehydration–hydration behavior of our NICs membrane and a conventional conductive hydrogel. The conductive hydrogel used for comparison is prepared based on polyacrylamide (PAAm) with 2 M LiCl salt, as previously reported in ref. 7. The conductive hydrogel underwent dehydration instantly at 80 °C in just a few minutes. The severe changes in volume and transparency of hydrogels led to the irreversible destruction of ionotronics (Fig. S20). Although the hydrogel could be rehydrated in water, it lost most of its LiCl salt during the dehydration–hydration process, and consequently its ion conductivity, as shown in Fig. S21. In comparison, the NICs membrane retained its microstructural integrity, mechanical properties, size, transparency and ion conductivity during the repeated dehydration–hydration cycling test, as shown in Fig. 2h and S22–S24. The excellent reversible dehydration–hydration performance of vermiculite membranes ensures their potential in practical applications.
A flexible, transparent and durable ion conductor is a key component of next generation touch panels.7 Herein, touch panels are fabricated using the as-prepared vermiculite membranes. For a one-dimensional (1D) ionic touch strip, when a grounded conductor touched the strip, such as a finger, current flows are formed from the two ends of the strip to the finger. The current magnitude is determined from the touch position (represented by a normalized distance, α) and is in proportion to the distance from the touch point to the two electrodes.7 Since the aligned 2D nanochannels in the NICs membranes favour in-plane ion transport, the touch panel can be made thinner, lighter and can even be operated at a lower voltage. The current signals are recorded using current meters at the two ends. As shown in Fig. 3a and S25,I1 decreases and I2 increases as the touch point moves from the A1 to the A2 electrode. Theoretically, the current values will decrease or increase linearly. However, we can only find a near linear current change in the middle section (α: from 0.3 to 0.6) of the strip. Fig. 3b and c present the current changes for different touch points (α = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6). Both current values of the A1 and A2 meters vary in proportion to the normalized distance and then return to the baseline when the probe is removed. Considering the intrinsic ion conduction feature and superior stability of our vermiculite membranes, we further investigated their potential utilization under harsh conditions. We immersed the vermiculite membrane touch panel in various organic solvents or annealed them at a high temperature (300 °C), and the hydrogel touch panel was treated under identical conditions for comparison. The hydrogel touch panel was broken down and lost its sensing function (Fig. S26). In contrast, the vermiculite membrane touch panel can completely recover its sensing ability by washing with deionized water several times. As shown in Fig. 3d, the recorded currents show negligible changes during the repeated annealing cycle test. Again, we performed the dehydration–hydration test on the touch panels to further validate the advantages of vermiculite membranes. Compared with its initial state, the hydrogel touch panel severely shrank in size and became brittle, which led quickly to the final integrity failure and, consequently, to a total loss in function (Fig. S27). The vermiculite membrane touch panel maintained its size and transparency during the dehydration process with a decrease of ion conductivity. When the dehydrated touch panel was soaked in water for just 5 seconds, it recovered to its initial state and sensed external touch stimuli again. Fig. 3e exhibits the current changes during dehydration–hydration cycles, indicating the high functional resilience of the vermiculite membrane touch panel.

(b and c) A1 and A2 currents were recorded for different touch positions (α = 0.3, 0.4, 0.6). (d) Current change of the A1 meter at three touch positions (α = 0.15, 0.3, 0.6). The vermiculite membrane was first heated at 300 °C for 12 h and then hydrated before testing. (e) Current change of the A1 meter during 100 dehydration–hydration cycles for two touch positions (α = 0.3, 0.6).
We next used a 2D touch panel to verify its touch locating ability. The working principle is similar to that of a 1D touch panel. Here, two normalized distances (α, β) are introduced to determine the touch positions.7,40 Eight points along concentric squares were sequentially touched to investigate the locating ability (Fig. S28) and the corresponding current values recorded using four current meters are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The coordinate of each touch point exhibited in Fig. 4c can be calculated from the recorded current values of four current meters (A1, A2, A3 and A4) using the following equations:12where I1, I2, I3, and I4 represent the recorded current values from current meters A1, A2, A3, and A4, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4c, we found that the calculated coordinates cannot match the touch points well, especially near the edges of the touch panel. This deviation has also been observed previously7,40 and can be reduced by modifying the above equations or using a polar coordinate. Since the development of the ionic touch panel is still in its infancy, there is much room for improving its locating precision. Finally, the touch panel was integrated with a computer through the controller board to realize real-time, human–machine communication. The touch panel can perceive various motions and the generated signals are converted to digital forms on computer displays through the controller board. Fig. 4d and e show the successful real-time drawing of a star shape and typing of the words “INTRINSIC ION CONDUCTOR” by using the NICs touch panel. Furthermore, it can maintain initial touch functions even after the dehydration–hydration process and annealing at 300 °C.
