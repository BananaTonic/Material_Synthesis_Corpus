Conclusions
In this contribution, a versatile free-standing GF has been successfully developed by the CH4-based CVD method. The exquisite foil with controllable density and thickness exhibited much higher electrical conductivity and less defects than that of the conventional graphene film which was even obtained by ultrahigh temperature annealing. It has been successfully applied as an efficient flame retardant material and employed as a light-weight corrosion resistant current collector to replace the commercial metal foil current collector in LIBs. The exceptional GF constitutes a significant scientific and technical advance toward the scalable production of multifunctional high-performance free-standing graphene, which should appeal to the development and practical application of new electronic and energy devices.
