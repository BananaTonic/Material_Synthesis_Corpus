Experimental
Materials
Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals and solvents were ACS reagent grade and used as received from commercial suppliers without further purification. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was dried over activated 4 Å molecular sieves, and triethylamine (TEA) and m-cresol were distilled before use. 4,4′-Diamino-biphenyl 2,2′-disulfonic acid (BDSA), received from TCI, was purple before purification. BDSA was purified by dissolving in an aqueous TEA solution and then precipitating upon the addition of 1 M HCl. The process was repeated until BDSA was obtained as a white solid which was then dried under vacuum at 70 °C overnight prior to use. Nafion 117, PVDF (Mw = 534 000 Da), and 1,4,5,8-naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (NTDA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. NTDA and benzoic acid were dried under vacuum at 170 °C and 60 °C overnight, respectively, prior to the polycondensation reaction.
Synthesis of sulfonated polyimide (triethyl ammonium salt) (SPI)
Under N2, BDSA (0.69 g, 2 mmol), TEA (0.7 mL, 5 mmol), and m-cresol (6 mL) were added to a 100 mL three-neck round bottom flask and were vigorously stirred with a mechanical stirrer. After the BDSA was completely dissolved at 80 °C, NTDA (0.53 g, 2 mmol) and benzoic acid (0.34 g, 2.8 mmol) were added. The reaction system was stirred at 80 °C for 4 h, and then additional m-cresol (20 mL) was added to dilute the viscous mixture. The reaction temperature was increased to 180 °C. After 14 h, the heating was discontinued, DMSO (100 mL) was added, and the system was allowed to cool. The mixture was poured into ethyl acetate (500 mL) to precipitate the polymer. The crude polymer was isolated by filtration and then re-precipitated twice by dissolving the polymer in DMSO (100 mL) and precipitating into ethyl acetate (500 mL). Finally, the SPI was dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight (1.1 g).
Film casting
Blend membranes were fabricated by the solvent-casting method. This procedure describes the preparation of 10 mg membranes. Predetermined amounts of PVDF and SPI were dissolved in DMSO in separate vials using magnetic stirring. Each solution was fixed at 0.02 g mL−1, and the total mass of SPI and PVDF was 10 mg. The two solutions were combined and stirred until the system was homogeneous. Membranes were solution-cast by adding the mixed solutions drop by drop onto a clean glass plate from ∼5 cm height at room temperature, typically covering a full ∼4 × 1 cm2 area, and carefully dried with infrared heat at ∼60 °C in air. The infrared heat must be uniformly applied to membrane surfaces to avoid inhomogeneous heating and ensure the desired morphology. After ∼3 hours, the membrane had turned translucent, and the glass plate was transferred to a vacuum oven at 80 °C for further drying overnight. The dried membranes (5–15 μm thick) were cut to size (∼3 × 0.5–1 cm2) and then removed from the substrate by immersing in water. The as-synthesized membranes were soaked in 1 M HCl for 48 h to ensure that all sulfonate groups in the membranes were in their acidic form. The membranes were then washed extensively with water, and prior to conductivity tests, PEMs were stored in Milli-Q water.
Characterization
1H NMR analyses were performed at room temperature in deuterated DMSO on a Varian UnityPlus 500 spectrometer at 500 MHz with the residual solvent proton signals as chemical shift standards. FT-IR spectra were acquired from a Mattson Galaxy 300 spectrometer purged with dry nitrogen, with the signal averaging 128 scans at a resolution of 4 cm−1. All FT-IR samples were dried, mixed with KBr, ground, and then pressed into pellets. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were carried out in air on Perkin-Elmer TGA 7 instruments at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. TGA samples were dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight prior to analysis. Dried samples were held at 120 °C in the TGA apparatus for 30 min prior to initiating the run. The microstructure of blend membranes was imaged using a JEOL-100CX transmittance electron microscope. To prepare membrane cross-sections for TEM analysis, membranes were immersed in 0.5 M AgNO3 solution overnight to stain the ionic domains by ion exchange of sulfonic acid groups for silver. Samples were rinsed with water, and then dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight. The stained membranes were embedded in epoxy resin, dried at 50 °C for 24 h, and then sectioned with an ultramicrotome to generate ∼100 nm thick slices. The slices were picked up with TEM copper grids.
Conductivity measurements
The membrane proton conductivities were measured with an alternating current (AC) impedance analyzer HP 4192A over the frequency range from 5 Hz to 13 MHz. Membranes were placed between two Pt electrodes in a home-made Teflon cell. The entire setup was kept in Milli-Q water at controlled temperatures for at least 10 min to saturate membranes and impedance was measured in the in-plane direction. From the Nyquist plot, the resistance of the membrane was estimated, and then the membrane proton conductivity was calculated using the electrodes distance and membrane cross-sectional area, as shown in eqn (1):1
where σ is the membrane proton conductivity, L represents the distance between two electrodes, A stands for the membrane cross-sectional area, and R is the bulk membrane resistance estimated from the Nyquist plot.
Water uptake
The water uptake of membranes was measured gravimetrically. After equilibration in Milli-Q water for two days at room temperature, membranes were removed from water, and weighed after the surface water was quickly removed using a Kim-wipe. Membranes were then dried under vacuum at 50 °C overnight and the weight of dried membrane was measured. The membrane water uptake was calculated according to eqn (2):2where Wwet stands for the mass of wet membranes and Wdry represents the weight of dried membranes.
Dimensional stability
Membranes were saturated in Milli-Q water for two days at room temperature before the dimensions of swollen membrane were measured. After drying under vacuum at 50 °C overnight, the dried membranes were measured. The swelling ratio was calculated from the length (longest dimension) of the membrane, as shown in eqn (3):3where Lwet and Ldry represent the lengths of wet and dried membranes, respectively. The uncertainty in the measurement is &lt;3%.
Theoretic ion exchange capacity (IEC)
The ion exchange capacity (IEC) of membranes was calculated from the molecular weight of SPI repeating unit and SPI weight content in each membrane. The IEC was calculated as shown in eqn (4):4where mH+ expresses the quantity of sulfonic acid groups.
