Materials
2-Dimethylaminomethacrylate (98%), methacryloyl chloride (98%), lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6, 98%) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDMA, average Mn = 400) were purchased from J&amp;K and used without further purification. The liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC 1 : 1 v/v) without any other additives (such as safety agents or fire retardant additives) was purchased from Tinci Company and used as supplied. Other chemicals were analytical-grade reagents obtained from Beijing Chemical Company and used as received.
Synthesis of 3-(dimethylamino) propyl methacrylate (DMAPMA)
3-(Dimethylamino) propyl methacrylate (DMAPMA) was prepared and purified according to the procedure published earlier by P. van de Wetering (Scheme 1).29 Briefly, to an ice-cooled solution of DMAP-OH (3.60 mL, 30 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (300 mL) triethylamine (8.32 mL, 60 mmol) was added under magnetic stirring, followed by the addition of methacryloyl chloride (5.38 mL, 54 mmol) dropwise after 30 minutes. After being stirred for 5 h at ambient temperature, the orange liquid was washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution, and then the organic layer was dried on Na2SO4 and filtered. The product was isolated by evaporation under reduced pressure, giving a 80% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, TMS standard, r.t.): δ (ppm) 6.10 (s, 1H, CCH), 5.55 (s, 1H, CCH), 4.20 (t, 2H, OCH2), 2.37 (t, 2H, NCH2), 2.24 (s, 6H, N(CH3)2), 1.95 (s, 3H, CCCH3), and 1.85 (m, 2H, OCH2CH2CH2N).

Synthesis of the PDMP-Li GPE
The synthesis route of the PDMP-Li GPE is shown in Scheme 2. The concentrations of DMAPMA (monomer) and PEGDMA (cross-linker) were 0.75 mol L−1 and 0.05 mol L−1, respectively. DMAPMA/PEGDMA was placed in a glass tube of 10 mm diameter and dissolved in the liquid electrolyte. The mixture was bubbled with nitrogen for 15 min. Finally, the tube was sealed and irradiated to form the gel with 10 kGy dose at a dose rate of 80 Gy min−1 at room temperature. The resulting gels were cut into cylindrical pieces and dried in air at 25 °C for one day. For comparison, PDMAPMA gels (short for PDMP) were prepared under the same gelation conditions but without the addition of LiPF6.

Characterization of the PDMP-Li GPE
Micro-FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the composition and thermal stability of the resultant gels. Micro-FTIR analysis was performed using a Nicolet (Magna-IR 750) spectrometer in the range of 5000–600 cm−1. TGA was carried out using a TA Q600 thermal analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere, over a temperature range of 25–600 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min. The gel fraction (GF) is defined as:1Gel fraction (%) = Wg/Wo × 100where Wg is the weight of the gel part and Wo is the original total dry weight.
The mechanical properties were measured using the as-synthesized gel which was cut into cylindrical pieces (d = 10 mm), and then the compression strength test was performed by using an Instron 3365 material test system at room temperature.
The electrochemical measurements were recorded using an electrochemical instrument (CHI-660D, Shanghai). The ionic conductivity of the GPE was measured with a symmetrical cell SS/GPE/SS by EIS. The GPE was sandwiched between two SS discs (diameter Ø = 16 mm). The ionic conductivity of the GPE was calculated from the bulk electrolyte resistance (R) according to:2where l is the thickness of the GPE, and S is the contact area between the GPE and SS disc. The bulk electrolyte resistance was obtained from the complex impedance diagram. In all the measurements for the electrochemical impedance spectra, the alternative current signal is from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with a potential amplitude of 10 mV.
In situ synthesis and characterization of the PDMP-Li GPE in pouch-type Li-ion cells
In situ synthesis and characterization of the PDMP-Li GPE were carried out in LiFePO4/graphite pouch-type cells. The production process of the pouch-type cells was similar to the commercial ones. The positive electrodes were obtained by coating the mixed slurry containing 92 wt% commercial-grade LiFePO4 active material, 3 wt% Super P, 1 wt% conductive graphite KS6 and 4 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) onto an aluminium foil collector. The negative electrodes were prepared by coating the mixed slurry of 93 wt% commercial-grade man-made graphite, 3 wt% Super P and 4 wt% poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) onto a copper foil. The chosen separator was commercial grade. The negative electrode, positive electrode, and separators (Celgard 2325, USA, 25 μm in thickness) were subsequently rolled together to make a cell core. The cell core was placed into cell shells made from aluminium films and dried at 85 °C overnight. The structure of pouch-type Li-ion cells and the preparation process of the PDMP-Li GPE are shown in Scheme S1. Injection of the excessive mixture liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC 1 : 1 v/v) containing DMAPMA/PEGDMA (0.75 mol L−1 and 0.05 mol L−1, respectively) was carried out in an Ar-filled glovebox, after resting for 30 min, and then the excess electrolyte and the formed gas were removed with a vacuum degassing machine to facilitate diffusion of the electrolyte into the cell core, the final remainder being the electrolyte of about 5 g A−1 h−1. Subsequently, the cells were sealed with a sealing machine and the assembled cells were placed in an oven (40 °C) for 24 h, ensuring that the electrolyte was fully absorbed.
Then the cells were irradiated with 10 kGy dose at a dose rate of 80 Gy min−1 at room temperature. In this process, the radiation-induced polymerization and crosslinking of DMAPMA and PEGDMA in the liquid electrolyte took place. Since the absorbed dose was only 10 kGy, during the irradiation, there was no significant change in the separators, which are mainly composed of polypropylene and polyethylene.30,31 Meanwhile, the PDMP-Li GPE was prepared in situ inside the cells by the one-step method.
The cell performances including charge–discharge curve and cyclic property were examined by using the charge–discharge testing device (NEWARE CT-3008-5V500 mA, Shenzhen, China). The cycling performance of the cells was evaluated at 0.1C and 25 °C between 2.3 V and 3.6 V. All the cells were charged at room temperature by the constant-current/constant-voltage (CC–CV) protocol. That is, the cells were charged at a certain current rate until the voltage reached to a limited voltage, followed by holding the voltage until the current dropped to 10 mA.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a frequency response analyser (CHI-660D, Shanghai) with an electrochemical interface in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at an amplitude of 5 mV and 25 °C.
The morphology of the electrode was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan), and the electrodes here were dried under vacuum at 60 °C for three days.
