Material characterisation
Fig. 1a compares room temperature X-ray powder diffraction patterns obtained for LSN of LSN–Bi. Analysis shows that both LSN–Bi and LSN have a tetragonal structure (space group I4/mmm). Table 1 lists the corresponding lattice parameters. These are found to be in good agreement with results reported previously for La1.7Sr0.3NiO4+δ.22 No evidence was found for impurities or secondary phase formation.

Effective radii of the involved ions are: Bi3+ (VI) = 1.03 Å, Bi3+ (VIII) = 1.17 Å, La3+ (VIII) = 1.16 Å, La3+ (XII) = 1.36 Å, Ni2+ (VI) = 0.69 Å, Ni3+ (VI) = 0.56 Å (low spin) (Roman numerals represent the coordination numbers). Ionic radii were taken from Shannon.23 To the best of our knowledge, data for the ionic radius of Bi3+ (XII) cations are not provided in the literature. For this reason, we compared the ionic radius of Bi3+ (VIII) with that of La3+ (VIII). Since both radii are very similar, while the radius of Bi3+ (VI) is much larger than that of possible nickel ions on the B-site, the probability for A-site substitution is considered to be much higher. Also, the similar cell parameters and volumes observed for LSN and LSN–Bi support substitution of Bi3+ on the A-site.
The chemical compatibility between the cathode and electrolyte is of crucial importance to the long-term stability of a SOFC. Montenegro-Hernández24 observed chemical reactivity between La2NiO4+δ (LNO) and both YSZ and Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO) in air above 900 °C and 700 °C, respectively. Contrary to the latter observation, using in situ high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction, Sayers et al.18 observed no chemical reactivity between LNO and CGO in air below 900 °C. In the present study, the chemical compatibility between LSN–Bi and electrolytes was examined by firing 50 : 50 wt% LSN–Bi/YSZ and LSN–Bi/SDC powder compacts in air at 900 °C for 5 h. The room-temperature XRD patterns of the obtained composites recorded after the heat treatment are shown in Fig. 1b. All the diffraction peaks can be assigned to either LSN–Bi or the respective electrolyte phases, suggesting that LSN–Bi is compatible with both electrolytes up to the temperature of 900 °C.
The FT-IR spectra of both LSN and LSN–Bi are shown in Fig. 2a. Based upon previous work on La2−xNiO4+δ,25 the peak at 505 cm−1 is assigned to the B–O stretching mode in the basal ab plane, while the peak at 677 cm−1 is assigned to the A–O stretching vibration along the c-axis. The average wave number of the latter decreases slightly from 677 cm−1 to 675 cm−1 upon partial substitution of La3+ with Bi3+ ions, indicating a minor decrease in the A–O bond energy.

The oxygen nonstoichiometry (δ) of LSN is found to be 0.0976 ± 0.01 as determined by iodometric titration. After doping with 5 mol% bismuth, δ increases to a value of 0.1105 ± 0.01, indicating an increased concentration of interstitial oxygen, and hence a higher ionic conductivity is expected for LSN–Bi relative to LSN.
Fig. 2b shows the deconvoluted XPS spectra of the Ni 2p2/3 region for LSN and LSN–Bi. The spectra show two well-resolved peaks centered at 855.3 eV and 851.6 eV for LSN, and 855.0 eV and 851.1 eV for LSN–Bi, assigned to Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively.26 Broad satellite peaks (not shown) are found at 863.0 eV for LSN and 862.5 eV for LSN–Bi. Ni2+ : Ni3+ ratios calculated from the fitted spectra are 1.34 and 1.07, corresponding to average valences of 2.43 and 2.48 for the nickel ions, for LSN and LSN–Bi, respectively. Calculation of the oxygen nonstoichiometry using these values yields δ = 0.090 for LSN and δ = 0.115 for LSN–Bi. Given the experimental error in quantitative XPS analysis, these values match favourably well with the values determined in this study by iodometric titration. In the calculations, it was assumed that the oxidation state of the bismuth ions is 3+. There is however evidence from the Bi 4f XPS spectra of LSN–Bi that about 10% of the bismuth ions are in the 5+ state (see ESI). O 1s and Bi 4f spectra are given in the ESI.
Sintering and thermal expansion
Shrinkage curves for LSN and LSN–Bi powder compacts are shown in Fig. 3a. It can be seen that the onset of sintering is reduced from 1000 °C for LSN to about 775 °C for LSN–Bi. The large decrease in the sintering temperature suggests a liquid phase sintering mechanism,27 but this needs further investigation. Fig. 4a shows a SEM micrograph of LSN–Bi ceramics sintered at 1200 °C for 5 h. The relative density amounts to 99.1%, whilst the average grain size is 1.62 ± 0.11 μm. The removal of holes and almost all of its porosity is indicative of a high sinterability of LSN–Bi. For comparison, Fig. 4b shows the microstructure of an LSN powder compact after sintering under similar conditions. A highly porous structure is obtained with a relative density of 72.1%. Only after increasing the sintering temperature to 1350 °C, densification to a relative density of 98.2% occurs. The average grain size of the obtained sintered LSN ceramics is 1.74 ± 0.12 μm.

Fig. 3b shows the thermal expansion curves for LSN and LSN–Bi. The average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of LSN between 200 and 800 °C is 11.2 × 10−6 K−1, which is in good agreement with that reported for La1.7Sr0.3NiO4−δ (11.3 × 10−6 K−1).28 The average TEC of LSN–Bi in the same temperature range is slightly higher: 11.4 × 10−6 K−1. Both TECs are, however, noticeably lower than that of perovskite cathodes such as La0.3Sr0.7CoO3−δ (25.0 × 10−6 K−1),29 Sr0.9Ce0.1FeO3−δ (20.2 × 10−6 K−1),29 La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ (17.5 × 10−6 K−1),29 and of double perovskite cathodes such as PrBaCo2O5+δ (21.5 × 10−6 to 24.6 × 10−6 K−1)15 and PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.7Ni0.3O5+δ (19.7 × 10−6 K−1).30 Contrary to these oxides, the observed TECs of LSN and LSN–Bi both match very well with values reported for YSZ (10.5–11.0 × 10−6 K−1)31 and SDC (12.3 × 10−6 K−1).32
Electrical conductivity
Fig. 5 shows the electrical conductivities of LSN and LSN–Bi. Both conductivities are found to decrease with increasing temperature. For La2−xSrxNiO4+δ, this has been often explained by a decrease of the charge carrier density due to the loss of interstitial oxygen. Analysis of data of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity, however, strongly supports that the charge carriers are itinerant in La2−xSrxNiO4+δ (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4).33 The positive values of the Seebeck coefficients indicate that electron holes are predominant in the pO2 range 10−4 to 1 atm.33 For LSN, the magnitude of the electrical conductivity from this study is in excellent agreement with previous results.34 As seen from Fig. 5, when LSN is doped with bismuth, the electrical conductivity increases slightly from 99.3 S cm−1 to 100.3 S cm−1 at 550 °C. This increase, though expected to be close to the experimental error, may be correlated with the higher oxygen content of LSN–Bi compared with LSN. A conductivity threshold of 100 S cm−1 has been quoted for the design of intermediate-temperature SOFCs.35 For LSN–Bi, this conductivity is obtained at a temperature of ∼570 °C.

Electrical conductivity relaxation
Typical normalized conductivity relaxation transients for LSN and LSN–Bi, following a pO2 step change from 0.21 to 1 atm, are shown in Fig. 6a. These illustrate the faster re-equilibration for LSN–Bi after a pO2 step change relative to that observed for LSN. The Arrhenius plots of the values of Dchem and kchem obtained from fitting the normalized conductivities to the appropriate solution of Fick's second law are shown in Fig. 6b and c, respectively. These show that in the temperature range covered by the experiments, both Dchem and kchem are enhanced by a factor of 2–3 upon doping of LSN with 5 mol% bismuth. The obtained results meet our expectations in that doping with bismuth enhances the oxygen transport properties. In part, this can be explained by the higher concentration of oxygen interstitials in LSN–Bi compared to LSN. The enhancement is probably also due to the higher diffusivity of oxygen in the doped material associated with the high polarizability of bismuth cations.20 Values of Dchem and kchem for LSN obtained in this study are found to be in fair agreement with published data for La1.8Sr0.2NiO4+δ and La1.8Sr0.2Ni0.95Mo0.05O4+δ by Gómez et al.32 For comparison, a value for Dchem of 1.35 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 at 800 °C was measured for LSN in this work, while Gómez et al.32 reported a value of 5.0 × 10−6 cm2 s−1 at 800 °C for La1.8Sr0.2NiO4+δ, and 2.5 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 at 825 °C for La1.8Sr0.2Ni0.95Mo0.05O4+δ; a value for kchem of 1.50 × 10−4 cm s−1 at 800 °C was measured for LSN in this work, while Gómez et al.32 reported a value of 3.5 × 10−4 cm2 s−1 at 825 °C for La1.8Sr0.2Ni0.95Mo0.05O4+δ. Regrettably, no data of kchem were provided for La1.8Sr0.2NiO4+δ by Gómez et al.32

Electrochemical performance
Symmetric cells LSN/SDC/LSN and LSN–Bi/SDC/LSN–Bi were constructed to measure the polarization resistance of the LSN and LSN–Bi electrodes. Fig. 7a shows typical Nyquist plots from EIS measurements at 700 °C. The spectra were fitted using the equivalent circuit Rs(R1Q1)(R2Q2)(R3Q3), where Ri (i = 1, 2 and 3) is a resistance, Qi (i = 1, 2 and 3) is a constant phase element, and Rs is the apparent ohmic resistance of the electrolyte. In Fig. 7a, Rs has been subtracted to enable comparison of the total polarization resistance (Rp = R1 + R2 + R3) of both electrodes. The individual arcs (R1Q1), (R2Q2), (R3Q3) are highly convoluted, and this is reflected in the depressed nature of the arcs in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 7a). The convoluted nature of the arcs is primarily due to an inherent convolution of contributions (i.e., overlapping time processes) associated with chemical processes, including oxygen absorption, solid-state diffusion, and gas-phase diffusion inside and outside the electrode and the fabricated microstructures.36 In fact, the above equivalent circuit is used in many studies. In general, however, there is little consensus in the assignment of the individual arcs, albeit that the low frequency arcs are usually attributed to surface processes such as oxygen adsorption, dissociation, and charge transfer.36 A distribution of relaxation time analysis (DRT) was performed on the impedance spectra measured at 700 °C (Fig. 7a). In a DRT plot the location of a peak reflects a characteristic relaxation time, while the peak area is a measure of the polarization loss. As seen from Fig. 7b, at least five different processes can be identified in the DRT analyses of both impedance spectra. Fig. 7b further demonstrates that bismuth doping reduces the associated contribution to overall polarization of all these processes. Clearly more research is needed to identify the nature of these processes.

Fig. 7c shows the Rp values of both electrodes in the temperature range 500–800 °C. The figure makes it clear that bismuth doping reduces Rp of the LSN cathode by almost one order of magnitude, i.e., from 4.2 Ω cm2 to 0.61 Ω cm2 at 700 °C. The observed value for Rp is in the range reported for many double perovskite cathodes such as PrBaCo2O5+δ and PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.7Ni0.3O5+δ. This class of materials has been reviewed recently by Pelosato et al.9 due to their promise for use as cathodes in intermediate-temperature SOFCs. As mentioned before, a major advantage of LSN–Bi over perovskite-based cathodes is the close match of its TEC and that of common electrolytes.
The performance of the LSN and LSN–Bi cathodes was further investigated in a dual-chamber fuel cell, using Ni/YSZ as the anode and bilayered YSZ/SDC as the electrolyte. Peak power densities of 269 mW cm−2 and 76 mW cm−2 at 700 and 600 °C, respectively, were observed for the LSN cathode, as shown in Fig. 8a. In line with the observations from the symmetric cell tests, significant improvements in power density at similar temperatures are observed for the cell with the LSN–Bi electrode: 328 mW cm−2 and 131 mW cm−2 at 700 and 600 °C, respectively (Fig. 8b). With optimization of the microstructure of the LSN–Bi electrode, e.g., by preparing a functionally graded electrode20 or adding an electrolyte to form a composite electrode, it is expected that its performance can be improved and hence the material represents a promising candidate for further study.
