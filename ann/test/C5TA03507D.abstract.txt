This work studies Nafion based proton exchange membranes (PEMs) modified by a metal–organic framework–graphene oxide composite (ZIF-8@GO). The ZIF-8@GO/Nafion hybrid membrane displays a proton conductivity as high as 0.28 S cm−1 at 120 °C and 40% RH, resulting from a synergetic effect of ZIF-8 and GO.
