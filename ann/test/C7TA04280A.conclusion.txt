Conclusions
The thermoelectric properties of the Te-PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite were successfully enhanced by mixing with a small amount of nanocarbon such as GNPs or SSWNTs. The electrical conductivity was highly increased, despite a slight decrease in the Seebeck coefficient. In particular, the electrical conductivity of SSWNT-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS was significantly enhanced when compared with that of GNP-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS because of the interconnected bundle structure of the SSWNTs. Compared to the plate structure of GNPs, the long bundles of SSWNTs could form an interconnected network within the Te-PEDOT:PSS nanostructure, which could facilitate carrier movement. In addition, the SSWNT-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS showed higher carrier concentration than the GNP-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS. The optimized power factor of Te-PEDOT:PSS with 0.3 wt% of SSWNTs was 206 μW m−1 K−2, with a Seebeck coefficient of 118 μV K−1 and electrical conductivity of 139 S cm−1, which is much higher than that of Te-PEDOT:PSS with 0.8 wt% of GNPs (94 μW m−1 K−2). The TEG fabricated from SSWNT-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS showed a maximum output power of 126 nW, which is 18 times higher than that of GNP-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS. Using an all-printing process, a bendable and highly efficient TEG that generated a small amount of electricity from human body heat was fabricated. The flexible TEG showed moderate output power of 62 nW, with a stable thermoelectric voltage of over 7.8 mV in response to heat from the human body.
