4.Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated an effective strategy to address the high resistance at the NMC||LLZA interface. The liquid phase process of the Li2SiO3 buffer layer could easily wet the surface of both NMC and LLZA resulting in the reduction of the interfacial resistance from 6.5 × 104 Ω cm2 to 675.3 Ω cm2 (25 °C) and 351 Ω cm2 (100 °C). An all-solid-state battery consisting of the NMC cathode, LLZA pellet and Li–metal anode demonstrated an initial discharge capacity of 138 mA h g−1 and stable cycling performance over 10 cycles at 100 °C. In addition, a quasi-solid-state battery at room temperature with an initial discharge capacity of 165 mA h g−1 shows stable cycling over 50 cycles at a higher current density of 100 μA cm−2. The present investigation shows that a micron sized Li2SiO3 layer not only wets both NMC and the LLZA pellet but also assists the lithium conduction to the active material and provides good adherence to the solid electrolyte. Therefore, it is critical to choose the proper interfacial layer material and design of the interfacial structure between electrodes and the solid electrolyte for the improved performance of ASS lithium metal batteries.
