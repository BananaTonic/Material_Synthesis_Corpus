Conclusions
We report a flexible and transparent ion-conducting membrane based on 2D nanoclays of intrinsic conductivity (NICs) for emerging human–machine communication applications. The ordered laminar microstructure provides fast ion transport nanochannels, exhibiting an ultrahigh ion conductivity up to 0.45 S cm−1 at 80 °C. The inorganic nature and intrinsic ion-conducting features endow the membrane with high thermal stability and ion conductivity resilience under harsh conditions, including soaking in organic solvents, annealing at 300 °C and repeated dehydration–hydration cycles. We used a real-time, human–machine communicator based on a surface-capacitive touch system enabled by NICs membranes. The as-assembled ionic touch panel can be operated again after high temperature shock and dehydration–hydration without compromising its functionality. These attributes make two-dimensional nanoclays of intrinsic conductivity promising building blocks for flexible and transparent ionotronics in future human–machine interfaces.
