4.Conclusions
We have developed an advanced series of quaternized copolymers (QPAF-4) composed of perfluoroalkylene and fluorene functionalized with pendant hexyltrimethylammonium groups. The resulting copolymers did not contain any heteroatom linkages in the main chain. A simple two-step synthesis involving polymerization and quaternization provided the QPAF-4 copolymers with high molecular weights and controllable IECs. The copolymers were soluble in polar aprotic solvents and provided bendable and tough membranes by solution casting. The QPAF-4 membranes exhibited a volcano-type dependence of the hydroxide ion conductivity as a function of the IEC because of the large water absorbing properties of the high IEC membranes. Balanced conductivity and water uptake properties (86.2 mS cm−1 in water at 80 °C and 105% at r.t.) were obtained for the QPAF-4 membrane with IEC = 1.47 meq. g−1. The absence of heteroatom linkages in the main chain and the introduction of hexyl spacers for the pendant ammonium groups contributed to improving the alkaline stability. The QPAF-4 membranes retained hydroxide ion conductivity under harsh alkaline conditions in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution at 80 °C for 1000 h. Post-test analyses of the 1H NMR spectra, solubility, and mechanical properties revealed no, or negligible, structural and property changes. A hydrazine alkaline fuel cell using the QPAF-4 membrane was successfully operated with humidified oxygen or air. The maximum power density obtained was 515 mW cm−2 at a current density of 928 mA cm−2 with oxygen, proving that the QPAF-4 membrane functioned well in an operating fuel cell. The durability of the membrane was further confirmed in long-term operation (&gt;1000 h) at a constant current density.
