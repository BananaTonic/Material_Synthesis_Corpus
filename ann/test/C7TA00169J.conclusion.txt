Conclusions
In conclusion, a hexaphosphate ester-based 3D MOF, JUC-200, was successfully synthesized using the bioavailable ligand PA and Zn(ii). The resultant structure endows JUC-200 with high stabilities against water and acid. Because of the high water content and the terminal water molecules in the structure, JUC-200 has shown good proton-conductive properties with a conductivity of 1.62 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 80 °C in water. This type of MOF with high stability and excellent conductivity is rare in proton-conductive MOFs and holds great promise for further use in PEMFCs. PVA was also blended with JUC-200 to fabricate polymer composite membranes. The JUC-200@PVA-10 shows good proton conductivity of 1.25 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 50 °C. The conduction mechanisms of JUC-200 as well as its composite membrane JUC-200@PVA-10 have also been theorized. As is known, this is the first report on fabricating water- and acid-stable MOF-based composite membranes for proton conduction. For the MOFs to progress further in PEMFCs, this work may be regarded as having a certain pioneer role.
