4.Conclusions
Aryl ether-free 2,7-diphenylfluorene-based copolymers tethered with Qui cations on hexyl spacers were successfully synthesized via superacid catalyzed Friedel–Crafts polycondensation and subsequent quaternization reactions. Compared with the performances of membranes based on corresponding copolymers carrying TMA and Pip cations, the Qui-functionalized AEMs were efficient OH− conductors and in addition showed the highest thermal and alkaline stability in the series. Careful analysis of protonated membrane polymers by 1H NMR spectroscopy proved to be an efficient method to identify ionic loss mechanisms and to quantify degradation products after the alkaline treatments. This revealed that the Qui cation had a very high resistance against β-elimination under the conditions investigated, with no detectable elimination in the ring structure and to a significantly lower degree in the alkyl spacer chain as compared with the corresponding TMA and Pip cations. The high alkaline stability of the bicyclic Qui cation may be attributed to the low ring strain of the 6-membered rings, in combination with the very strong conformational restrictions imposed by the cage-like structure which most likely contribute to a very high transition state energy of the elimination reactions. In addition, no degradation of the aryl ether-free copolymer backbones was detected, even after storage of AEMs in 10 M NaOH at 90 °C. Hence, the overall findings demonstrate that the strategy of combining aryl ether-free backbone polymers and Qui cations results in durable and high-performance AEMs suitable for use in, e.g., alkaline fuel cells and water electrolyzers.
