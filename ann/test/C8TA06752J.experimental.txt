Experimental
Membrane preparation
The membrane dispersion (DE2021, Dupont) was dried in an oven at 50 °C for 3 days to evaporate the existing solvent. After the solvent had been completely evaporated, the remaining Nafion polymer was washed with deionized water and dried for 24 h. The dried Nafion was dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a ratio of 10 g Nafion to 25 mL DMAc. The bottle of solution was kept in the oven at 50 °C for one week. Two kinds of membranes were cast using the prepared Nafion solution. One is the membrane prepared with the electric field in the in-plane direction, as shown in Fig. 3(a), and the other is the membrane treated in the through-plane direction (Fig. 3(b)). As shown in Fig. 3(a), metal plates were attached to the glass with intervals of 4 cm, and the solution was cast on the glass. With the cast solution, an electric field was applied to both sides of the metal plate at 0 V (in-plane pristine) and 50 V (in-plane modified). In Fig. 3(b), electric cables were connected to a doctor blade and a stainless-steel plate to apply the electric field in the through-plane direction. Electricity was applied at 0 V (though-plane pristine), 2.0 V (N 2.0), 2.3 V (N 2.3), 2.5 V (N 2.5), 2.7 V (N 2.7), and 3.0 V (N 3.0) while the solution was cast. After casting process, all membranes were dried at 50 °C to evaporate the solvent and annealed at 100 °C to fix the arranged structure of Nafion. Other than the cast membranes, Nafion 117 was also used to compare its proton conductivity to those of the cast membranes.

Transmission electron microscopy observation
A diluted membrane solution containing 2 g of Nafion in 90 mL of DMAc was used to prepare a Nafion membrane. Before casting the solution, a thin glass slide (Marienfeld) had been immersed in 1 M sulfuric acid (OCI Corp.) at 60 °C for 3 h. The glass was then washed with deionized water and wiped with a soft tissue to remove water. In the next step, silver paste was printed on the glass in the shape of two rods, which were used as electrodes, as shown in Fig. 4. Then, the Nafion electrolyte was spread over the printed glass and treated by spin coating, in which the conditions were 1000 rpm for 1 min and 3000 rpm for 5 min. After the spin coating process, an electric field was applied to the silver paste at 50 V for 1 h. The cast membrane was dyed with lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2, Sigma-Aldrich) and set on the copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Then, the membranes were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100).
Preparation of electrically aligned sample for TEM analysis.
X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
A membrane aligned in the through-plane direction was prepared to determine the inner structure of the membrane by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The cast membranes (pristine, N 2.0, and N 3.0) were prepared as 20–30 μm of thickness for observation. For XRD, the sample was scanned with a range of 5–30° in 2θ. The signals and backgrounds of the samples were determined and analyzed using HighScore Plus 4.1, and the diffraction peaks were analyzed using Origin Pro 9.1. In this step, the main diffraction peaks were divided into a sharp crystalline peak and a broad amorphous peak following the method of Taromi et al.19 For the FT-IR experiments using a JASCO V-700 series UV/vis near (N)IR spectrophotometer (Jasco Corp.), the membranes were measured in parallel to aligned direction with transmission mode between 800 and 1500 cm−1. The background was measured using a blank test and subtracted from the measured data.
Conductivity measurements
The cast membranes and commercial membrane were soaked in 1 M hydrochloric acid (OCI Corp.) for 24 h before the proton conductivities were measured. Then, the impedance of the in-plane pristine and in-plane modified membranes was measured using the four-probe cell, as shown in Fig. 5(a), connected to an impedance analyzer, Autolab (Metrohm). For these measurements, Nafion 117, in-plane pristine, and in-plane modified membranes were used. For the in-plane modified membrane, the conductivity was measured parallel and perpendicular to the direction that the electric field had been applied. Then, the conductivities of the membranes were calculated using eqn (1), where w is the width, R is the resistance, T is the thickness, and L is the separation between the electrodes. For the through-plane case, the conductivities of membranes N 2.0, N 2.3, N 2.5, N 2.7, and N 3.0 were measured using a lab-made conductivity cell, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The determination of the proton conductivity was carried out with interfacial resistance correction. The interfacial resistances were measured with pressure control, and the conductivity without interfacial resistance was calculated using a previously described method.13Eqn (2) shows the calculation of the through-plane proton conductivity, where T is the thickness, Rt is the measured resistance, Ri is the interfacial resistance, and A is the area of the electrodes.12
