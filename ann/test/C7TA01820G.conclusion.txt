Conclusions
In summary, a new NaFNFSI/PEO (EO/Na+ = 15) SPE was first prepared by a facile solution-casting method. The ionic conductivity of the NaFNFSI/PEO SPE can reach 3.36 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 80 °C, and its decomposition temperature and oxidation potential are up to 300 °C and 4.87 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively. Furthermore, the NaFNFSI-based SPE can deliver an excellent interfacial stability with Na metal, in terms of chemical and electrochemical evaluations. More importantly, the NaFNFSI-based SPE can also afford high initial reversible capacity (e.g., 122.4 mA h g−1 at 0.1C), good cycling performance (e.g., a capacity retention of 70% after 150 cycles at 1C), and excellent current-rate capability for the Na|SPE|NaCu1/9Ni2/9Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cell. Therefore, the NaFNFSI/PEO SPE is proposed as an alternative electrolyte for application in solid-state Na batteries.
