2.1Materials
Graphite was supplied by Asbury Graphite Mills, Inc, United States. Dopamine hydrochloride (98%) was purchased from Shanghai DEMO Medical Tech Co., China. H2SO4, NaNO3, KMnO4, H2O2, HCl, triethylamine, ethylenediamine, sodium sulfite, chloroform, dichloromethane, n-hexane, toluene, ethanol, petroleum ether, vacuum pump oil and Oil Red O were purchased from China National Medicines Corporation Ltd. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.
2.2Preparation of UGAs
GO was prepared by a modified Hummers method.11 The UGAs were prepared according to the following procedure. Typically, an appropriate amount of GO aqueous solution was dispersed in water by ultrasonication for 2 h in order to dilute and strip the GO sheets thoroughly. Then, 0.5 mL of dopamine aqueous solution (20 mg mL−1) was added into 5.75 mL of GO dispersion (3.27 mg mL−1), and stirred for 2 min to form a uniform pH 2.0 solution. Subsequently, the solution was sealed in a 45 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 85 °C for 12 h to transform the brown aqueous solution into a black nitrogen doped-graphene hydrogel. Finally, the hydrogel was freeze-dried to form the NGA, which was further calcined in an N2 atmosphere at 1000 °C for 2 h to form the UGA.
2.3Characterization
The micrographs of the samples were taken using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6701F, JEOL) and a field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM, TECNAI-G2-F30, FEI). Before SEM observation, all samples were fixed on copper stubs and coated with a layer of gold film (∼7 nm). The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was done on the attachment to the SEM. For TEM observation, the samples were prepared as follows. A drop of the solution was put on a copper grid and dried in the open atmosphere. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an X'pert PRO diffractometer under working conditions Cu Kα, 30 mA and 40 kV (λ = 1.54060 Å). The scanning was done at room temperature between 3 and 40° in 2θ with a scanning speed of 0.02° per second. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the samples were recorded by using a Thermo Nicolet NEXUS TM spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. The surface chemical composition of the samples was analyzed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a VG ESCALAB 250 Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromated AlKα X-ray radiation source and a hemispherical electron analyzer. The spectra were recorded in the constant pass energy mode with a value of 100 eV, and all binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as the reference. Rheological tests of the samples were measured using a Physica MCR301 rheometer (Anton Paar, Germany) at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure. Zeta potentials of samples were measured on a Malvern ZEN3600 Zeta voltmeter (Britain). The measurement of the contact angle (CA) of water was performed using a Contact Angle System OCA20 (Dataphysics, Germany). The syringe was positioned in a way that the water drop (7 μL) could contact the surface of the samples before leaving the needle. A minimum of six readings were recorded for each sample. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a STA 6000 simultaneous thermal analyzer (PerkinElmer Instrument Co., Ltd USA) in the range of 25 to 1000 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. The electrical conductivity of the aerogel was measured using a four-probe resistivity meter (Kund Technology Co. Ltd Guangzhou, China). The specific surface areas of samples were analyzed using an Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry System (Micromeritics, ASAP2020, Atlanta, USA) using N2 as an adsorbate at −196 °C. The specific surface area was calculated by the BET method. The total pore volume was obtained from the volume of N2 held at the relative pressure P/P0 = 0.95.
