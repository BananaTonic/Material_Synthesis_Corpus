Conclusions
In this study, we disclosed a novel fluorinated copolymer bearing cyclic carbonate pendant groups that fulfils the criteria for use as a solid polymer electrolyte after loading with a lithium salt. The interesting features of this system are triggered by the microphase separation between the crystalline PVDF and amorphous poly(VDF-co-MAF-cyCB) nano-domains. Indeed, the presence of the reinforcing crystalline PVDF nano-domains results in decent thermal and mechanical properties with moduli values ranging between 105 and 106 Pa. The addition of LiClO4 further enhances the mechanical properties up 107 Pa at 102 rad s−1 for the poly(VDF-co-MAF-cyCB) copolymer with a cyCB/Li+ ratio of 5. These high shear rate moduli, which are typically observed for elastic solid materials, can mitigate or even prevent the formation of lithium dendrites in batteries.
The added LiClO4 dissolved in the amorphous poly(VDF-co-MAF-cyCB) phase leads to excellent ionic conductivity values. Indeed, amorphous PVDF is known for its ability to dissolve lithium salts. Similarly, the MAF-cyCB counterpart is also capable of dissociating large amounts of lithium salt because of the high dielectric constant of the cyclocarbonate unit. Moreover, the localization of this moiety as a pendant group to the polymer backbone imparts good mobility to the system. These positive features are also reflected in the rather high lithium ion transference numbers (0.68 obtained at 40 °C). Finally, the studied SPE displays an electrochemical stability window ranging from 1.4 V to 4.9 V vs. Li/Li+.
It should be however noted that the addition of LiClO4 above a critical threshold leads to the probable formation of ionic clusters inducing a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties as well as the ionic conductivity features.
On the basis of these observations, we believe that poly(VDF-co-MAF-cyCB)/LiClO4 SPEs are valuable and promising candidates for further use in all-solid-state batteries.
