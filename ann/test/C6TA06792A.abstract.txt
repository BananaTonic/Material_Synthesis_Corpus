The development of cost-effective proton-conducting materials with high conductivity and water stability is currently of great interest in fuel-cell technology. By using a simple aqueous solution method, a water stable 3D Eu-MOF material, [Me2NH2][Eu(ox)2(H2O)]·3H2O (1), can be easily synthesized from oxalic acid (H2ox) and Eu(NO3)3·6H2O on a large scale. 1 possesses a dia net topology and an extensive hydrogen-bonded network consisting of dimethyl ammonium and water molecules in 1D channels. 1 shows a high proton conductivity of 2.73 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 55 °C and 95% relative humidity, and it is used as a sensitive luminescent sensor for Cu2+ ions in aqueous solutions.
