Conclusions
In summary, a novel and facile synthetic route for the construction and preparation of a binder-free flexible supercapacitor electrode that is based on zero- and one-dimensional nanostructured materials has been presented. Such a 3D CNFS–PANI nanohybrid material can be achieved by covalently grafting aniline-functionalized silsesquioxane and hyperbranched polyaniline onto the surface of carbon nanofibers. The Friedel–Crafts acylation reaction was utilized to introduce carboxylic groups onto the nanofiber sidewalls and OASQ was then uniformly covalently attached to CNF-COOH. Carboxylation, amidation of CNFs and the grafting of PANI on CNFs were confirmed by FT-IR, Raman, UV-Vis and WXRD spectrum analyses. We have also shown that PANI can be grafted from the reactive phenylamino groups on CNF-SQ, yielding a microporous–mesoporous hierarchical pore structure with a mean pore width of 2.77 nm and the surface area in the range of 16.8 to 20.6 m2 g−1. FE-SEM micrographs showed that the surfaces of CNFS–PANI nanohybrids are covered with a large quantity of pisolitic PANI nanoparticles ranging from several tens to hundreds of nanometers. We speculated that the nanosized structure of OASQ acts as a template upon which some PANIs propagated into nanoparticles on the sidewall of CNFs. On the other hand, we found that CNFS–PANIs are connected with each other to form a 3D cross-linked carbon network through PANI nanoparticles. Such a 3D porous interconnected carbon network not only showed a significantly improved electrical conductivity, but also could maintain good mechanical strength. In addition, the PANI networks were partially composed of nanobundles with the average diameter in the range of 30–50 nm in TEM. Furthermore it is worth mentioning that the grafting of PANI, the hierarchical porous network structure and the high conductivity allow a considerable improvement of the electrochemical performance for the free-binder flexible supercapacitor electrodes. The calculated discharge capacitance of CNFS–PANIs (102 F g−1) was 40 times higher than that of the CNF (2.5 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1. We conclude that the developed unique nanohybrid could be a promising candidate for flexible and lightweight energy storage devices from low-cost carbon materials.
