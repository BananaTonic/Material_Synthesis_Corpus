4.Conclusions
In summary, the Li+ conductivity in bulk perovskite LLTOs is highly dependent on the structural disorder and chemical composition of the A-site in the given structure. Otherwise, the boundary resistances of LLTOs have a direct correlation with the microstructure of the domain boundaries in the particles. As a partial effort to reduce the large boundary resistances of LLTOs, we demonstrate the effect of microstructural factors on the Li+ conducting behavior. We suggest that the domain size is a predominant factor for determining the Li+ conducting behaviors associated with the boundary resistances of perovskite LLTOs. Moreover, the Li concentration at the boundaries has a strong correlation with its domain boundary resistance. Thus, we suggest that more attention should be paid to controlling microstructural factors to develop highly conductive LLTO solid electrolytes for practical use in all-solid-state lithium battery applications.
