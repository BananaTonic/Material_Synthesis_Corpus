2.1Synthesis
The Na0.03Sn0.97Se polycrystalline sample was synthesized by directly melting stoichiometric amounts of elemental sodium (Na, 99.999%), tin (Sn, 99.999%) and selenium (Se, 99.999%) in a sealed quartz tube (10−4 Torr). Then, the tube was heated up to 1193 K, held for 30 min, and then rocked at this temperature for another 30 min in a rocking furnace to ensure the homogeneity of the sample composition. The tube was then air-cooled. Ball milling (SPEX8000) process was used to reduce the ingots into fine powders. The powders were then consolidated by hot pressing into a graphite die of Φ1 = 10 mm diameter at 643 K for 8 min under a uniaxial pressure of 60 MPa. This sample has been labeled as “HP”. The hot deformation (HD) process was performed by pressing the HP sample into a larger graphite die at a higher temperature. One part of the HP sample (Φ1 = 10 mm) was pressed into a graphite die of Φ3 = 16 mm diameter at 743 K under the same pressure. The obtained sample was labeled as “HD1”. The other part of the HP sample (Φ1 = 10 mm) was pressed into a graphite die of Φ2 = 12.7 mm diameter at 693 K, and then further into a graphite die of Φ3 = 16 mm diameter at 743 K. This bulk sample was labeled as “HD2”. It is easy to see that the HD1 sample is hot deformed once and the HD2 sample is hot deformed twice after the hot pressing process.
2.2Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using Bruker D8 (Cu Kα radiation λ = 1.5406 Å) at room temperature. The structures of the fractured surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Quanta FEG 250). Electrical conductivity (σ) and Seebeck coefficient (α) were measured simultaneously using ULVAC-RIKO ZEM-3. The thermal conductivity, κ, was calculated from the specific heat (CP), the thermal diffusivity (D), and the sample density (ρ) using the equation κ = ρCPD. The density (ρ) was measured using the Archimedes principle. The thermal diffusivity (D) was measured by the laser flash method (Netzsch LFA-457). The specific heat value was taken from previous reports.8,9 The Hall coefficient (RH) was measured using a physical property measurement system (Quantum Design, PPMS-9). The carrier concentration (n) was calculated using the formula n = 1/eRH, and the carrier mobility (μ) was estimated as μ = σ/ne.
