2.1Material preparation
The BaZr1−xYxO3−δ, and BaZr0.8M0.2O3−δ (M = In, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb) samples were prepared by a conventional solid state reaction method. Starting materials of BaCO3, ZrO2, Y2O3, In2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3, and Yb2O3 were mixed at the desired ratio, and ball milled for 24 h. After being pelletized under 9.8 MPa, the samples were heat treated at 1000 °C for 10 h. Then, the samples were pulverized and ball milled for 10 h, and pelletized under 9.8 MPa again, with a subsequent heat-treatment at 1300 °C for 10 h for the synthesis. The samples were pulverized and ball milled for 100 h again, and pressed at 392 MPa into pellets with a thickness and diameter of around 1 mm and 11 mm, respectively. Finally, the resulting pellets were buried in sacrificial powder which is a mixture of the as-synthesized powder and 1 wt% BaCO3, and subjected to sintering at 1500, 1550 or 1600 °C in an artificial oxygen atmosphere. The heating rate was 4.17 °C min−1 from room temperature to 1000 °C, and 3.33 °C min−1 from 1000 °C to the target temperature for sintering. The samples of BaZr1−xYxO3−δ (x = 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20) were quenched at room temperature in an ambient atmosphere after the sintering was performed at 1600 °C to see the phase behavior at 1600 °C, whereas the other samples were furnace cooled to room temperature.
2.2Characterization
Chemical compositions were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with a SPS4000 (Seiko Instruments Inc., Chiba, Japan). The samples were dissolved in 0.1 mol L−1 nitric acid solution kept at around 80 °C with several droplets of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Microstructures were observed by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) with a JXA-8530F (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using Cu Kα radiation with an X'Pert PRO MPD or Cu Kα1 monochromatic radiation with an X'Pert PRO Alpha-1 (PANalytical, Almelo, Netherland). Rietveld refinement was carried out utilizing commercial software X'Pert HighScore Plus to determine lattice constants. The relative density of the as-sintered pellet-like samples was estimated with Archimedes' method.
Conductivity measurements of the pellet-like samples with sputtered platinum (Pt) electrodes were performed in wet atmospheres of hydrogen, oxygen or those diluted with argon. The partial pressure of water vapor in the wet atmosphere was 0.05 atm obtained by bubbling the gas through deionized water kept at 33 °C. All the samples were fixed in alumina rings with zirconia cement (S-301, Asahi Chemical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) to improve the mechanical strength. Pt plates wiped with a silver mesh were used as current collectors. Pt wire was used to lead the current to a frequency response analyzer (Solartron SI 1260, Solartron Analytical, Farnborough, UK). The impedance spectra were collected in the frequency range from 10 Hz to 7 MHz with an applied voltage of 100 mV. For completing the Arrhenius plots, the impedance spectra were collected every 50 min by cooling from 700 to 100 °C at 0.2 °C min−1. For evaluating the transport numbers of ionic conduction, another sample was used to collect the impedance spectra at only three specific temperatures of 500, 600 and 700 °C, with a relaxation time of around 10 h and 1 h for changing temperature and atmosphere, respectively. Commercial software ZView (Scribner Associates, Inc., USA) was used to analyze the impedance spectra. The semicircles belonging to bulk and grain boundary resistance were determined from their specific capacitance of 10−11 and 10−9 F, respectively, and also a continuous change of the profile of the spectra with the change in temperature was observed (Fig. S1). The resistances of bulk and grain boundaries are determined by reading the value at the valley between two adjacent semicircles. And the total resistance was determined by reading the value at the valley between the grain boundary and electrode.
