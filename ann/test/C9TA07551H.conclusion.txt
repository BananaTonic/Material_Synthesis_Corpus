Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated an in situ strategy to construct a borate decorated anion-immobilized SPE for all solid state LMBs, which achieves adequate mechanical strength, superior ionic conductivity and an enhanced Li+ transference number. With the high-performance P(V–B) electrolyte, the assembled LMB exhibits long-term cycling stability without dendrite formation on the Li anode at various temperatures (10–60 °C). Simulation and characterization results indicate that the stable performance is attributable to the in situ formation of an electrochemically stable interface which eliminates inhomogeneous dendrite nucleation, anion-immobilization by borate groups to regulate non-uniform deposits and the adequate mechanical strength to suppress dendritic Li growth. This combination of innovative synthesis design and facile fabrication provides new insights into interfacial stabilization, Li dendrite inhibition and eventual practical applications of high-energy and safe LMBs.
