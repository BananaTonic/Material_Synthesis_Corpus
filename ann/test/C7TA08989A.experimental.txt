Experimental
Ba3WNbO8.5 was prepared by the solid-state reaction of stoichiometric amounts of the starting materials BaCO3 (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich), WO3 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Nb2O5 (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich). The starting materials were ground, pressed into a pellet and calcined in an alumina crucible for 10 h at 900 °C. The pellet was then reground, pelleted and heated at 1300 °C for 10 hours before being cooled to room temperature at a rate of 5 °C min−1. The latter heating step was repeated until a phase pure product was obtained.
X-ray powder diffraction patterns were collected at room temperature on a PANalytical Empyrean Powder diffractometer with Cu Kα1 radiation. Data were recorded in the range 5° &lt; 2θ &lt; 70°, with a step size of 0.0131°. Time of flight (TOF) neutron powder diffraction data were collected at room temperature (∼20 °C) on the Polaris diffractometer at the ISIS pulsed neutron source, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. ∼5 g of Ba3WNbO8.5 were loaded into an 8 mm diameter cylindrical vanadium can and data acquired in all 5 detector banks (covering a continuous d-spacing range from ∼0.2 Å &lt; d &lt; 25 Å) for ∼300 μA h integrated proton beam to the ISIS target (corresponding to ∼2 hours exposure). The morphology of the sintered pellets was monitored using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Carl Zeiss Gemini 300). The sample was covered with a thin layer of sputtered gold.
A pellet of ∼10 mm diameter was prepared from a powdered sample of Ba3WNbO8.5 and sintered for 10 hours at 1300 °C to achieve ∼92% of the theoretical density. Pt electrodes were painted on both sides of the pellet using a Pt-paste (Metalor 6082). Impedance spectroscopy measurements were recorded in the frequency range 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with a Solartron 1260 impedance analyser. Data were recorded upon cooling from 700 °C to 450 °C in a sealed tube furnace under a dry flow of air, nitrogen, oxygen and 5% hydrogen/nitrogen. The impedance data were measured every 15 °C with 2 hours of equilibration time at each temperature. The geometrical factor (the ratio of surface area to thickness of the pellet) was used to correct the data obtained and the data was treated with the ZView software.
