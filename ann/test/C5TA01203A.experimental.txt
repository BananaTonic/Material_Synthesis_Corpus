3.Results and discussion
3.1Deposition behavior of LSGM single splats
We first deposited single splats on polished YSZ substrates with a deposition temperature of ∼350 °C to study the deposition behavior. Fig. 3 shows the surface morphologies of the splats deposited at a spray distance of 90 mm. Clearly, the individual splats exhibited a regular disk shape because the desorption of the possible adsorbents from the substrate surface occurred prior to the impinging of the droplet when the substrate was preheated to the above mentioned deposition temperature. Moreover, the splats showed a smooth surface with no cracks, attributed to the high deposition temperature and beneficial to the formation of a dense electrolyte membrane.

The elemental compositions of the plasma-sprayed LSGM splats were determined using EDX. While the contents of La, Sr, and Mg in a splat were very close to those of the starting powder, Ga was found to evaporate during the spraying process. In order to study and quantify the loss of Ga due to evaporation, the content of La was used as the reference because of its low vapor pressure.41,42
Fig. 4(a) shows the effects of the splat diameter and spray distance on the molar ratio of Ga to La. It was found that the molar ratio of Ga to La varied from 1 in the starting powder to a value less than 0.1, depending on the splat diameter and spray distance. At a spray distance of 30 mm, the molar ratios of Ga to La for all splats with different particle sizes were very close to 1.0, indicating that Ga evaporation can be ignored. When the spray distance was increased to 50 mm, the molar ratio of Ga to La reduced to ∼0.68 in the splats with a diameter of ∼15 μm. However, it was found that the molar ratio increased with the increase of the splat diameter, approaching ∼1.0 when the splat diameter was increased to ∼80 μm. The molar ratio remained unchanged when the splat diameter was further increased. Moreover, when the spray distance was increased to 70, 90, and 110 mm, the molar ratio of Ga to La reduced to ∼0.1 for the splats of 10–15 μm in diameter, indicating that almost 90% of Ga evaporated during the spraying process. Moreover, the molar ratio also increased to 1.0 when the splat diameter increased to over 80 μm at these spray distances.

Through the measurement of the diameter, thickness and volume for each splat using 3D confocal laser scanning microscopy, the apparent diameter of molten spray particles prior to deposition can be calculated for each splat supposing that spray particles are in a spherical shape. Thereafter, the relationship between the Ga/La ratio and the splat diameter can be converted to the relationship between the Ga/La ratio and spray particle diameter under individual spray conditions. Supposing that the evaporation loss of La element can be neglected, the Ga/La ratio of each splat reflects Ga evaporation loss during in-flight of the spray particle with the plasma jet. Fig. 4(b) shows the effects of particle size and spray distance on Ga evaporation loss. The molar ratio of Ga in the starting powder is equal to that of La. Based on the results shown in Fig. 4(b), it is clear that spray particle size influences significantly Ga evaporation loss during plasma spraying of LSGM. When the particle diameter is larger than 30 μm, Ga evaporation can be neglected for the whole in-flight process. When the particle diameter is less than 30 μm, Ga evaporation of a spray particle takes place in three distinct spray distance regions with the spray particle travelling in the plasma jet. When the spray distance is less than 30 mm (stage I), no evaporation was observed for all the particles. However, when the spray distance increased from 30 mm to 70 mm (stage II), Ga evaporation loss increased with the increase of the spray distance. Moreover, no further Ga evaporation loss was observed when the spray distance became larger than 70 mm (stage III). Moreover, the evaporation loss increased with decrease of the particle size when the particle diameter was less than 30 μm. Therefore, it is clear that Ga evaporation of LSGM spray particles during plasma spraying mainly occurs during in-flight from 30 mm to 70 mm for the particles of diameter less than 30 μm.
3.2Numerical analysis of the properties of plasma gas and in-flight particles
To gain some insight into the evaporation phenomenon, which is determined mainly by the particle temperature and its dwelling time within the high-temperature region of the plasma jet, the in-flight particle parameters were studied using numerical simulation. The particles are injected into the plasma jet at a distance of 10 mm away from the exit of the torch nozzle. The parameters of spray particles are determined by the interaction of the spray particle with the plasma jet, which is in turn determined by the properties of the plasma gas inside the torch. Therefore, we first examined the properties of plasma gas inside the torch and the plasma jet by numerical analysis. Shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively, are the simulated gas temperature and velocity distribution inside the torch under the parameters listed in Table 1 for electrolyte deposition. The gas temperature and velocity distributions are almost axisymmetrical inside the torch. The plasma core temperature is ∼34 000 K. The maximum velocity inside the torch is ∼2100 m s−1 at the throat because of the expansion of the nozzle. The gas temperature and velocity distribution at the torch exit were used as the gas inlet boundary conditions for the simulations of plasma jet. The calculated gas temperature and velocity distributions of the plasma jet are shown in Fig. 5(c) and (d), respectively. The gas temperature and velocity decrease rapidly with the increase of the axial distance. The simulated gas temperature and velocity of plasma jet and inside the torch are close to those reported in the literature.36–38

The simulated temperature and velocity for in-flight particles of different diameters are shown in Fig. 6. The particle velocity increases with increase of the spray distance up to 50 mm and then decreases with the further increase in the spray distance. Moreover, the maximum particle velocity increases with the decrease in particle size. Besides, from the particle surface temperature, it can be analysed that when it reaches the melting point (1700 °C) the melting process begins, and the particle completely melts when the core temperature exceeds the melting point. As can be seen from Fig. 6(b), the particle with the size of 10 μm begins to melt at the spray distance of 8 mm and entirely melts at 21 mm (from Fig. 6(c)). Even the particle with the size of 50 μm begins to melt at 28 mm; however, the particle diameter is large hence its core does not melt at 100 mm. According to the melting process, the melting degree (volume fraction of the liquid phase) for in-flight particles of different diameters is shown in Fig. 6(d). Moreover, both the maximum particle surface temperature and core temperature increase with the decrease in particle size. When the particle diameter is larger than 30 μm, its temperature is lower than 2500 °C. However, for the powder with a particle size of 10 μm in diameter, the particle surface temperature reaches &gt;3500 °C, which is much higher than the melting point of LSGM.

3.3Process and mechanism of Ga evaporation
Based on the numerical analysis, Ga evaporation mechanisms can be proposed to explain the effect of particle size and spray distance on the melt flow within the spray particle using the spherical Hill vortex model,43,44 which predicts that significant convective movement of molten melt takes place within the droplet (a fully molten particle). As shown in Fig. 4, two mechanisms are responsible for Ga evaporation during in-flight of the LSGM spray particle. As can be seen from Fig. 6(d), when a LSGM particle is injected into the plasma jet, it is heated to a molten state gradually from the particle surface and thus the thickness of the molten layer gradually increases. The reported results indicate that the evaporation rate of Ga in LSGM almost increases exponentially with the increase of temperature.41,42 Since Ga evaporates much faster at a temperature over the melting point of LSGM,41 it evaporates from the surface rapidly, resulting in a shell with less Ga and Ga evaporation will then be controlled by the outward diffusion of Ga element from the inside of the droplet. As schematically shown in Fig. 7, spray particles in stage I are rapidly heated to the highest surface temperature based on the evolution of particle temperature shown in Fig. 6(b), leading to remarkable Ga evaporation. It may be expected that Ga evaporation occurs remarkably. However, it is clear, as shown as in Fig. 4, that Ga evaporation was then limited by the mass transport through the Ga-deficient surface layer, due to the limited diffusion time with high velocity in-flight particles. Thus, a stable Ga-deficient surface layer forms a barrier to protect the LSGM spray particle from further loss of Ga.
Schematic diagram of the evaporation process for the particles in the plasma jet.
On the other hand, when the spray particle is fully molten, the Hill vortex convection through the molten droplet takes place in the case that the Reynolds number (Re = ρD|Vg − Vp|/μ, where ρ, Vg, Vp, D, and μ are the density, gas velocity, particle velocity, particle diameter, and viscosity, respectively) of the droplet is large enough, which results from the difference of kinematic viscosities between the liquid droplets and surrounding media.44 For particles with a size &lt;30 μm, the full molten state can be reached at the spray distance of ∼30 mm, as predicted by the simulation results (Fig. 6(d)). Rapid Ga evaporation from the surface results in a Ga-deficient shell. However, the generated vortex continuously destroys the shell, being a diffusion kinetic dominant layer, through turbulent mixing of the melt within the liquid splat. As a result, rapid mass transport of Ga element within the whole molten particle occurs by vortex flow, leading to rapid redistribution of Ga uniformly throughout the bulk volume of the droplet. With the disappearance of the shell, the fresh liquid phase with a high Ga content was exposed on the particle surface and evaporated continually. The intensity of the convective movements was almost proportional to the Reynolds number. The simulation results indicate that the particle temperature, which significantly affects the viscosity, decreased with a decrease in particle size. In general, the viscosity of a droplet is proportional to temperature. Therefore, the intensity of the convective movements of the smaller particles was much higher than that of the larger particles. For the particle with a size of 30 μm, the evaporation begins to increase at the spray distance of 50 mm (Fig. 4). This is because the particles reach the full molten state at ∼50 mm (Fig. 6(d)) and the vortex flow effect starts at this spray distance. When the particle diameters are more than 30 μm, the intensity of the convective movement could be ignored. This is because when large particles reach the full molten state, the velocity difference between the particles and the plasma jet becomes much less and the vortex flow effect becomes negligible. Therefore, the evaporation of LSGM particles depends on the effect of vortex flow during the in-flight state. Since the smaller particles reach the full molten state fast with a larger velocity difference from the plasma jet, Ga loss of the smaller particles is much greater than that of the larger particles.
Moreover, this model can also be used to explain the effect of spray distance on evaporation. Fig. 8 shows the comparison of simulated particle surface temperature and velocity for the 10 μm particles with that measured by DPV-2000. It was obviously found that the particle temperature and velocity measured by DPV-2000 agreed well with the simulation results. In stage I, Ga evaporation can be neglected due to the low temperature and limited diffusion time. As discussed above, in stage II, the evaporation increased with the increase of spray distance, showing a linear relationship. This can be attributed to the convective movements as confirmed above. On the one hand, as shown in Fig. 8(a), the 10 μm particle in stage II has a high temperature, greater than 3000 °C. On the other hand, there is a big velocity difference between the spray particle and the plasma gas around it (Fig. 8(b)), implying that there is strong convection inside the full molten particle. However, for a spray distance of &gt;70 mm (stage III), the evaporation changed slightly with the increase in the spray distance. On one hand, the particle temperature decreased rapidly when the spray distance was &gt;70 mm. Thus, the evaporation rate decreased with the decrease in temperature. On the other hand, when the spray distance exceeded 70 mm, the particles flew out of the jet core. As shown in Fig. 8(b), the velocities and temperatures of the plasma jet and particles converged, thus decreasing the Reynolds number rapidly. As the kinematic viscosity decreased rapidly, the convective movement stopped. Therefore, at distances farther than 70 mm, the dominating mechanism of evaporation is the element diffusion, which is a very slow process. Therefore, the evaporation changed slightly with the increase in the spray distance when it was &gt;70 mm. Thus, the evaporation mainly occurred within the first 30–70 mm downstream of the nozzle exit.
Simulated temperature and velocity compared with the experimental results for the 10 μm particle: (a) in-flight particle temperature; (b) particle and plasma gas velocity.
As shown in Fig. 7, two types of evaporated particles may be present after the evaporation. One of the types fully remixed during the convection process; thus, the particle showed a uniform composition (particle I). However, there was another type of particle (particle II) where a stable shell was maintained or another evaporated shell was formed after the convection process. For this particle, the composition was not uniform. The Ga content in the shell was much lower than that inside the particle. This type of particle with a thin Ga-deficient shell may also be found for the particles with a size more than 30 μm because of the rapid evaporation from the surface. Besides, the third type was the particle without Ga evaporation resulting from the big spray particle.
Fig. 9 shows the microstructure of the fractured LSGM splats. First, the splats showed a thickness of ∼0.8 to 1.2 μm and bonded well with the substrate. Then, three types of splats as mentioned above were found. The first type of splat with a rough fractured surface which contained many small grains (50–100 nm) is shown in Fig. 9(a). EDX analysis showed that almost all the Ga evaporated in this type of particle. Another type is shown in Fig. 9(b). In this type, the Ga-deficient shell with a thickness of ∼300 nm was observed at the lower portion of the splat. As indicated by the arrows, this region also contained small grains. Moreover, EDX analysis showed that Ga in the evaporated shell was much lower than that in other regions. The third type of splat without Ga evaporation is shown in Fig. 9(c). It was found that this type of splat presents a smooth and homogeneous fractured surface.

3.4Behavior of interlamellar bonding formation
The microstructure of plasma-sprayed ceramic coatings depends not only on the particle size, particle temperature, and particle velocity, but also on the deposition temperature.26 As shown in Fig. 10, the LSGM electrolyte deposited without preheating the substrate (&lt;150 °C) produced a typical lamellar structure. The non-bonded interfaces and intra-splat cracks (as indicated by arrows) are clearly present in the deposit, yielding a porosity of ∼5.5 ± 0.5%. Thus, the plasma-sprayed LSGM following the conventional routine is not suitable for high performance SOFC electrolytes because of low conductivity and poor gas tightness.

However, as shown in Fig. 11, when the substrate was preheated to a temperature higher than 300 °C, the non-bonded interfaces and intra-splat cracks in the deposit disappeared. The deposited LSGM had a dense microstructure with well-bonded lamellae, and the porosity was reduced to ∼2.3 ± 0.7%. The increase of the lamellar bonding ratio and decrease of intra-splat cracks and porosity improve the electrolyte conductivity and gas tightness.

Our previous investigation26 showed that when the deposition temperature is higher than 680 °C, the microstructure of YSZ coatings deposited by APS changes from the typical lamellar structure with limited lamellar bonding to the continuous columnar crystal structure. Moreover, for plasma-sprayed Al2O3 coatings,45 the mean interface bonding ratio increased significantly when the deposition temperature was higher than 500 °C. The recent investigations reveal that there is a critical deposition temperature for the spray molten droplet to bond completely with the previously deposited splats,46,47 which is referred to as the critical bonding temperature. The present study indicated that the critical bonding temperature of LSGM was lower than 300 °C, which is far lower than that of YSZ because the melting point of LSGM (∼1700 °C) is much lower than that of YSZ (∼2700 °C). Therefore, it is the low critical bonding temperature of LSGM that benefits the application of APS to prepare dense electrolytes.
3.5Effect of Ga evaporation on the microstructure and phase structure
3.5.1Microstructure
Fig. 12(a) shows the cross-sectional microstructure of the as-deposited LSGM using powder A, which contained many small particles less than 30 μm in diameter. A close examination revealed the existence of some white-striped regions with a thickness of ∼0.5 to 1 μm, as shown in the inset in Fig. 12(a). The EDX line scans of La, Sr, Ga, and Mg elements across this region are shown in Fig. 12(b). The results indicate that these regions have less Ga and relatively more La. Therefore, it is clear that these Ga deficient regions were formed by the droplets which experienced significant Ga evaporation. These regions are present on the fractured cross-section as shown in Fig. 12(c). It is evident that the Ga deficient regions contain small grains with a size of 50–100 nm, which can be recognized from the splat shown in the inset of Fig. 12(c). Moreover, the Ga deficient regions were also recognized on the fractured surface of the annealed deposits (Fig. 12(d)).

(c) Fractured cross-section of the as-sprayed LSGM electrolyte prepared using powder A. (d) Microstructure of the annealed deposit prepared using powder A.
Fig. 13(a) shows the TEM bright-field image of a cross-section of the as-sprayed LSGM electrolyte. The EDX mappings (Fig. 13(b)) show that the striped region (with a thickness of ∼300 nm) has less Ga, corresponding to the above-mentioned Ga-deficient region. The diffused halo rings in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns indicate that both sides of the Ga-deficient region contain an amorphous phase (as marked by C in Fig. 13(a)). The formation of an amorphous phase can be attributed to the rapid solidification process inherent to the thermal spray process, as observed in other investigations.32–34 Moreover, the SAED patterns revealed that the Ga-deficient region has a cubic perovskite structure, even though this region is poor in Ga. However, as shown in Fig. 13(c), the electron diffraction image of the Ga-deficient region (marked as A in Fig. 13(a)) revealed many defects such as missing atoms and irregular arrangements in this region because of Ga deficiency. Moreover, the HR-TEM image (Fig. 13(d)) of the region marked as B in Fig. 13(a) shows that the interface between the Ga-evaporated and non-evaporated regions has a chemical bonding.

To compare the structural differences between the Ga-deficient and Ga-rich regions, we examined the crystal structure of the region without Ga evaporation in the deposit using HR-TEM, as shown in Fig. 14(a). The EDX analysis showed that Ga evaporation is negligible in this region. The SAED patterns indicate that this region has a cubic perovskite structure with high crystallinity. Fig. 14(b) shows the electron diffraction image of the region marked as A in Fig. 14(a). The atoms in this region were neatly arranged, and crystal lattice disfigurement was not observed. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Ga evaporation slightly affected the crystal; however, crystal lattice disfigurement occurred during the droplet solidification process.

Our results suggest that the plasma-sprayed LSGM deposits with negligible Ga evaporation can be achieved using LSGM powders with a particle size of &gt;30 μm. Indeed, when powder B, which consisted of some fine powders (&lt;30 μm), was used to deposit the LSGM electrolyte, the results were much better. Fig. 15(a) and (b) show the microstructures of a polished and fractured cross-section of the LSGM deposit prepared from powder B, respectively. The polished cross-section shows that the deposit has a dense microstructure, with few closed pores. Moreover, a few semi-molten particles were present in the deposit because the large-size particles did not melt completely.

However, a good interface bonding was observed between the completely molten and semi-molten particles. Moreover, as predicted, the white-striped regions were not found in the deposit, indicating that Ga evaporation was insignificant in the spraying process. Fig. 15(b) shows the cross-section of the deposit; this result also reveals that the interfaces of the splats deposited by fully molten or semi-molten particles were bonded well together. Furthermore, apparent Ga-deficient regions were also absent in the fractured cross-section of the deposit.
3.5.2Phase structure
Fig. 16(a) shows the XRD patterns of the LSGM deposits prepared from powder A. First, the original powders exhibited a single phase of perovskite structure similar to the standard XRD pattern of undoped LaGaO3 (PDF 24-1102), and no other impure phase was observed. Second, the as-sprayed deposit contained large amounts of amorphous phase identified by a broad peak with the maximum intensity at a 2θ angle of ∼32°. Previous studies reported that the recrystallization temperature of the amorphous phase in the as-sprayed LSGM deposit was ∼800 °C.32–34 Therefore, the deposit was annealed at 800 °C in air for 5 h. After the annealing, the LSGM deposit had a high degree of crystallization, and the broad peak of the amorphous phase disappeared. However, a small amount of a new phase, LaSrGaO4, was observed in the annealed deposit. Fig. 16(b) shows the phase structure of the LSGM electrolyte prepared from powder B. Clearly, it has a single-phase perovskite structure. Moreover, the amorphous phase was also present in the as-sprayed deposit, similar to the deposit prepared from powder A. However, the annealed deposit showed a single phase without the impurity phases observed in the annealed deposit from powder A. Therefore, it can be concluded that the formation of LaSrGaO4 in the annealing process can be attributed to Ga evaporation, resulting in a metastable structure in these Ga-deficient regions.

Fig. 17 shows the cross-sectional crystal orientation and phase distribution map obtained by EBSD analysis for the annealed LSGM deposit prepared from powder A. Different colors of the microstructures and grain boundaries shown in Fig. 17(a) represent different grain growth orientations. Different color grain boundaries shown in Fig. 17(b) represent different phases. Both the orientation and phase distribution maps showed a lamellar structure because the deposition was carried out in a layer-by-layer manner. The orientation map indicated that the grains of the deposit have no preferred orientations. The phase distribution map revealed that the deposit contains LSGM and LaSrGaO4, being consistent with the XRD analysis. Moreover, most of the LaSrGaO4 showed a lamellar structure and smaller grains than the LSGM phase. Wioletta K.-K. et al.41 also reported that the impurity phase of LaSrGaO4 was observed in the samples after vaporization measurements. LaSrGaO4 shows a tetragonal structure (PDF 24-1208) with a very low conductivity. LaSrGaO4 usually appeared in the LSGM powder preparation13 and electrolyte sintering processes,48 the evolution of which results in significant performance degradation of the resultant cell.

3.6Microstructural development of plasma sprayed LSGM
3.6.1Microstructural evolutions
The main purpose of this study was to prepare an LSGM electrolyte with a dense microstructure and high conductivity by APS. The essential issue is how to design and optimize the structure of a deposit. Based on the results mentioned above, strategically, it can be achieved by optimizing the parameters and powders. Fig. 18 shows the schematic diagram of the microstructural developments of plasma-spraying of the LSGM electrolyte by a different route. Fig. 18(a) shows the plasma spraying of the LSGM electrolyte by the LSGM powder with a wide range of particle size distribution, especially containing a substantial amount of small particles, and without deposition temperature control (i.e., preheating). Many defects are present in LSGM deposits. First, the mean bonding ratio was only ∼30 to 35% because the deposit grows with a lamellar structure. Moreover, a low deposition temperature results in many intra-splat cracks and closed pores (6–8%). As mentioned above, significant Ga evaporation from small particles will lead to the formation of nonstoichiometric regions and impurity phase. Fig. 18(b) shows the schematic microstructure of LSGM deposited with a wide range of particle size distribution but with deposition temperature control. According to the discussion in Section 3.2, the lamellar bonding ratio of the deposit increases significantly due to the higher deposition temperature than the critical one (Fig. 18(b)). Moreover, the intra-splat cracks disappear, and the porosity decreases to a low level. However, the secondary phase of LaSrGaO4 resulting from the Ga-deficient particles, which experience significant Ga evaporation loss due to the small particle size, is included in the dense deposit. Since based on the Ga evaporation mechanism, the inclusion of the secondary phase of LaSrGaO4 can be avoided using the LSGM powders of a larger size, Fig. 18(c) shows schematically the optimized microstructure of the LSGM electrolyte developed by controlling the powder particle size and deposition temperature. Thus, the LSGM electrolyte contains no LaSrGaO4 phase by limiting Ga evaporation and well bonded lamellae, although a few non-bonded interfaces and closed pores are present in the electrolyte, which are inevitable in a spraying process.

3.6.2Thermal conductivity of the plasma-sprayed LSGM deposit
To compare the properties of the deposits with those of the bulk, dense LSGM bulk samples were prepared. Fig. 19(a) shows the morphology of a fractured cross-section of the well-sintered LSGM bulk sample, which has a dense structure with large-size grains because of the high sintering temperature and long sintering time. Fig. 19(b) shows the thermal conductivity of the LSGM bulk sample and the APS deposits at different temperatures. Clearly, the thermal conductivity increased with the increase of the test temperature. For the sintered bulk sample, the thermal conductivity is ∼1.5 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature and ∼2.1 W m−1 K−1 at 1000 °C. The thermal conductivities of the APS deposits prepared from powders A and B are ∼1.25 and ∼1.24 W m−1 K−1, respectively, at room temperature and increase to ∼1.68 and ∼1.76 W m−1 K−1 at 1000 °C, respectively. The thermal conductivities of the APS deposits prepared from powders A and B are very close, and are higher than 80% of the bulk value. For thermal-sprayed ceramic coatings, the microstructure of the deposit significantly affects its thermal conductivity. Previous studies have shown that the limited bonding at the lamellar interfaces in ceramic coatings reduces the thermal conductivity. For example, the thermal conductivity of conventional plasma-sprayed Al2O3 coatings was only ∼10% of the bulk value45 because of the limited lamellar interface bonding ratio. Therefore, thermal conductivity can reflect the interface bonding ratio of the deposits. The present results revealed that the thermal conductivities of the deposits prepared from powders A and B reached &gt;80% of the bulk, suggesting that the mean interface bonding ratio of the deposits reached &gt;80%. The lamellar interface bonding ratio is significantly affected by the deposition temperature. In our previous study, the mean bonding ratio of the YSZ coatings deposited at room temperature was less than ∼32%.49 However, it reached ∼75% when the deposition temperature was increased to 1100 °C.49 The effect of deposition temperature on the interface bonding ratio is different for different materials since the critical deposition temperature for bonding temperature depends on the coating material.46,47 When the deposition temperature is higher than the critical bonding temperature, the lamellar interface bonding ratio is significantly increased with the increase of the deposition temperature.46,47 For Al2O3 coatings which have a lower critical bonding temperature of about 300 °C, the mean lamellar interface bonding ratio increased from 32% to 59% when the deposition temperature was increased from near-room temperature to 660 °C.45 Since the LSGM deposits were prepared at a deposition temperature of ∼300 to 350 °C, being higher than the critical deposition temperature, they have a high interface bonding ratio.

3.7Ionic conductivity of plasma sprayed LSGM
With a dense microstructure and high lamellar interface bonding ratio, the APS LSGM deposits may have a high ionic conductivity. Fig. 20(a), (b) and (c) show the electrochemical impedance spectra for the LSGM bulk, deposit prepared by powder A and deposit prepared by powder B at different temperatures, respectively. The deposits and sintered bulk samples exhibited different polarization resistances due to the difference in the microstructure. However, the grain interior and grain boundary contributions to the conductivity cannot be studied separately because electrode processes are dominant in the investigated frequency range and only total conductivity was obtained. Shown in Fig. 21(a) are the total ionic conductivities of the LSGM deposits and the bulk samples measured at different temperatures. The sintered bulk sample showed an ionic conductivity of ∼0.096 S cm−1 at 800 °C, consistent with the data reported in the literature.48 However, significant difference in the ionic conductivity between the two types of APS deposits was observed, even though the deposits had a similar interface bonding ratio and similar thermal conductivity. For example, at 800 °C, the ionic conductivity of the deposit prepared from powder A was 0.004 S cm−1, which is only 4.2% of the bulk conductivity in this study. However, the ionic conductivity of the deposit prepared from powder B reached 0.075 S cm−1, which is ∼78% of the bulk conductivity. The Arrhenius plots of the ionic conductivity for the LSGM bulk samples and the APS deposits are shown in Fig. 21(b). The activation energy (Ea) for the LSGM bulk sample is ∼1.02 eV, being consistent with the data in the literature.48 The deposit prepared from powder B has an Ea of ∼1.04 eV, which is very close to the Ea of the bulk sample. However, the Ea of the deposit prepared from powder A is ∼0.97 eV, which is slightly less than that of the bulk sample.

Usually, the conductivity of LSGM depends on the composition, presence of secondary phases, and ceramic microstructure. The large difference in the ionic conductivity between the two types of APS deposits can be explained by the difference in the microstructure and elemental composition. For the annealed LSGM deposit prepared from powder A, some lamellar LaSrGaO4 was observed, which is a low conducting material compared to LSGM; also, Ga-deficient splats are present in the deposit (being perpendicular to the direction of oxygen-ion transport), leading to lower ionic conductivity. For the plasma-sprayed LSGM electrolyte membrane, oxygen ion transport through the electrolyte deposits is in a direction perpendicular to the lamellae in the deposit. The existence of very low conductivity regions with a lamellar structure and non-bonded interfaces would cut off many of the direct ion transport pathways. Therefore, the ionic conductivity of the deposit would decrease significantly due to the reduction of the effective conduction area and pathways. Moreover, small closed pores would also decrease the effective conduction area. However, the effects of closed pores on the conductivity are insignificant because the pores are small and the porosity is small. In the same manner, as shown in Fig. 18(c), only some closed pores and non-bonded interfaces were observed in the deposit prepared from powder B. At 800 °C, a conductivity of 0.075 S cm−1 was obtained, which is ∼78% of the bulk conductivity. The ratios of ionic and thermal conductivities of the deposits to those of the corresponding bulk sample are very close, suggesting that the ionic conductivity of the deposit prepared from powder B is affected mainly by the non-bonded interfaces and closed pores.
Table 3 summarizes the conductivities of the LSGM electrolytes prepared by APS and solid-phase sintering (SPS) as reported in the literature. Clearly, the LSGM electrolytes prepared by APS with different powders and different parameters showed a large difference in conductivity. As mentioned above, the powder size significantly affected the conductivity because of Ga evaporation, which was clarified in this study. Moreover, the conductivity of the LSGM electrolyte prepared by SPS also showed a large difference in different studies because of the difference in the starting powders and sintering processes. The conductivity of the optimized LSGM electrolyte in this study reached 0.075 S cm−1 at 800 °C and exceeded the values of the SPS LSGMs reported,48,50,51 indicating the promising potential of APS in the fabrication of the LSGM electrolyte membrane.

Fig. 22(a) shows a cross-sectional view of a SOFC single cell supported by a NiO/YSZ anode. The GDC interlayer on the anode has a thickness of ∼2 to 3 μm. The two types of LSGM electrolyte membranes deposited on the GDC have a thickness of ∼50 to 55 μm. The electrolytes adhered well to the GDC. The thickness of the LSCF cathodes deposited on the electrolyte are ∼20 to 30 μm. The two types of cells with electrolyte membranes prepared from both powder A and B are referred to as cell A and B, respectively. Fig. 22(b) shows the microstructure of the plasma-sprayed LSCF cathode and the interface of LSGM/LSCF. The plasma-sprayed LSCF cathode showed a porous structure because most LSCF particles were in the semi-molten state during spraying. Moreover, the cathode was bonded well with the electrolyte. Therefore, a well bonded interface and the porous cathode with fine particles would provide more three-phase boundaries (TPBs) for cathode reaction.

The power outputs of the cells are shown in Fig. 23. The cells showed open-circuit voltages (OCV) of ∼1.1 V at 800 °C. This value is close to the theoretical voltage, indicating that the plasma-sprayed LSGM electrolytes are dense enough. At an operating temperature of 600 °C, cell A (Fig. 23(a)) showed a peak power density of only 13 mW cm−2. When the operating temperature was increased to 650, 700, 750, and 800 °C, the peak power densities of the cell increased to 19, 35, 60, and 95 mW cm−2, respectively. However, when the cell was assembled using the optimized electrolyte membrane through microstructure development, the cell performance enhanced significantly (Fig. 23(b)). At 600 °C, cell B showed a peak power density of 85 mW cm−2, which is much higher than that of cell A. When cell B was operated at 650, 700, 750, and 800 °C, the peak power densities reached 160, 290, 502, and 712 mW cm−2, respectively. At 800 °C, the power density of cell B was 7.5 times higher than that of cell A.

Fig. 23(c) shows the impedance spectra of the cells obtained at 800 °C under OCV conditions. The ohmic resistance can be estimated from these spectra from the intercepts with the abscissa at high frequencies. The electrode polarization losses can be obtained from the difference in intercepts with abscissa at low and high frequencies. At 800 °C, the ohmic resistances for cells A and B were 1.4 and 0.1 Ω cm2, respectively. Because the electrical conductivity of the anode and cathode are a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the electrolyte, the ohmic losses arise mainly from the LSGM electrolyte and GDC interlayer. The GDC interlayer only had a thickness of 2–3 μm; these values are consistent with the ohmic resistance of 55 μm thickness LSGM electrolytes used in this study. The large difference in the ohmic resistance for the two types of cells can be attributed to the difference in the conductivity of plasma-sprayed LSGM electrolytes. However, a significant difference in the electrode polarization (non-ohmic resistance) of the cells was also observed, even when the cells were assembled with the same anode and cathode. At 800 °C, the electrode polarization for cell A and cell B was 1.6 and 0.3 Ω cm2, respectively, which is a combination of anode and cathode impedances. Because the composite anodes were adhered on the GDC interlayer, the anodes for the two types of cells should be similar. However, the LSCF cathodes were adhered on different LSGM electrolyte membranes. Therefore, the difference between the electrode polarizations may be attributed mainly to the difference in TPBs of the cathodes. The TPBs of the cathode were composed of LSGM, LSCF, and oxygen gas. As shown in Fig. 24(a), the electrolyte prepared from powder A had an impurity phase of LaSrGaO4 and the Ga-deficient regions showed very low ionic conductivity. Because of the existence of these regions, the effective surface area of the electrolyte decreased, thus subsequently decreasing the activity of the TPBs. However, the less conductive phases did not exist in the optimized electrolyte, which would provide more TPBs for the cathode reaction (Fig. 24(b)). Therefore, the cathodic polarization resistance of cell A was much higher than that of cell B.

Hwang et al. reported that the LSGM electrolyte prepared by APS showed a conductivity of ∼0.05 S cm−1 at 800 °C.32 The LSGM powder had a d50 particle size of ∼37 μm, which was larger than that of powder A and smaller than that of powder B used in this study. Therefore, Ga evaporation might have occurred in the smaller particles during the spraying process. That is why the ionic conductivity is lower than that obtained in the present study for the deposit prepared using powder B. In their study, the cell assembled with the Ni/YSZ anode, plasma-sprayed LSGM electrolyte (50–60 μm), and LSCF cathode (20–30 μm), which was similar to our study, showed a peak power density of ∼440 mW cm−2 at 800 °C (H2 and O2 were used as the fuel and oxygen source, respectively). Taking into account the test condition by H2/air in the present study, this value reported previously is much lower than that obtained in the present study for cell B possibly due to the lower conductivity of the electrolyte. Ma et al. also studied the performance of the plasma-sprayed LSGM electrolyte. In their study, LSGM powder with a size distribution of d50 ∼ 40 μm was used. The plasma-sprayed LSGM electrolyte showed a conductivity of ∼0.085 S cm−1 at 800 °C.33 Even though the electrolyte showed a superior conductivity, the cell assembled with the Ni/YSZ anode, LSGM electrolyte, and La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (LSM) cathode showed a peak power density of ∼150 mW cm−2 at 800 °C, which was much lower than that obtained in the present study because the LSM cathode showed a low catalytic activity at 800 °C. Joo et al. reported that the cell assembled with 20 μm LSGM electrolyte, which was prepared by the slurry coating method, showed a peak power density of 930 mW cm−2 at 700 °C.18 It means that the cell performance can be further improved by decreasing the electrolyte thickness. However, the cell in their study had a very small active electrode area (diameter of only ∼2 mm) and it is difficult to scale up to large cells.
The performance of the cells assembled from plasma-sprayed LSGM electrolyte membranes may be further enhanced by the following approaches. First, the conductivity of the plasma-sprayed LSGM electrolyte may be improved further to a value close to 100% of the bulk value by decreasing the non-bonded interfaces and porosity. For example, the deposition temperature can be increased, and dense spherical particles with a particle size larger than 30 μm may be used. Then, the thickness of the electrolyte can be decreased to 20–30 μm. Finally, since the electrode polarization resistance of cell B was ∼0.3 Ω cm2, the cell performance may be further improved by enhancing the electrode performance. For example, a composite cathode may provide more TPBs for the cathode reactions.
