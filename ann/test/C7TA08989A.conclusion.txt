Conclusions
In summary the electrical and structural properties of the novel oxide ion conductor Ba3WNbO8.5 have been elucidated. W6+ is more stable than Mo6+ under reducing conditions so that replacing W6+ for Mo6+ reduces the electronic component in low pO2. This is similar to tungsten doping studies of LAMOX where the presence of W6+ leads to an increase in the stability range for La2Mo0.5W1.5O9 at 800 °C.33
In Ba3MNbO8.5 (M = Mo, W) the ionic migration is thought to proceed via tetrahedral and octahedral interchange occurring through a cooperative interstitialcy-like motion of the oxygen atoms between the occupied and vacant oxygen sites within the pseudo-cubic BaO2.5 layers. At 20 °C in Ba3WNbO8.5, the O(3) site presents a much lower fractional occupancy than observed for Ba3MoNbO8.5 thus reducing the concentration of charge carriers, resulting in a bulk oxide ionic conductivity an order of magnitude lower than that reported for Ba3MoNbO8.5 at 450 °C. Upon heating to 600 °C the bulk conductivities of Ba3MoNbO8.5 and Ba3WNbO8.5 converge. Given that the ionic conductivity has been shown to be sensitive to the ratio of (M/Nb)O4 tetrahedra to (M/Nb)O6 tetrahedra,19,26 it's highly likely that the crystal structure of Ba3MNbO8.5 hexagonal perovskite derivatives rearranges to an optimal ratio of tetrahedra : octahedra upon heating. Finally the results demonstrate that oxide ion conductivity can be established in other members of the Ba3MM′O8.5 family and the synthesis of new materials where M = a hexavalent cation and M′ = a pentavalent cation could result in new materials with applications as SOFC electrolytes, oxygen sensors and/or oxygen separation membranes.
