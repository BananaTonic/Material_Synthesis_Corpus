Conclusions
In this work we studied Li9S3N, with and without substituents, as a potential anode barrier layer for all solid-state batteries. LSN is attractive since our results show it is stable against lithium metal. LSN was synthesized and shows an ionic conductivity of 8.3 × 10−7 S cm−1 at room temperature with an activation energy of 0.52 eV, in excellent agreement with NEB and AIMD calculations. We explored the possibility of improving conductivity through aliovalent substitution.  substitution was found to have a low incorporation energy, and marginally improves conductivity.  substitution to a concentration of Li8.5Ca0.25S3N leads to a very high percolated conductivity, but at a cost of high incorporation energy. LSN has the potential to be a cheap anode barrier layer for use in all solid state batteries.
