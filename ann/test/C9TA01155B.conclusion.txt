Conclusions
In conclusion, we presented a novel all-in-gel design for all-solid-state energy storage devices by employing ionogel composite electrolytes and bucky gel electrodes that possess enhanced mechanical strength and ionic conductivity. These ionogel composites can act both as integrated electrolyte and separator, which overcomes some of the typical contact issues found across electrode/electrolyte interfaces by facilitating an intimate and mechanically resilient contact. As a result, all-solid-state supercapacitors fabricated through the seamless integration of an EMIMBF4-based ionogel electrolyte/separator with EMIMBF4-based bucky electrodes have been shown to offer ionic conductivities up to 8.7 mS cm−1, resulting in high capacitance of 41 mF cm−2 at 10 mV s−1. Furthermore, they allow for a wide operating temperature range of (−40 °C to 100 °C) with capacitances of 22–81 mF cm−2 and are stable up to 300 °C. They also demonstrated excellent mechanical robustness, with 78% self-recoverable after 300 cycles at a high strain of 60%. These soft, flexible, shape-conformable and easy-to-manufacture all-in-gel materials represent a step change in the design of safe energy storage devices for wearable electronics, in particular those facing the increased demands of hazardous operational environments.
