Conclusions
This research study has shown a new strategy that combines the concepts of molecular assembly and disassembly for investigating the proton conductivity; first, in an immobilized system where the molecules were self-organized as evidenced by X-ray analysis, and second, in an isotropic phase where the molecules were free to move. Proton conductors with a low density of insulating alkyl chains have shown a higher proton conductivity of up to 8 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 140 °C. The activation energy (0.09–2.11 eV) has indicated that the conduction was driven by the hopping of the protons from one site to another. Further, due to their ability to withstand a higher temperature up to 190 °C without any degradation, organophosphonates presented here would further open the door for developing new proton conducting membranes in which ionic molecules with reversible self-assembly can operate both at low and high temperature, and thereby can be promising polyelectrolytes for fuel cell applications. Obviously, the weak mechanical properties of small ionic molecules do not generally allow stable film formation. A system comprising these phosphonated molecules and a suitable polymer matrix can be envisioned to reapply our approach and to integrate the system into a fuel cell device. Nevertheless, these organic phosphonated molecules decorated with lyophilic hydrocarbon chains can also withstand any threat of washing out during operation due to their insolubility in water. A further aim and extension of this work will be the identification and choice of an appropriate polymer film to interpenetrate these proton conductors into the polymer matrix that can be directly integrated into a device.
