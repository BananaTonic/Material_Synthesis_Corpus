Experimental
Preparation of Te-PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite solutions
Te-PEDOT:PSS was synthesized based on previously described procedures.4 Sodium telluride (Na2TeO3, Aldrich, USA) was used as the tellurium source. First, 0.99 g of ascorbic acid (Aldrich, USA) was dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water, and 1 mL of a PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH 1000, Heraeus, Germany) solution was filtered through a PVDF syringe filter (0.45 μm) and added to this solution. Subsequently, 0.07 g of Na2TeO3 was added to the mixture under stirring. The temperature of the mixture was then increased to 90 °C and maintained for 20 h. Pure Te-PEDOT:PSS nanorods were collected by centrifugation of the reaction mixture at 9000 rpm for 10 min; the process was repeated at least three times. The final product was re-suspended in 5 mL of pure deionized water.
Preparation of nanocarbon solutions
To prepare the GNP solutions, 0.025 g of GNP powder (N002-PDR, x, y &lt; 10 μm, average thickness &lt;1 nm, Angstron Materials, USA) was dispersed in 50 mL of deionized water, with 0.125 mL of a poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid) (PSS) (Aldrich, USA) solution used as a surfactant. The dispersion was then stabilized using a horn sonicator for 90 min. To prepare the SSWNT solutions, 0.025 g of SSWNTs (EC 2.0, diameter: 2 ± 0.5 nm, Meijo Nano Carbon, Japan) was dispersed in 200 mL of isopropyl alcohol (Honeywell, USA) with 0.125 mL of the PSS solution. The dispersion was then stabilized using a horn sonicator for 3 h.
Preparation of nanocarbon-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite films
To prepare nanocarbon-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS solutions, the Te-PEDOT:PSS solutions were mixed with each nanocarbon solution of various mixing concentrations. The mixed solutions were stabilized using a bath sonicator for 30 min. The nanocarbon-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS solutions were then deposited on a glass substrate (20 mm × 20 mm) using the spray printing method at 120 °C to remove the residual solvent. Finally, approximately 2–3 μm-thick nanocarbon-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS films were formed.
Fabrication of thermoelectric generators
To fabricate the TEGs, thermoelectric legs were sprayed on a glass or PAR substrate using the nanocarbon-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS solutions with a shadow mask. Each nanocarbon-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS solution was sprayed by using a commercially available spray gun (Plus HP-SB Plus, Iwata, Japan) with a nozzle diameter of 0.2 mm. For connection of the printed thermoelectric legs, metal electrodes were dispensed using conductive silver paste (NB05, Soulbrain, Korea). The silver paste was dispensed through a 200 μm nozzle (SHOTMAATER 200 DS-S, Musashi Engineering, Inc., Japan). The printed TEGs were then annealed at 150 °C on a hotplate for 30 min.
Instrumentation
The nanostructure of the nanocarbon-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS was observed via TEM (Tecnai G2, FEI, USA) analysis. The TEM samples were prepared by microtoming the Te-PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite film. The surface morphology of the nanocarbon-mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS was investigated using SEM (XL30S FEG, Philips, Netherlands) and atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope System Co., Korea) in an area of 3 μm2 in noncontact mode. Before analysis of the films, platinum films with a thickness of approximately 100 nm were deposited on the prepared films with a coating machine (E-1030, Hitachi Ltd, Japan). XRD (D/MAX-2200V, Rigaku Co., Japan) patterns were used to identify the crystal structures of films of the Te-PEDOT:PSS nanocomposites, nanocarbon, and mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS. The XRD measurements were performed using the thin-film diffraction technique, in which the sample was fixed at a low angle of 3° to the X-ray beam during the 2θ scan of the detector. The source power was 40 mA/40 kV. The thickness of the films was determined by using an alpha-step surface profiler (α-step IQ, KLA Tencor, USA). A Raman spectroscope (SENTERRA, Bruker, Germany) was used to identify the Raman shift of the Te-PEDOT:PSS nanocomposite, nanocarbon, and mixed Te-PEDOT:PSS. The electrical conductivity was measured via the four-point probe method by using a combination of a current source (220, Keithley, USA) and a digital multimeter (195A, Keithley, USA). The Seebeck coefficient was measured by using the sample with silver electrodes with a home-built setup at a humidity of 18%. Two silver electrodes, 3 mm in width, were separated by a distance of 30 mm. The temperature gradient between the two electrodes was varied from 1 to 10 °C. The setup consisted of two Peltier devices to maintain controlled stages that could independently function as the hot part or the cold part. A Keithley 2460 sourcemeter, a Keithley 2700 multimeter/data acquisition system, a Keithley 2182A nanovoltmeter, and a Keithley 2200-30-5 power supply were used for the measurements.
