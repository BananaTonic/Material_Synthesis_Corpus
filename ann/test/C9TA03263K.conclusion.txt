Conclusion
An SSE with high Li+ conductivity and stability is critical for the application development of all solid-state batteries. In summary, herein, a grain boundary structure with low interfacial resistance was constructed to attain an excellent SSE. The XRD and NPD results revealed that the Ta atom occupied the position of Zr, and the B atom did not enter the LLZO lattice. From the cross-sectional SEM and the high-resolution TEM images, it was observed that after the addition of LBO, the pellet of LLZTO became denser, and its grain boundaries were consolidated by an amorphous boracic phase, which made the grains firmly connect together. It was demonstrated that the LLZTO/LBO electrolyte showed a high Li+ conductivity with the value of 5.74 × 10−4 S cm−1. Moreover, the Li-LLZTO/LBO–LFP + NCM hybrid solid battery exhibited a good electrochemical performance with the reversible capacity of 147.8 mA h g−1 at 0.2C after 100 cycles. The capacity was still over 100 mA h g−1 at 1C. The consolidated grain boundary structure proposed herein offers an effective way to elevate the SSE for high-electrochemical performance solid-state batteries.
