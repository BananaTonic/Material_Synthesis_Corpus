Conclusions
We have successfully integrated two effective strategies to improve the PCE of BHJ i-SMSCs with the active layer p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:PC71BM by doping the ZnO cathode with a fullerene derivative (ZnO–C60) and introducing SAM modification on its surface in contact with the active layer. Such ZnO–C60 gives a fullerene-derivative-rich interface in contact with the active layer and enhances the surface conductivity and bulk electron mobility relative to pristine ZnO. The resulting device with the cathode ZnO–C60 gives a PCE of 8.3% higher than that with ZnO 6.08% by about 2%. Further incorporation of the SAM (NPC70-OH) on top of ZnO–C60 leads to further promotion of the PCE to 9.14% by 0.84%, resulting from reduced electron/hole recombination and therefore more effective electron collection.
