Synthesis of the 4,8-disulfonaphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H4SNDC) linker
A mixture of H2NDC (1 g, 4.63 mmol) and 5 mL of oleum (SO3 in H2SO4, 50 wt%) was added to a 50 mL flask bottle and continuously stirred at 150 °C for 1 day. Then, fresh oleum (3 mL) was introduced and stirred at 170 °C for 2 days. Finally, fresh oleum (2 mL) was added and stirred at 190 °C for 1 day. Subsequently, the reaction was cooled to room temperature and the product was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water, filtered, and precipitated with 50 mL of concentrated HCl (37 wt%). This precipitated product was then filtered and washed with excess amounts (100 mL) of concentrated HCl and dried under vacuum at 150 °C to obtain a pure H4SNDC linker in 70% yield (1.2 g, 3.2 mmol). 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, 500 Hz): δ = 9.59 (s, 2H) and 8.49 (s, 2H) (see ESI, Fig. S1). FT-IR: 3105 (m); 2648 (w); 2547 (w); 1691 (s); 1604 (m); 1485 (w); 1425 (s); 1374 (m); 1325 (w); 1286 (s); 1238 (s); 1189 (s); 1145 (s); 1109 (s); 1019 (s); 914 (s); 804 (s); 768 (s); 734 (s); 653 (m); and 634 (m).
Synthesis of pristine VNU-23
A mixture of H4SNDC (0.033 g, 0.088 mmol) and ZrOCl2·8H2O (0.026 g, 0.081 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (4 mL), followed by the addition of formic acid (1 mL). The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 72 h, to obtain colourless microcrystals, which were exchanged with DMF for 3 days (3 × 5 mL). Subsequently, this material was exchanged with CH2Cl2 (3 × 5 mL), dried and activated under vacuum (10−3 Torr) at room temperature to yield a pristine VNU-23 sample (80% yield based on Zr4+). EA (activated sample): calcd for Zr6C64H141.9O78.93S8N8 = [Zr6O8(H2O)8(SNDC)4]·(DMA)8·22.93H2O (DMA = dimethylammonium): C, 24.83; H, 4.59; N, 3.62; and S, 8.27%. Found: C, 25.25; H, 4.01; N, 3.27; and S, 7.7%.

Synthesis of VNU-23
Pristine VNU-23 was exchanged with a MeOH/H2O solution of H2SO4 for 2 days (0.3 M H2SO4, vMeOH/vH2O = 4/1 mL mL−1, 5 × 5 mL). Thereafter, this sample was centrifuged and washed with copious amounts of MeOH/H2O (5 × 5 mL; vMeOH/vH2O = 4/1 mL mL−1) until the decanted liquor reached pH = 5. Subsequently, this material was washed with MeOH (5 × 5 mL), dried and activated under dynamic vacuum (10−3 Torr) at room temperature to acquire VNU-23. 1H-NMR (digested VNU-23, DMSO-d6, 500 Hz): δ = 9.59 (s, 2H) and 8.49 (s, 2H) (see ESI, Fig. S12).

Synthesis of His8.2⊂VNU-23
120 mg of VNU-23 was added to 10 mL of a MeOH solution of histamine (His, 0.5 M). The mixture was shaken at 45 °C for 3 days, cooled to room temperature, and then centrifuged and washed with a mixture of MeOH and CH2Cl2 (3 × 2 mL; vMeOH/vCH2Cl2 = 1/19 mL mL−1) to remove histamine within the intercrystalline regions. Thereafter, the sample was activated overnight under dynamic vacuum (10−3 Torr) at room temperature to obtain His8.2⊂VNU-23.
