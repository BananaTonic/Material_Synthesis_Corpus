Experimental
Membrane preparation
PVDF (Mw = 534 000, Aldrich) was mixed with a certain ratio of PVP (Mn = 360 000, IPS Technologies) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, reagent grade, Aldrich) and stirred for 2 days at room temperature (RT) to obtain a uniform polymer solution. The total polymer concentration was controlled to be 10–15 wt%. Then the resulting polymer solution was cast on a flat framed glass substrate and then dried in an oven at 80 °C for 48 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the PVDF–PVP blend membranes were peeled off from the glass substrate. The thickness of the obtained membrane was controlled to be about 120 ± 5 μm.
Membrane characterization
The morphology of the composite membranes was recorded on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector (Camscan 3400, Oxford Instruments) at 20 kV accelerating voltage. To view the cross-section of the membrane, all samples were ruptured in liquid nitrogen, followed by the sputtering of gold on the cross-section and surface of the membranes. The molecular structure of the PVDF–PVP blends was examined by FTIR (iN10MX) in reflection mode. The thermal stability of the membranes was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Shimadzu TGA-50, Japan). A sample weighing 10 mg was tested over temperatures ranging from RT to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen (99.99%) atmosphere. The stability of the blended PVDF–PVP membranes was also tested in pure water and in Fenton reagent solution (a 3 wt% H2O2 aqueous solution containing 3 ppm FeSO4)30 at 80 °C.
PA doping
The PA doping level and the volume expansion measurements of the composite membrane were carried out in triplicate independently with different pieces of membranes to examine the reproducibility. Composited membranes were immersed into 85% PA solution at ambient temperature for 24 h, and then wiped with filter papers. The weight was calculated based on the difference of the membrane after and before the PA doping treatment. The PA doping level is defined as the amount of PA absorbed by the monomer unit of PVP. The formula is listed below:WA and WB are the membrane weight after and before the PA doping treatment. α is the content of PVP in the composite membrane. For each PA doping level reported, at least four samples were measured and results were taken as the average.
Proton conductivity
The through-plane proton conductivity of the membrane samples was measured in a single cell arrangement via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy over a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1000 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV using an IviumStat electrochemical workstation. The membranes were sandwiched into membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), and the measurements were carried out under dry H2 and O2 in a temperature range from 90 °C to 200 °C. Three different samples were used for the measurement and the conductivity values were taken as the average.
Single cell test
The PVDF–PVP composite membranes were used to fabricate MEAs. Pt/C with a Pt loading of 0.5 mg cm−2 was used for both anode and cathode. Catalyst inks were prepared by blending Pt/C powders and PVP solution (5 wt%, ethanol) under ultrasonic vibration. And then the catalyst ink was brushed onto a microporous gas diffusion layer (GDL) to prepare the electrodes, and dried at 45 °C. The membrane was sandwiched between two electrodes to obtain MEA with hot pressing. The performances of single fuel cells were tested in a temperature range of 70–180 °C by a fuel cell testing station G20 (Greenlight, Canada). Dry H2 and O2 were input with a flow rate of 150 mL min−1.
