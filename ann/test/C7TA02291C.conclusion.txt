Conclusions
A PDMP-Li GPE consisted of 1 M LiPF6 EC/DEC (1 : 1 in volume) and PDMAPMA gel was synthesized successfully by a one-step method with γ-radiation induced polymerization and crosslinking. The resultant PDMP-Li GPE exhibited high ionic conductivity around 8.88 × 10−3 S cm−1, good thermal stability, excellent mechanical integrity and strength to allow the safe operation in lithium-ion batteries. After 50 cycles, the assembled LiFePO4/PDMP-Li GPE/graphite pouch-type cell showed a very stable discharge behavior and little capacity loss under current constant voltage conditions, at a rate of 0.1C and 25 °C. Considering these results, the cell with the PDMP-Li GPE appears to be a promising candidate for lithium-ion batteries.
