Conclusions
In this study, the effect of an applied electric field on the ion exchange membrane was investigated based on the structure and performance of the Nafion membranes. First, the structural changes in the electrically modified membrane were observed by TEM. These changes include the reduction in size and increased number of ion clusters. Even though the ion channels are weakly aligned owing to the complex structure of Nafion, this alignment contributes to an increase in the ion conductivity. In addition, an increase in the crystallinity in the electrically treated membrane was identified using XRD analysis, in which the crystallinity was found to be enhanced from 37% to 44%. Further evidence of increased structural order in the aligned membrane was found in the FT-IR spectra, where peak intensities of characteristic functional groups were increased. The structural changes increased the proton conductivity of Nafion, as confirmed by conductivity measurements. In other words, an ordered structure and smaller ion clusters were induced by the application of an electric field during casting, thus modifying the Nafion membrane and increasing its proton conductivity by 2â€“3 times that of the pristine membrane. In this study, changes of the morphological structure and conductivities of electrically aligned Nafion were mainly investigated using the parameters. However, we will apply it in energy conversion systems such as PEMFC and RFB to demonstrate the improved performance as a further work.
