Conclusions
In summary, tunnel-type Na0.44MnO2 is modified with a Na2MoO4 coating layer via melt impregnation. Spontaneous transformation from (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O to Na2MoO4 upon heating to 350 °C reduces the residual sodium content on the surface of the active materials. The Na2MoO4-coated Na0.44MnO2 exhibits improved charge–discharge capacity with multiple functionalities of the Na2MoO4 coating layer that play the pivotal roles of scavenging HF and protecting the surface of the active materials by forming fluorinated MoO3−xF2x layers against HF attack. The lower HF level in the electrolyte delays the particle and structural degradation of the Na2MoO4-coated Na0.44MnO2. As a result, the Na2MoO4-coated Na0.44MnO2 exhibits excellent cyclability and high-rate performance, with ∼100% capacity retention up to 1000 cycles even at 60C (7.2 A g−1). These synergetic effects of the Na2MoO4 surface coating may be beneficial for the development of commercial SIBs, and the use of similar coating technologies may be extended to various cathode materials for SIBs.
