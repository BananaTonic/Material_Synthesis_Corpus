Results and discussion
Synthesis
Ln1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ (Ln = Eu, Gd and Tb) glasses were prepared using aerodynamic levitation coupled to a laser heating system. These three lanthanide compositions (Eu, Gd and Tb) were chosen given both their glass making ability21 (only Ln = Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Y compositions can form glass) and their large ionic radius close to Sr2+ (r(Sr2+) = 1.260 Å &gt; r(Eu3+) = 1.066 Å &gt; r(Gd3+) = 1.053 Å &gt; r(Tb3+) = 1.040 Å, in the VIII coordination state).39 Thus, large Sr for Ln substitution levels (up to x = 0.6) could be achieved, which is a key point for high ionic conductivity in melilite ceramics.25 Samples with different substitution levels have been synthesized and the maximum substitution values (x) which could be prepared as a glass were 0.6 for Eu and Gd and 0.4 for Tb. Beyond these compositions, the glass could not be formed as crystallization systematically occurred during cooling from the melt. The resulting glasses are transparent (inset Fig. 1) and only the gadolinium composition is colorless, due to the presence of absorption bands in the Eu and Tb compositions. Thermal analyses were performed on these highly substituted glasses (Fig. 1). The glass transition occurred at around 760 °C, followed by a single crystallization peak at 790 °C. The presence of a single peak and no further exothermic peak at higher temperature seems to indicate a congruent crystallization process which is required to eventually elaborate a dense and single phase melilite ceramic.
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements of the Ln1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ (Ln = Eu, Gd and Tb) glass composition. Tg and Tx correspond to glass transition and crystallization temperatures respectively at the peak onset. Photographs show Ln1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ (Ln = Eu, Gd and Tb) glasses (on the left) and the corresponding polycrystalline ceramics elaborated by full crystallization from glass at 720 °C for 2 h (on the right).
In order to confirm this congruent crystallization process, in situ X-ray diffraction studies were carried out, as exemplified for the Gd0.6Sr0.4Ga3O7+δ glass composition, from room temperature up to 820 °C by acquiring diffractograms every 10 °C (10 min per diffractogram). Fig. S2 reveals that only the melilite phase crystallizes from 770 °C and no other crystalline phase was formed between the glass transition and the melilite crystallization temperatures. A thermal treatment at a temperature lower than Tx was then chosen to synthesize a fully crystallized melilite material, i.e. a ceramic, in a single step. After two hours of heat treatment at 720 °C in a classical open air furnace, strong crystallization has occurred, as observed on the diffractograms presented in Fig. 2 (the full crystallization, i.e. the ceramic state, will be demonstrated later in the manuscript by electron microscopy). Glass crystallization below Tg is uncommon as crystallization heat treatments are usually ranging from Tg to Tx in glass-ceramic technology. However this phenomenon is not new and has been previously observed.29,40 In fact these glasses exhibit a very low Hrüby factor (KH)34 which indicates a low stability against crystallization. Moreover, these glass compositions show a congruent crystallization process; therefore, almost no atomic diffusion is required to induce crystallization which can occur below Tg (i.e. at high viscosity). As expected, the diffractograms of the three crystalline compositions (Eu1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7+δ, Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7+δ and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7+δ) match the standard pattern of the tetragonal melilite phase (ICDD PDF 73-6102). No secondary crystalline phase was visible, confirming a congruent glass crystallization process. Moreover, these materials exhibit transparency (inset Fig. 1), although some light scattering can be observed, as expected from the birefringent melilite structure. The transparency indicates that the ceramics must contain very limited porosity, as even a very low amount of porosity (0.1%) is known to be sufficient to lead to an opaque material.41,42

Structure determination
According to the nominal Ln1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ cationic non-stoichiometry, extra oxygens (δ) are required to obey the structure electroneutrality (considering that the Eu, Gd and Tb lanthanides exhibit an oxidation state of &gt;2). Therefore, in order to understand the ionic conductivity properties, it is essential to determine the position and the occupancy of these extra oxygen crystallographic sites.
First, a XANES study was carried out on both Eu1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7+δ and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7+δ materials to determine the oxidation state of Eu and Tb respectively and to further deduce the oxygen content in these compositions (Fig. 3). The two spectra presented in Fig. 3a and c correspond to the EuTiO3 and Tb4O7 references (mixed oxidation state compositions). The EuTiO3 spectrum exhibits two peaks centered at 6974 eV and 6982 eV corresponding to Eu2+ and Eu3+ respectively. In the same manner, the Tb4O7 spectrum exhibits two peaks at 7516 eV and 7524 eV related to the presence of Tb3+ and Tb4+ respectively. These two reference spectra can be fitted with two Lorentzian functions (blue and green) centered on the absorption edge energy of each valence state and one arctangent (pink) showing the jump observed during the excitation edge transition. Fig. 3b and d correspond to the spectra acquired for the Eu1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7+δ and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7+δ ceramics respectively. Neither Eu2+ nor Tb4+ can be detected on the spectra, as no peak corresponding to Eu2+ (at 6974 eV)43 and Tb4+ (at 7524 eV)44 could be observed. Even though the presence of a few percent of different oxidation states (Tb4+ or Eu2+) cannot be excluded (below the detection limit), we will consider further that only Eu3+ and Tb3+ are present in the Eu1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7+δ and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7+δ ceramics. The oxygen contents can therefore be determined as Eu1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3 and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2. It should be noted that the presence of only Eu3+ or Tb3+ in the structure is a crucial point to prevent electronic conduction arising from the coexistence of two oxidation states.45

(c and d) XANES spectra at the Tb L3 edge of (c) Tb4O7 as a reference of a mixed Tb3+ and Tb4+ oxide, and (d) the Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7+δ ceramic. Black dots correspond to the experimental points, the blue and green curves represent the Lorentzian fits of Eu2+ and Eu3+ (a and b), and Tb3+ and Tb4+ (c and d) respectively, the pink curve to the arctangent background required to obtain the fit (in red) which is the addition of the arctangent and the two Lorentzian curves.
In order to determine the structure of these non-stoichiometric melilite materials and to precisely localize the extra oxygen crystallographic sites, we then performed both synchrotron and neutron powder diffraction (SPD and NPD) experiments. The structural and microstructural characterizations presented hereafter will be focusing on the Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 ceramic composition as both Eu and Gd have excessive neutron absorptions to perform NPD studies (absorption values are 23, 4530 and 49 700 barns for Tb, Eu and Gd respectively).46
As no structural model was available for Tb-based melilite structures, the stoichiometric YSrGa3O7 (ICSD 109453, P4̄21m, a ≈ 7.93 Å and c ≈ 5.20 Å) crystalline structure was used as a starting model (considering Tb for Y substitution). This tetragonal structure is composed of (3,4)-linked Ga3O7 tetrahedral sheets stacked along the c-axis. Sr2+ and Tb3+, sharing the same crystallographic site, are randomly distributed between these sheets. A first Rietveld refinement was performed from synchrotron powder diffraction data, assuming that all the crystallographic sites were fully occupied (occupancy Sr/Tb = 0.5/0.5). This refinement leads to good reliability factors (Rwp = 9.98%, Rp = 7.91% and GOF = 1.55), thus confirming a similarity of this material to the stoichiometric melilite structure.
Regarding the cell parameters, the non-stoichiometric Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 composition shows a decrease of the cell parameters (a ≈ 7.902 Å and c ≈ 5.183 Å) compared to the TbSrGa3O7 stoichiometric melilite (Fig. S3). The same behavior is also observed for Eu and Gd compositions and is consistent with the incorporation of cations smaller than Sr2+ into the structure. It should also be noted that the cell parameters decrease to a lesser extent for Tb (x = 0.4) melilite ceramics since the substitution value is lower than for the Gd (x = 0.6) and Eu (x = 0.6) based-melilite phases.25
Rietveld refinements further led to the quantification of the terbium occupancy on the mixed Tb/Sr site. This occupancy increased from 0.5 (value corresponding to the stoichiometric TbSrGa3O7 composition) up to 0.69, which is close to the 0.7 nominal value, and contributed to improve the Rietveld refinement reliability factors (Rwp = 9.00%, Rp = 7.37% and GOF = 1.40).
Remarkably, no secondary phase could be detected by SPD for the europium and gadolinium based materials, in opposition to the usual solid state synthesis of non-stoichiometric melilite by a solid state reaction.29,30 Only the Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 material shows the presence of a side phase, the Tb3Ga5O12 garnet (Fig. S4). The small garnet diffraction peaks appear much broader than the melilite related ones, suggesting nanometer scale garnet crystallites as confirmed further in the manuscript by transmission electron microscopy. Thanks to the high statistics of the SPD data, the Tb3Ga5O12 garnet phase content could be quantified to be 1.3(1) wt%. This amount appears limited compared to the quantity of the secondary phase obtained by solid state synthesis of similar non-stoichiometric melilite materials, such as La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 (≈5 wt% of LaGaO3 perovskite).30 Moreover, regarding our Tb1+xSr1−xGa3O7+x/2 transparent melilite ceramics, it should be noted that the presence of Tb3Ga5O12 is only observed for the maximum substitution level we used (x = 0.4). No secondary phase was detected for lower substitution contents. Therefore, we postulate that the presence of Tb3Ga5O12 garnet can be explained by the nominal composition we used: Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 is most probably slightly exceeding the maximum possible substitution level which can be achieved for Tb1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ. In fact, the refined amount of Tb3Ga5O12 in Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 (1.3(1) wt% or 2.2(2) mol%) is in good agreement with the refined Sr/Tb ratio from SPD refinement if we consider this x = 0.38 value as the maximum substitution level which can be elaborated. The excess of Tb and Ga oxides resulting from a nominal composition exceeding the maximum substitution level (x = 0.38) leads to the formation of the Tb3Ga5O12 secondary phase. The observation of secondary phases is commonly reported in the literature to be an ongoing problem for non-stoichiometric melilite ceramics elaborated by solid state synthesis. Previous studies even assumed that synthesizing the La1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ single melilite crystalline phase would be impossible for compositions with x &gt; 0.05 using solid state synthesis.29,30 Nevertheless, here we show that full crystallization from glass enables the elaboration of single phase non-stoichiometric melilite ceramics and therefore appears to be an interesting method to produce pure new oxide ion conductors.
In order to localize the extra oxygen (0.2 oxygen per formula unit) required to obey the structure electroneutrality, the structural model determined by SPD was then refined versus NPD data, leading to correct reliability factors (Rwp = 6.66%, Rp = 4.87% and GOF = 4.74). Fourier difference maps obtained from this refinement present residual scattering densities in the z = 0 section. Several density residues can be observed, demonstrating the presence of disorder in this model. Nevertheless, a significant peak density can be clearly detected at x = 0.32, y = 0.18 and z = −0.03, which corresponds to a new 4e crystallographic site (Fig. 4). This scattering density was assigned to the presence of the extra oxygen (labelled O4) due to its distance with neighbor cations typical of Ga–O bond lengths in the melilite structure (Ga2–O4 is 1.85 Å). Moreover, this extra 4e oxygen position is in good agreement with the model determined for La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 and La1.64Ca0.36Ga3O7.32.25,47,48

Finally, a combined SPD and NPD refinement was carried out by constraining the O4 site occupancy to obey the structure electroneutrality. The final Tb occupancy was refined to 0.695(2). Fig. 5 presents the corresponding plots of SPD (a) and NPD (b) combined refinement while Table 1 lists the refined structural parameters for Tb1.39Sr0.61Ga3O7.195. The anisotropic displacement parameters are refined and detailed in Fig. S5, improving the final reliability factors to Rwp = 8.17%, Rp = 6.53% and GOF = 1.27 for SPD and to Rwp = 3.33%, Rp = 6.25% and GOF = 1.36 for NPD.

The O4 atoms fill almost 10% of the pentagonal tunnels formed by the GaO4 tetrahedra in order to compensate for the excess of charge due to the Tb3+ for Sr2+ substitution. As a consequence, when O4 is present (in 10% of cases), Ga2O4 tetrahedra are transformed into trigonal bipyramidal units. Ga2 is then in 5-coordination, which is rather unusual although previously reported in few structures.23,25,49

Blue spheres correspond to strontium and terbium mixed crystallographic sites, green to gallium atoms and red to oxygen atoms. The extra oxygen O4 (yellow) is located in the Ga3O7 tetrahedral layers. The O4 fills 20% of the tunnels formed by the tetrahedra (occ(O4) = 0.1). The bond lengths are indicated on the structure enlargement.
The bond lengths calculated for each cation species (Table 2) are consistent with regular Sr–O (≈2.5 Å) and Ga–O (≈1.8 Å) distances observed in the melilite structure, even for the extra O4 position (Ga2–O4 = 1.916(1) Å). The bond valence sum (BVS)50 values calculated from the different bond lengths correspond to 3.2 for Ga1 and 3.1 for Ga2, in agreement with the gallium +3 oxidation state. The Sr/Tb mixed site shows a BVS of 2.6, which is also in agreement with a mixed 1.4Tb3+/0.6Sr2+ occupancy. These results support the structural model determined from Rietveld refinement of both SPD and NPD data.

The microstructure of the new non-stoichiometric Ln1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ (Ln = Eu, Gd and Tb) transparent melilite ceramics has been studied by both SEM and TEM. All microstructures exhibit large crystalline grains (several micrometers) with very thin grain boundaries (Fig. 7a and b). Furthermore, no amorphous area could be detected, proving the complete crystallization process (no remaining glass). Moreover, no porosity could be detected either, supporting the full density of the ceramic materials. The absence of porosity in the crystalline sample can be explained by similar experimental density values of both glass and ceramic phases (Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2: ρglass = 6.16(5) g cm−3 ≈ ρceramic = 6.17(5) g cm−3) which were measured using Archimedes' method as reported in Fig. S6 (the theoretical density of crystalline Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 is ρthceramic = 6.15 g cm−3). Therefore the full density of glass can be retained during the crystallization process.

(c) Dark field TEM micrograph showing an aggregate of Tb3Ga5O12 nanoparticles (pink arrow) inside a Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 ceramic grain.
Regarding the Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 material which was proved to contain the Tb3Ga5O12 secondary phase by SPD, nanoparticle aggregates can clearly be observed within the melilite grains (pink arrow Fig. 7c). These nanoparticles present a cubic structure with a cell parameter (a = 12.47 Å, as observed by electronic diffraction) matching the broad diffraction peaks of the Tb3Ga5O12 secondary garnet phase detected by SPD (1.3(1) wt%).
Interestingly, the weak birefringence of melilite materials21 coupled to the specific microstructure of these ceramics elaborated by full crystallization from glass (i.e. thin grain boundaries and the absence of porosity) enables the synthesis of transparent ceramics as observed in Fig. 8b.17–20,51 Transmittance measurements recorded from 200 to 3200 nm were acquired on 1.2 mm sample thickness (Fig. 8a). The materials exhibit a transmittance up to 60% in the near infra-red range. This transparency slowly decreases towards the visible region, to eventually lead to opacity below 275 nm. Both Eu1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3 and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 melilite ceramics present additional absorption bands related to the presence of absorbing rare earth elements, Eu and Tb respectively. The transmittance in the visible region remains limited (10 to 15%), but is nevertheless sufficient to see through the materials when they are placed on a support (Fig. 8b). The transmittance curves are typical of transparent polycrystalline ceramics showing a weak birefringence effect (due to an anisotropic crystalline structure) coupled to micrometer scale crystals. This observation is in agreement with the absence of porosity.18,21 The full density of the non-stoichiometric Ln1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ (Ln = Eu, Gd and Tb) melilite ceramics elaborated by complete crystallization from glass is thus supported by the transparency of the materials.

Further applications of these materials as electrolytes in the IT-SOFC would require that these ceramics remain stable at high temperature (500 &lt; T &lt; 700 °C). Therefore, we used two high temperature in situ characterization methods to determine the evolution versus temperature of both the structure and the microstructure of our melilite ceramics. First, in situ XRD was performed by heating the Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 ceramic from room temperature up to 800 °C. For each temperature step (600, 700 and 800 °C), twelve isotherm diffractograms were acquired for a total of 3 hour acquisition per step (Fig. 9a, note that only the last diffractogram recorded at each temperature is presented). No modification of the crystalline structure as well as no secondary phase formation indicating melilite decomposition could be observed. Moreover, an in situ high temperature microstructural study was also performed by TEM (maximum temperature of 800 °C). The micrographs presented in Fig. 9b and S7 (curved boundary) were recorded at a melilite grain boundary and show the presence of two Tb3Ga5O12 nanoparticle aggregates. We chose a defect area on purpose, although the material contains a limited amount of such secondary phase, in order to enable the early detection of microstructural evolution. Once again, no microstructural modification could be observed from room temperature up to 800 °C, at the levels of the grain, the grain boundary or even the aggregate. Therefore, heat treatments up to 800 °C for several hours seem to have no effect on the ceramic structure and microstructure, at least as observed by XRD and TEM.

Oxide ion conductivity of transparent melilite ceramics
The electrical conductivity of the transparent melilite ceramics was characterized by impedance spectroscopy. Fig. 10 shows the complex impedance plot of the Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 ceramic at 250 °C. The data were measured on full dense ceramics with parallel faces prepared by polishing the beads.

Rb and Rt denote the bulk and total resistivities, respectively. The semicircular arcs in blue and red in the inset illustrate the deconvolution of bulk and grain boundary responses in the high frequency region, respectively. The numbers denote the logarithms of the selected frequencies marked by filled circles.
The impedance data is composed of three components related to the bulk, grain boundary and electrode responses. The smallest semi-circular arc in the high frequency region shows a ca. 7 pF cm−1 capacitance value, which is ascribed to the grain response.52 The low frequency intercept of this arc was estimated as the bulk resistivity (Rb). The large incomplete semicircular arc in the intermediate frequency range (104–1 Hz) exhibits a capacitance with a magnitude of ≈10−10 F cm−1,52 suggesting a grain boundary response. The low-frequency Warburg-type spike overlapping with the grain boundary response arc is arising from the electrode response, displaying large capacitances of ≈10−7–10−8 F cm−1, indicative of ionic conduction.52 At elevated temperature, the bulk response arc disappears gradually and the electrode response collapses down to a semicircular arc. Meanwhile, the grain boundary and electrode response arcs become more separated for temperatures above 400 °C (Fig. S8).
Regarding Eu-based compositions, we measured the Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 (x = 0.54) composition, corresponding to the maximum value previously obtained for lanthanum-based melilite synthesized by the solid state reaction.25 Unfortunately the maximum substitution level sample (x = 0.6) was not ready for the impedance measurement campaign. The Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 ceramic shows an impedance behavior similar to Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2, except for less separation between the bulk, grain and electrode response arcs. Compared with Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 and Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27, the Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3 ceramic displays a complex electrical microstructure. Apart from the electrode response arc in the low frequency region, three components can be discerned from the complex impedance plot in the high frequency region below 250 °C (Fig. 11a), leading to three capacitance plateaus in the capacitance versus frequency plot (Fig. 11b). The smallest semicircular arc displays a capacitance of ≈9 pF cm−1, here again ascribed to the bulk response. The other two larger semicircular arcs show capacitances of ≈10−10 F cm−1 and 10−9 F cm−1, which could be linked to two distinct kinds of grain boundary (GB1 and GB2) responses, corresponding for example to two different thicknesses as will be discussed later in the manuscript. The grain boundary response arc overlaps significantly with the electrode response arc below 400 °C and tends to be separated from the electrode response arc when the temperature increases above 400 °C (Fig. S9). In simple words, the high temperature impedance data reveal electrical/microstructural inhomogeneity in these transparent melilite ceramics, consisting of ionic conducting grains coexisting with insulating grain boundary regions.

Fig. 12a presents the bulk conductivity of the three Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3, Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 ceramic compositions. The Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 composition was chosen in order to compare the conductivity properties of our ceramics elaborated by full crystallization from glass with classic ceramics prepared by solid state synthesis. As the x = 0.54 maximum value was previously obtained for the lanthanum-based melilite,25 we used here a similar substitution value of the largest lanthanide element that enables glass formation, i.e. Eu, for easier comparison. A 0.01 S cm−1 bulk conductivity is reached for these different compositions at temperatures of 470, 550 and 650 °C respectively.

The La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 blue dotted line corresponds to the total conductivity measured by Kuang et al.25 on a ceramic synthesized by the solid state reaction. (b) Bulk conductivity of the Tb1+xSr1−xGa3O7+x/2 (with x from 0 to 0.4) ceramics.
For a given temperature, the bulk conductivity ranking of these three ceramics is Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 &lt; Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 &lt; Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3, which is in agreement with the interstitial oxygen contents or the substitution level (x) evolutions in terbium, europium and gadolinium compositions. The scaling of bulk conductivity with the interstitial oxygen content or the substitution level (x) is well evidenced by the x-dependency of the bulk conductivity of Tb1+xSr1−xGa3O7+0.5x (Fig. 12b). The stoichiometric TbSrGa3O7 ceramic is an insulator; but the terbium for strontium substitution leads to an exponential oxide conductivity increase. In fact, a low substitution level (x = 0.2) leads to a conductivity jump by 2 orders of magnitude, and a further increase of the substitution level improves the total conductivity but to a lesser extent. Despite a close substitution level (x) between Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3 and Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27, the bulk conductivity of the gadolinium material is much higher and reaches ≈0.02 S cm−1 at 500 °C. This behavior can be explained by the smaller size of Gd3+ compared to Eu3+ and so a larger size difference with Sr2+, which tends to distort the melilite structure and facilitate oxygen mobility, as previously demonstrated for ceramics prepared by solid state synthesis.53 The pO2-dependency of the bulk conductivity of Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 at 600 °C was measured and the pO2-independency over a wide pO2-range from 1 atm to 10−25 atm (Fig. S10) confirms the pure ionic conduction in the Tb-melilite ceramic (the presence of only Tb3+ in the structure, i.e. the absence of Tb4+, was previously determined by XANES measurements, Fig. 3), as previously observed for La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27.25 The activation energies for the oxide ion conduction in Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2, Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 and Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3 below 500 °C are 0.80(2) eV, 0.729(7) eV and 0.824(6) eV, respectively. These values are close to that of La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 synthesized via the solid state route (0.85(1) eV in the low temperature region).25
Although the Gd1.6Sr0.4Ga3O7.3, Eu1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 and Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 transparent ceramics display promising bulk oxide ion conductivity, their total conductivities are deteriorated by the predominant insulating grain boundary regions and do not present a simple behavior with the interstitial oxygen contents (Fig. 12c). The insulating grain boundary regions, despite very thin and clear interface between two grains, may be attributed to the absence of growth coherence between these grains (well separated and distinguished grains) as compared to materials elaborated by the solid state reaction for which the high temperature synthesis process can establish pathways at the grain boundaries and therefore facilitate oxygen migration: in the La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27 melilite material synthesis via a traditional ceramic method, the grain boundary resistance is slightly lower than the bulk resistance.25 Therefore the total conductivities of these transparent Eu/Gd/Tb-melilite ceramics are lower than that for the best conducting melilite materials so far, La1.54Sr0.46Ga3O7.27, which was synthesized by the solid state reaction.25
Microstructural evolution after ionic conductivity measurements
In order to better understand the effects induced by impedance spectroscopy measurements at high temperature, the transparent melilite ceramics were observed by TEM after multiple heating cycles performed under ionic conductivity measurement conditions (temperatures reached a maximum of 750 °C). Given the large amount of preparation required for these observations, we focused on a single composition, the Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 ceramic. The particular microstructure of this material makes it of particular interest for the microstructural evolution study versus temperature.
In contrast to our previous in situ TEM observations performed only versus temperature, the microstructure of the non-stoichiometric Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 melilite ceramic clearly evolved after ionic conductivity measurements at high temperature, i.e. 750 °C (Fig. 13).

First, the Tb3Ga5O12 aggregates (≈200 nm) previously observed and formed of small aggregated nanoparticles (Fig. 9) are now forming more homogenous spherical particles, suggesting coalescence of the small nanoparticles forming the initial aggregates (Fig. 13a). To better illustrate this point, prove the composition of these spherical particles and understand their formation mechanism, we performed STEM-HAADF imaging and STEM-EDS analyses in the vicinity of a coalesced spherical particle (Fig. 14). It should be noted that for the STEM-HAADF images, the contrast is directly linked to the average atomic number Z of the phases. Consequently, and in contrast to the previously presented TEM images, the Tb3Ga5O12 spherical particles (Z ≈ 22.3) appear with a brighter contrast than the Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 melilite crystalline grain (Z ≈ 21.7). Careful examination of the STEM-HAADF image shows (i) a dark gray crown of 50 nm average thickness around the Tb3Ga5O12 agglomerate and (ii) dark nanoparticles inside the agglomerate (Fig. 14a). The STEM-EDS elemental maps clearly demonstrate a terbium depleted area around the Tb3Ga5O12 agglomerate (Fig. 14a). In order to highlight the spatial cationic composition evolution, STEM-EDS line scan measurements were performed through the matrix (Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7+δ), the Tb depleted area and the Tb3Ga5O12 spherical particle (Fig. 14b). The cationic compositions of the matrix and the particle appear to be close to Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 and Tb3Ga5O12 respectively. However, a Sr excess, compared to the Tb3Ga5O12 nominal composition, is observed in the particle, even though a small contribution of the matrix (Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2) cannot be completely ruled out. The terbium depleted area shows great strontium enrichment and seems to correspond to the stoichiometric TbSrGa3O7 melilite phase (Fig. 14b). Moreover, the dark contrast observed around the Tb3Ga5O12 particle on the STEM-HAADF image could be explained by the average atomic number of TbSrGa3O7 (Z = 21) which is smaller than that of Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 (Z ≈ 21.7).

(b) STEM-HAADF image and the elemental STEM-EDS line scan through the matrix (Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7+δ), the Tb depleted area (TbSrGa3O7) and the Tb3Ga5O12 particle. The dashed lines represent the nominal compositions of the three phases and the black arrows of (b) the position of a nanoparticle inside the Tb3Ga5O12 particle.
The formation mechanism of the Tb depleted area seems to be directly linked to the crystallization mechanism of the Tb3Ga5O12 garnet phase. In fact, the crystallization of Tb3Ga5O12 from the metastable Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 crystalline phase requires local enrichment and depletion in Tb and Sr oxides respectively. Consequently, in the vicinity of the Tb3Ga5O12 phase, a Tb depleted and Sr enriched area is developed. On the other hand, during the ionic conductivity measurements performed at high temperature, the Tb3Ga5O12 spherical particle previously observed coalesce, which embed some matrix inside the particle. The nanoparticles located inside the Tb3Ga5O12 larger particle are characterized by a terbium depletion and a strontium enrichment compared to Tb3Ga5O12 (black arrows on the Fig. 14b). However, it is not possible to precisely determine the nature of these areas.
The main significant microstructural evolution after impedance measurements at high temperature is located at the grain boundaries. The original thin grain boundary (Fig. 7) evolved to a broad interface containing crystalline nanoparticles. These nanoparticles present a relatively large size distribution and show a maximum diameter of 200 nm (Fig. 13b). Electron diffraction experiments performed on these particles show a cubic structure with 3.16 Å interreticular orthogonal distances, which perfectly matches with the (400, 040 and 004) Bragg reflections of the Tb3Ga5O12 garnet structure.
Finally, as observed in Fig. 13a, very small intragranular nanoparticles appear under impedance spectroscopy measurement conditions at high temperature. Unfortunately their size prevents further characterization.
As previously described, the temperature treatment itself, at least up to 800 °C, is not strong enough to deteriorate the microstructure. However, impedance measurements coupled to temperature treatment (during impedance spectroscopy measurements the temperature reached a maximum temperature of 750 °C) can undoubtedly damage the microstructure. We previously stated that the grain boundary is more resistive than the grain, so that a Joule effect54,55 might take place at the grain interface, thus leading to a local temperature exceeding 800 °C (when measuring impedance spectroscopy at 800 °C) and thus deteriorating the melilite ceramic. This hypothesis is supported by in situ isothermal XRD experiments performed at 900 °C (Fig. S11). After 25 min at 900 °C, the crystalline Tb1.4Sr0.6Ga3O7.2 structure starts to get damaged and decomposes into stoichiometric TbSrGa3O7 melilite and Tb3Ga5O12 garnet phases (Sr1−xLn1+xGa3O7+x/2 → SrLnGa3O7 + Ln3Ga5O12). (Note that due to the relatively slow kinetics of this decomposition, the DSC experiment shown in Fig. 1 does not evidence such an evolution.) Furthermore, the total conductivity curves plotted in Fig. S12 show the decrease of the total conductivity after one and two heating cycles (Tmax = 900 °C), supporting the degradation of the materials under ionic conductivity and high temperature measurement conditions. However, the microstructural evolution does not take place homogeneously in the material as many grain boundaries remain thin and unchanged after ionic conductivity measurements (Fig. S13), endorsing the two capacitance plateaux observed in Fig. 11b which we previously attributed to two different kinds of grain boundary thicknesses. We stipulate that preferred macroscopic conductivity paths exist in the ceramic, thus leading to damaged (conductivity paths) and undamaged areas. Despite these nanometer scale modifications, no porosity appears during the high temperature impedance spectroscopy measurements, further confirmed by the retention of transparency. This is an important point to prevent reactant crossover in possible SOFC applications.
Unfortunately, the microstructural evolution cannot be directly correlated with the impedance spectroscopy measurements as in situ nanometre scale characterizations cannot be achieved directly under impedance measurement conditions. Moreover, microstructural evolution versus both temperature and impedance measurements has never been reported for Ln1+xSr1−xGa3O7+δ melilite ceramics obtained from the solid state reaction. Nevertheless, for possible further applications of these materials, microstructural damage could be avoided by limiting the operating temperature below 700 °C.
