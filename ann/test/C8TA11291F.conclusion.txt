Conclusions
In summary, the poly(isatin biphenylene)-based AEMs without aryl ether linkages were prepared by superacid-catalyzed polymerization and subsequently tethered with long alkyl side chains with three different pendent cationic groups. The QAPIB membrane exhibits a maximum hydroxide ion conductivity of 93.88 mS cm−1 at 80 °C while the PyrPIB and PipPIB membranes show hydroxide ion conductivities of 49.08 and 42.94 mS cm−1 at 80 °C, respectively. The AEMs tethered with the long alkyl side chains indicate very good effective performance with high alkaline stability. Among them, the PipPIB membrane could retain 71.7% of the original hydroxide ion conductivity after immersion into 1 M aq. NaOH at 80 °C for 1050 h. Notably, the PyrPIB and PipPIB membranes possess high oxidation durability with the degradation of 36.4 wt% after immersion in Fenton's reagent for 108 h. Moreover, a single fuel cell based on the QAPIB membrane achieves a peak power density of 1.24 W cm−2, which is higher than that of the PipPIB membrane (1.13 W cm−2). Generally, these membranes exhibit excellent fuel cell performance. This study shows that the hetero-cycloaliphatic quaternary ammoniums such as piperidinium could improve the performance of AEMs not only in alkaline stability but also in oxidation durability.
