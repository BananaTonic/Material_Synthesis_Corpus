2.1Materials and measurements
All reagents and solvents used in synthetic studies are commercially available and were used as supplied without further purification. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out with a PANalytical X'Pert3 powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu sealed tube (λ = 1.541874 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA over the 2θ range of 5–30°. The simulated pattern was produced using the Mercury V1.4 program and single-crystal diffraction data. The Fourier transform infrared (KBr pellets) spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 on a Thermo Nicolet 5700 FT-IR instrument. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analyzer. Thermal analysis was carried out on a METTLER TGA/SDTA 851 thermal analyzer from 30 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out with a Mettler Toledo DSC 822e at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere.

2.3Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies
Data collection and structural analysis of crystal FJU-30, FJU-31 and FJU-31@G were performed on an Agilent Technologies SuperNova single crystal diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). The crystal was kept at 293 or 100 K during data collection. Using Olex2,23 the structure was solved with the Superflip24 structure solution program using charge flipping and refined with the ShelXL25 refinement package using least squares minimization. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms on the ligands were placed at idealized positions and refined using a riding model. We employed PLATON26 and SQUEEZE27 to calculate the diffraction contribution of the solvent molecules and thereby produce a set of solvent-free diffraction intensities. The detailed crystallographic data and structure refinement parameters for these compounds are summarized in Table S1, ESI (CCDC 1442065–1442071).
2.4Gas adsorption
After the bulk of the solvent was decanted, the freshly prepared sample of FJU-31@Bu (∼0.15 g) was soaked in CH2Cl2 for 1 hour, and then the solvent was decanted. Following the procedure of CH2Cl2 soaking and decanting 10 times, the solvent-exchanged samples were activated under vacuum at room temperature for 24 h at a pressure of 5 μm Hg. N2 and CO2 adsorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 surface area analyzer for the guest-free FJU-31. The sorption measurement was maintained at 77 K with liquid nitrogen and at 273 K with an ice-water bath (slush). A water bath was used for adsorption isotherms at 296 K.
2.5Proton conductivity measurement
The alternating-current (AC) impedance measurement procedure was similar to our perviously reported one.3 Firstly, the as-synthesized sample was finely ground to a powder and compressed into a homemade cylindrical closed glass container with an inner diameter of 0.4 cm. The sample thickness of 1.60, 2.00, and 2.00 cm, respectively, for FJU-31@Hq, FJU-31@Ch and FJU-31@Bu was measured using a vernier caliper. AC impedance measurements were carried out using a two-probe method with stainless steel-pressed electrodes in a Solartron SI 1260 Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer and 1296 Dielectric Interface Impedance Analyzer over the frequency range of 100 Hz to 10 MHz and the temperature range from subzero to 125 °C with an input voltage of 100 mV under anhydrous conditions. The closed glass container was flushed with dry N2 before measurements to remove moisture. Measurements were performed under anhydrous conditions at thermal equilibrium by holding for 30 minutes at each measuring temperature. Proton conductivity was calculated using the following equation:1where l and S are the length (cm) and cross-sectional area (cm2) of the samples, respectively, and R, which was extracted directly from the impedance plots, is the bulk resistance of the sample (Ω). Activation energy (Ea) for the material conductivity was estimated from the following equation:2where σ is the proton conductivity, σ0 is the preexponential factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. ZView software was used to extrapolate impedance data results by means of an equivalent circuit simulation to complete the Nyquist plot and obtain the resistance values.
