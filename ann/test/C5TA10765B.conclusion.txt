4.Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated that flexible metal–organic frameworks (FMOFs) FJU-31@G (G = hydroquinone (Hq), cyclohexanol (Ch) and butanol (Bu)) with a large breathing effect can accommodate different organic hydroxyl proton carriers to modulate the anhydrous proton conductivity. The flexible skeleton FJU-31 shows high thermal stability up to 400 °C and large breathing effect amplitudes up to 65%. It is rarely reported that single-crystal to single-crystal transformation by the temperature stimulus is guest dependent for the series of MOFs FJU-31@G. The hydroquinone guest with a high melting point and small pKa endows FJU-31@Hq with a small activation energy Ea and high anhydrous proton conductivity, comparable to the best anhydrous proton conductors [Eu2(CO3)(ox)2(H2O)2]·4H2O and His@[Al(OH)(ndc)]n. Although its maximum anhydrous proton conductivity is still lower than some conductors under moist conditions, similar to the cases in other anhydrous proton conductors, FJU-31@Hq has the widest temperature range (−40 to 125 °C) for stable proton conduction among the crystalline porous materials. We do believe that our findings will encourage further work in breathing MOFs to host new proton carriers with better H+ hopping capability for high proton conducting materials over a wide temperature range.
