Conclusions
A SPI with 100% DS was prepared by the direct polycondensation reaction of a naphthalenic dianhydride monomer and a sulfonated diamine monomer. A series of PEMs were prepared by blending SPI with PVDF followed by acidification, of which the PEM with 50 wt% of SPI content revealed higher proton conductivity than Nafion 117. A percolation phenomenon was observed when the weight content of SPI in PEM reached 30% where both proton conductivity and water uptake drastically increased and then stayed proportional to the weight fraction of SPI. The 30 wt% percolation threshold was also confirmed by TEM cross-sectional images which showed densely scattered ionic domains getting connected. A bi-continuous morphology was observed in PEMs with 40 wt% and 50 wt% SPI. In addition, the blend membranes showed a high dimensional stability. This blend PEM system should also be more cost effective compared to Nafion due to much easier synthesis and film processing.
