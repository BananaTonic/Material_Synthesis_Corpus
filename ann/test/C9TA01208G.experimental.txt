Experimental section
Materials
Acrylic acid (AA) and 2, 2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AIBA) were purchased from Aladdin. Acryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (DAC) 80 wt% in water was obtained from J&amp;K Scientific LTD. Carbon black was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Lithium chloride anhydrous (LiCl), poly(vinyl alcohol)1799 (PVA), activated carbon, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) were supplied by Macklin. Nickel foam was provided by MTI Corporation.
Preparation of P(AA-DAC) gel electrolytes
The gel electrolytes were synthesized by random copolymerization of AA and DAC monomers. Briefly, AA and DAC with a total mass of 4 g and distilled water (12 mL) were added into a 20 mL glass bottle, and the molar ratios of the two monomers were controlled to be 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 4, 2 : 1 and 4 : 1, respectively. LiCl was added into the aqueous solution with different concentrations. After stirring the mixed solution in an ice bath for 1.5 hours, 0.04 g of AIBA as the initiator was added. The P(AA-DAC) electrolytes were obtained by carrying out the polymerization at 37 °C for 24 h.
Preparation of the PVA/LiCl electrolyte
The PVA/LiCl gel electrolyte was prepared according to our previous report.37 1.0 g of PVA powder and 1.0 g of LiCl were dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water and heated at 85 °C under stirring. The PVA/LiCl electrolyte was obtained after the gel became transparent.
Assembly of the SC device
Firstly, AC, conductive carbon black and PVDF with a mass ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 were dispersed in NMP to form a homogeneous suspension. Then nickel foam (1.6 mm thickness) was coated with the suspension. The covered area was 0.25 cm−2. After drying at 80 °C for 24 hours in a vacuum drier, the coated nickel foam was pressed to form an AC electrode with a thickness of 0.14 mm. The thickness of the coated active materials is about 20–30 μm (Fig. S7). The mass loading of active materials on one electrode is about 2.2 mg cm−2. The prepared AC electrode was immersed in the anionic and cationic monomer solution with slight shaking to remove the bubbles in the electrode. Then the AC electrode with the gel electrolyte was obtained by in situ polymerization of the monomers at 37 °C for 24 h. The solid SC was fabricated by pressing two AC electrodes with the gel electrolyte together using a home-made compressible device (Fig. S10). This method ensures that the two electrodes are pressed together in parallel and that the thickness remains uniform. After scraping away any excess electrolytes from the edge of the SC, the device was successfully fabricated. The thickness of the whole SC device is about 0.54 mm. For comparison, P(AA-DAC) and PVA/LiCl electrolyte directly coated AC electrodes were also used to assemble SC devices by using the same method.
Conductivity measurement
The conductivity was measured by the two-point method using a Keithley 2450A semiconductor characterization system. A glass tube filled with gel electrolytes was used to measure the conductivity (σ) based on the following equation. As least three values for one gel electrolyte were measured.where R is the resistance, S is the cross-sectional area of the measured electrolyte and L is the length of the measured sample.
Rheology measurements
Rheology measurements were performed with an ARES-G2 Rheometer using a parallel plate of diameter 25 mm. The linear viscoelasticity region was determined by the dynamic strain sweep with a constant frequency of 10 rad s−1 in the range of 0.1–100%. The frequency sweep was recorded at a fixed strain of 1% over the frequency range of 0.1–100 rad s−1. The alternate step strain (1, 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800%) sweep of the electrolytes was recorded at a constant angular frequency of 10 rad s−1. The alternate step strain (1 and 400%) sweep of the electrolytes was measured for different periods of time (200, 400 and 600s).
Adhesion measurement
The adhesion strengths were measured using a universal testing machine (Hensgrand, WDW-02, China) at room temperature and at a tensile speed of 100 mm min−1. Two AC electrodes with in situ polymerized electrolytes were pressed together. The covered area is 5 mm × 35 mm and the thickness is 3 mm. One electrode was fixed on the universal testing machine and the other was peeled off. For comparison, the P(AA-DAC) gel electrolyte and PVA/LiCl electrolyte were simply coated on the AC electrode and measured as above.
Electrochemical measurements
The cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements were carried out using a CHI 660E workstation in a two-electrode system. The impedance spectra were recorded by applying a sine wave with a 10 mV amplitude over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz. Cycle life tests were conducted by GCD measurements. To prevent the water evaporation in the electrolyte, a layer of polyurethane was wrapped on the SC. The specific capacitances of one electrode (Csp,electrode) derived from galvanostatic discharge curves were calculated based on the following equation:where I is the discharge current, Δt is the discharge time, Sdevice is the total area of two electrodes, and ΔV represents the voltage window. Calculations of the energy and power density are based on the following equations:
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
The segments of AA and DAC were used to investigate the effect of the ions (Li+ and Cl−) on the molecular behavior of the polymer. For obtaining the optimized structures, all optimization and electronic structure calculations were done at the B3LYP/def2-SVP level. Solvation effects were incorporated by using the SMD38 solvation model with water as the solvent. The dispersion correction was conducted by using Grimme's D3 version with the BJ damping function.39 All quantum calculations were done with Gaussian09 software.
Characterization
1HNMR spectra of the copolymers dissolved in D2O were recorded with a 1HNMR spectrometer (Bruker AVANCE II 400). Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to determine the molecular weights of the polymers. GPC analysis was performed on a Wyatt DAWN HELEOS system (50 Mw GaAs, λ = 650 nm). Polystyrene standards were used as calibration standards for GPC. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained on an IR Prestige-21 FTIR Spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) at room temperature. Raman spectra were obtained using laser confocal Raman microspectroscopy (Renishaw inVia). The small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were carried out on a SAXSess mc2 (Anton Paar), operating at λ = 0.1542 nm. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a TAQ-10 DSC instrument with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 from −30 °C to 65 °C. Surface contact angles were observed by using a contact angle meter (DSA100). The fluorescence image of the electrode/electrolyte interface was obtained by using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LEICA SP8). The electrolyte was dyed with Rhodamine B. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were observed by using an INCA X-act (Oxford Instruments).
