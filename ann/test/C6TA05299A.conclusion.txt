4.Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed a novel oAFSC device with fluoroelastomer quasi-solid-state organic electrolyte of FKM/Et4NBF4–AN sandwiched by CNT@PPy cathode and CNT@PDAA anode. The cross-linked FKM membrane with 0.5 wt% HMDA as a cross-linker shows excellent elongation at 813% break. After absorbing liquid electrolyte of 185%, as-prepared quasi-solid-state organic electrolyte exhibits a slight plastic deformation (1.4%) after 500 stretching cycles at the strain of 100% and high ionic conductivity of 9.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C. The FKM quasi-solid-state electrolyte also displays excellent nonflammability. Besides, in order to obtain high-performance oAFSCs, we followed the “prestrain-stick-relax-cure-soak” strategy and match the CNT@PPy film cathode with the CNT@PDAA film anode to assemble the CNT@PPy//FKM/Et4NBF4–AN//CNT@PDAA oAFSC. As a result, the oAFSC device shows high energy density of 58.2 W h kg−1 (4.87 mW h cm−3) within the broad potential window of 2.7 V. The entire oAFSC also possesses excellent cycling stability of 88% capacitance retention after 10 000 charging–discharging cycles. This oAFSC can maintain stable electrochemical performance even in stretched, bent, or twisted states. It can also drive commercially available products and thus further facilitate the application of flexible and wearable electronics in the near future.
