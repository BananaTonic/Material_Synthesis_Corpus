2.1Preparation of cross-linked FKM quasi-solid-state organic electrolyte
Fluoroelastomer (FE2603, a copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene, fluorine content 65 wt%, mooney viscosity, ML (1 + 10) at 121 °C = 55), abbreviated as FKM, was procured from Shanghai 3F New Materials Co., Ltd.
The cross-linked fluoroelastomer membranes were prepared by the chemical cross-linking method. Typically, FKM and hexamethylene diamine (HMDA) were dissolved separately in acetone. Different amounts of HMDA solution were then added to the FKM solution. The weight percentages of HMDA with respect to the weight of FKM were kept at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 wt%, respectively. After mechanical stirring for 30 min, the slightly yellow homogenous solutions were obtained. Then the homogenous solutions were let stand for 20 min for deaeration and cast onto PTFE plates. After drying completely at room temperature, the cross-linked FKM membranes were cured at 65 °C for 16 h. After that, the uncross-linked part of the FKM membrane was removed by extraction with acetone in a Soxhlet apparatus. Finally, the cross-linked FKM membranes were immersed in Et4NBF4–AN electrolyte for 1 h to obtain the stretchable FKM quasi-solid-state organic electrolyte.
2.2Preparation of CNT@PPy and CNT@PDAA flexible film electrodes
Both CNT@PPy and CNT@PDAA film electrodes were prepared by an electrochemical polymerization method. For the CNT@PDAA anode, its preparation process is similar to our previous work,47 but with the CNT paper (diameter of CNT = 15–30 nm, Suzhou Creative Nano Carbon of China) of 1 cm × 1.5 cm at 2 C cm−2 polymerization charge density. With regard to the CNT@PPy cathode, prior to electropolymerization, CNT paper was cleaned with ethanol and immersed in mixed solution of 0.05 M pyrrole, 0.01 M KCl, and 0.01 M β-naphthalene sulfonic acid (β-NSA) for 6 h. Then, the CNT paper of 1 cm × 1.5 cm, Pt sheet of 2 cm × 2 cm, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Polypyrrole (PPy) was electropolymerized on CNT papers at +0.7 V in the abovementioned mixed solution for different charge densities (2, 4, 6 C cm−2). The as-prepared CNT@PPy films were cleaned with deionized water and vacuum dried at 50 °C.
2.3Assembly of organic asymmetric flexible supercapacitors
The CNT@PPy//FKM/Et4NBF4–AN//CNT@PDAA oAFSC (SC-1) was assembled by the “prestrain-stick-relax-cure-soak” strategy. The assembly process is as follows (Fig. 1): (1) the uncross-linked FKM membrane containing HMDA was prestrained to 1.5 times of original size all around. (2) The CNT@PPy and CNT@PDAA flat film electrodes were adhered to both sides of prestrained FKM membrane and pressed at 5 MPa for 10 min to allow close contact. (3) The prestrained sandwich-like membrane was relaxed spontaneously. (4) The sandwich-like membrane was tailored and cured at 65 °C for 16 h. (5) In an argon-filled glove box, the CNT@PPy//FKM//CNT@PDAA membrane was immersed in 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate–acetonitrile (Et4NBF4–AN), and then covered with two titanium foils for electrical contact of film electrodes and encapsulated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane. Here, the PDMS membrane was fabricated by vigorously mixing a silicone-elastomer base and curing agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) at a weight ratio of 10 : 1, followed by degassing in a vacuum oven for 30 min and thermally curing at 80 °C for 5 h. The schematic configuration of as-assembly oAFSC was shown in Fig. S1. Only the immersion and encapsulation were carried out in an argon-filled glove box.

For comparison, the CNT@PPy//FKM/Et4NBF4–AN//CNT@PDAA oAFSC (SC-2) was also assembled using the routine “cure-soak-stick” method, which means that the cross-linked FKM membrane was soaked in 1 M Et4NBF4–AN organic electrolyte and then the film electrodes were stuck on its both sides (Fig. S2).
2.4Characterization
The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were characterized using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a Smart OMNI Sampler. The weight loss of the samples were measured using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, NET-ZSCH STA 449C) from room temperature to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The morphologies of the samples were observed via the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800). X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected by a Rigaku D/Max 2550 VB/PC X-ray diffractometer using Cu (Kα) radiation with the 2θ-angle recorded from 3–50°. The mechanical properties of the FKM membranes were evaluated with a Zwick Roell testing system at a tensile speed of 100 mm min−1.
The ionic conductivity of FKM/Et4NBF4–AN quasi-solid-state organic electrolyte can be obtained by the equation σ = L/(Rb × S), where L is the thickness (cm) of the FKM/Et4NBF4–AN quasi-solid-state organic electrolyte, S is the effective area (cm2), and Rb is the bulk resistance (Ω) obtained from the AC impedance date. The Et4NBF4–AN electrolyte uptake was calculated by the following equation: electrolyte uptake = (Ww − Wd)/Wd × 100%, where Wd is the dry weight of FKM membrane dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C, and Ww is the wet weight of FKM membrane immersed in Et4NBF4–AN. The swelling ratio of the membrane was calculated according to the following equation: swelling ratio = (Dw − Dd)/Dd × 100%, where Dd and Dw are the diagonal length of dry and swollen membranes, respectively. The gel fraction of the membrane was calculated via the following equation: gel fraction = W2/W1 × 100%, where W1 and W2 are the weight of FKM membrane before and after extraction, respectively.
2.5Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of oAFSC devices were conducted on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. Cycling stability was obtained using a program testing system (Land CT2001A). The specific capacitance, energy and power densities of the full oAFSC devices were calculated based on total mass of cathode and anode. The volumetric specific capacitance, volumetric energy and volumetric power densities of the full oAFSC device were calculated based on total volumes of two electrodes and quasi-solid-state organic electrolyte. Three-electrode mode measurements for electrodes were performed inside an Ar-filled glove box. The as-prepared film electrodes were used directly as working electrode with Pt counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ reference electrode.
