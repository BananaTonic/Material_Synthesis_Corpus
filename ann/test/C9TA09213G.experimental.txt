2.2Synthesis of 2,7-dibromo-9,9-bis(6-bromohexyl)-fluorene
The compound was synthesized by a modified published procedure.52 2,7-Dibromofluorene (5 g, 15.4 mmol), TBAB (0.49 g, 1.52 mmol) and 1,6-dibromohexane (52 ml, 82 g, 338 mmol) were added to a two-neck round bottom flask. Next, 15.4 ml of 45 wt% aq. KOH was added and the mixture was stirred at 75 °C for 1 h. After extracting the mixture three times with DCM, the organic layer was washed three times with brine and dried over MgSO4. Subsequently, the organic mixture was evaporated under vacuum to remove the excess 1,6-dibromohexane. Finally, the crude product was purified by dry vacuum column chromatography, using a mixture of heptane and toluene as the eluent.53 The product was isolated as a white powder (7.2 g, 72% isolated yield).
2.3Synthesis of 2,7-diphenyl-9,9-bis(6-bromohexyl)-fluorene (DPBHF)
2,7-Dibromo-9,9-bis(6-bromohexyl)-fluorene (7.1 g, 10.9 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (135 ml) in a two-neck round bottom flask. Next, phenylboronic acid (4.0 g, 32.8 mmol) and 135 ml of 1 M Na2CO3 solution (135 ml) were added. The mixture was degassed by 4 vacuum/argon cycles. Pd(PPh3)4 (13.6 mg, 0.08 mmol) was added to the solution and the reaction mixture was refluxed under argon for 48 h. The resulting mixture was extracted with DCM, washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. The organic phase was passed through a silica plug, and evaporated until dryness to yield the target compound as yellow crystals (6.75 g, 96% isolated yield).
2.4Synthesis of 9,9-dioctyl-2,7-diphenyl-9H-fluorene (DODPF)
2,7-Dibromo-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene (2.0 g, 3.5 mmol) and toluene (35 ml) were added to a two-neck round bottom flask. After addition of phenylboronic acid (1.33 g, 10.5 mmol) and 35 ml of 1 M Na2CO3, the mixture was degassed by 4 vacuum/argon cycles. Subsequently, Pd(PPh3)4 (4.2 mg, 0.10 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed under argon for 48 h. The resulting mixture was extracted with DCM, washed with brine, and then dried over MgSO4. Next, the mixture was purified by dry vacuum column chromatography, using a volumetric gradient mixture of heptane and toluene as the eluent, to give the product as white crystals (1.18 g, 60% isolated yield).
2.5Polycondensation
A bromoalkylated precursor copolymer based on DPBHF, DODPF and TFAp was prepared using a Friedel–Crafts type polycondensation reaction under nitrogen (Scheme 1). DPBHF (2.5 g, 3.88 mmol) and DODPF (0.26 g, 0.48 mmol) were dissolved in dry DCM (17 ml) in a Schlenk round-bottom flask. After addition of TFAp (0.67 ml, 4.8 mmol) the solution was cooled in an ice bath. Next, TFSA (2.9 ml, 33 mmol) was added dropwise. After 90 min when the viscosity had increased drastically, the reaction was terminated by dilution with chloroform followed by precipitation of the product in methanol. The precipitate was dried under vacuum to give the precursor polymer, designated as PDPF, as a white fibrous material.
Preparation of the PDPF copolymer by superacid catalyzed polycondensation of DODPF, DPBHF and TFAp, followed by quaternization reactions to attach Qui, Pip and TMA cations, respectively.
2.6Quaternization
The precursor copolymer PDPF was functionalized in Menshutkin reactions with three different quaternary amines, quinuclidine, 1-methylpiperidine and trimethylamine to form the cationic copolymers designated as PDPF–Qui, PDPF–Pip and PDPF–TMA, respectively. The preparation of PDPF–TMA is given as an example. Trimethylamine (1.08 ml, 7.9 mmol, 5 equiv., 400% excess) was added to a solution of the precursor polymer (0.7 g, 1 equiv.) in NMP (20 g) and the reaction was stirred at room temperature for 7 days. The polymer was precipitated in 200 ml of diethyl ether, washed with fresh diethyl ether three times, and then dried under vacuum at room temperature. The Menshutkin reactions involving 1-methylpiperidine and quinuclidine followed the same procedure, but were performed at 80 °C because of their lower reactivity.
2.7Structural characterization
1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker DRX400 spectrometer at a proton frequency of 400.13 MHz. The solvents used were DMSO-d6 (δ = 2.50 ppm) and chloroform-d (δ = 7.26 ppm). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was carried out using a Malvern Viscotek instrument with a 2×PL-Gel Mix-B LS column set (2 × 30 cm) equipped with OmniSEC Triple Detectors (refractive index, viscosity and light scattering) with chloroform as the eluent at 35 °C. A polystyrene standard (Mn = 96 kDa and PDI = 1.03, Polymer Laboratories Ltd.) was used for calibration. The precursor PDPF copolymer was dissolved in chloroform for 24 h prior to the measurement and passed through a Teflon filter with a pore diameter of 0.2 μm before injection.
2.8Membrane preparation
AEMs were prepared by solvent casting at 80 °C for 48 h from 5 wt% polymer solutions in NMP. The polymers were dissolved overnight at room temperature and then passed through a Teflon filter (0.45 μm) onto a Petri dish (Ø = 5 cm). After the casting process, the membranes were carefully peeled from the dishes and washed several times with deionized water. The AEMs were stored in deionized water at room temperature for at least 48 h prior to any measurement.
2.9Determination of ion exchange capacity and water uptake
The experimental ion exchange capacity (IECtitr) was determined by Mohr titration. At least 0.05 g of membrane sample in the Br− form was dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 48 h. Next, the sample was immediately weighed and immersed in 25.0 ml of 0.2 M NaNO3 at 40–50 °C for 5 days to achieve full exchange of the Br− ions. A 5 ml solution was titrated with 0.01 M aq. AgNO3 using K2CrO4 as the indicator. The end point of the titration was observed by a color change from yellow to reddish brown, as well as by precipitation of Ag2CrO4. The titration was repeated 3 more times for each sample to obtain the average value of IECtitr. Finally, the IEC of the AEMs in the OH− form (IECOH) was calculated as:1
In order to measure the water uptake of the AEMs, the dry weight of the membranes in the Br− form (WBr) was first measured after drying under vacuum at 50 °C for 48 h. The values of WBr and IECtitr were both used to calculate the dry weight of the AEMs in the OH− form (WOH). The dry membranes in the Br− form were ion-exchanged to the OH− form by immersion in degassed 1 M aq. NaOH (60 ml) solution for 5 days under a nitrogen atmosphere. During this period, the degassed 1 M aq. NaOH solution was replaced at least three times with fresh solution to ensure complete conversion. Next, the membranes were quickly washed five times with degassed de-ionized water until the rinse water was neutral. The membranes were then transferred to deionized degassed water and kept for 24 h under nitrogen at 20 °C. Finally, the samples were wiped dry with tissue paper and quickly weighed to obtain W′OH. The same procedure was applied at 40 °C for 10 h and at 60 and 80 °C for 6 h. The water uptake was calculated as:2The hydration number (λ), defined as the number of water molecules per functional group, was calculated as:3
2.10Thermal characterization
The thermal decomposition of the AEMs was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a TA instruments TGA Q5000. Before the analysis, the samples were dried at room temperature for 7 days under vacuum. All membranes in the Br− form were preheated to 150 °C for 10 min in the furnace to remove traces of water. Data were collected in the temperature range 50–600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The decomposition temperature (Td,95) is defined as the temperature where 5% weight loss is noted. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) model Q2000 analyzer from TA Instruments was employed to measure the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the precursor copolymer. Data from a heating/cooling/heating cycle were collected between 50 and 280 °C and the Tg values were determined from the second heating cycle.
2.11Conductivity measurements
The OH− conductivity of the AEMs was measured by using a Novocontrol high resolution dielectric analyzer V 1.01 S at 50 mV, in a frequency range of 10−1 to 107 Hz. First, the samples were ion-exchanged to the OH− form, following the same procedure as for the water uptake measurements described above. The OH− conductivity was subsequently measured during the cycle 20 → 80 → 20 → 80 °C under fully hydrated (immersed) conditions using a two-probe method.
2.12Small angle X-ray scattering
Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were performed to study any ionic clustering in the dry AEMs in the Br− form. The analysis was carried out using a SAXLAB ApS system (JJ-Xray, Denmark) combined with a Pilatus detector. The scattering vector (q) is related to the scattering angle according to:4where λ is the wavelength of the Cu K(α) radiation (1.542 Å) and 2θ is the scattering angle. The average distance between ionic clusters (d) is calculated by Bragg's law5
2.13Alkaline stability measurements
The thermochemical stability of the AEMs under alkaline conditions was studied using 1H NMR spectroscopy before and after storage in alkaline solutions at elevated temperature. Pieces of membranes were stored in 2 M aq. NaOH for 28 days and in 5 M aq. NaOH for 7 days at 90 °C, respectively. After the storage, the membranes were washed with deionized water and ion-exchanged to the Br− form, followed by thorough washing with deionized water to remove salt. After drying, the samples were dissolved in DMSO-d6 and analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. TFA (20 vol%) was added to NMR sample solutions to shift the water signal from 3.33 to ∼10 ppm, and expose the sample signals in the 3–3.5 ppm region.
