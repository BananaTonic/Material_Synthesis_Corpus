Experimental
Samples characterization
The morphology of the samples is investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4800 at 3 kV). FTIR measurements are conducted on a Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (Bruker VERTEX 70). The Gurley value is obtained using a Gurley-type densometer (4110N, Gurley) by measuring the time for 100 cm3 air to pass through the membranes or separators. The porosity is measured by immersing the membranes into n-butanol for 10 h and calculated with the following equation: P = (mb/ρb)/(mb/ρb + ma/ρa) × 100%,39,54 where ma and mb are the mass of the membranes and n-butanol, ρa and ρb are the density of membrane materials and n-butanol, respectively. A differential scanning calorimeter (Diamond DSC, PerkinElmer) is used to evaluate the thermal properties of the membranes. Samples are scanned from room temperature to 300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. To characterize their thermal shrinkage behavior, the membranes are placed in an oven and stored at varied temperatures for 2 h. The thermal shrinkage ratio (TSR) is calculated according to the equation: TSR = [(So − S)/So] × 100%. Here, So and S represent the area of the membrane before and after thermal treatment at varied temperatures for 2 h, respectively.
Electrochemical evaluation
The electrochemical stability window of the PFCA–CPE is determined by a linear sweep voltammetry experiment performed on a working electrode of stainless steel and a counter electrode of lithium metal at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The ionic conductivity of the LE and PFCA–CPE between two stainless steels is tested via the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 106 Hz. Taking into account the effects of the polarization over the electrode/electrolyte interphase, the lithium transference number (tLi+) is calculated using the Bruce–Vincent–Evans equation: tLi+ = [Iss × (V − IoRo)]/[Io × (V − IssRss)],55,56 where V is the applied voltage, Io and Iss are initial current and steady-state values, respectively, and Ro and Rss are the initial and the steady state interfacial resistance, respectively. The current–time curve is followed by a DC polarization of 0.030 V. 2032-type coin cells are assembled by sandwiching the electrolyte between the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode and Li anode. In addition, lithium ion batteries are assembled with the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode and graphite anode. The AC impedance spectra of batteries are obtained by EIS measurements in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 106 Hz.
