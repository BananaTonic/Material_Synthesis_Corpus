2.1.Preparation of LLO@CNT composites
The appropriate amount of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) was dissolved in ethanol, followed by addition of acid treated CNTs and a certain amount of pristine LLOs (Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2, JiangSu Haian Zhichuan Co. Ltd.). The concentration of CNTs was 0.5 g L−1 and PVP contributed to strengthening the dispersion of CNTs. Then the liquid suspension was sufficiently decentralized by ultrasonication and stirring to realize the superior coating. Finally, the liquid suspension was repeatedly washed with ethanol and further dried at 80 °C for 12 h, and LLO@CNT composites were successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the coating content of CNTs was adjusted to 1, 2 and 4 wt% to obtain the optimum content (Fig. S1 and S2 display the SEM images and electrochemical profile curves of LLO@CNT composites with different CNT contents, respectively, confirming that the optimum content of CNTs is 2 wt%).
2.2.Preparation of LLO@LATP and LLO@LATP@CNT composites
Analytical reagent-grade LiNO3, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Ti(OC4H9)4, and NH4H2PO4 were used as raw materials with citric acid as the polymer precursor and ultrapure water as the solvent to prepare the LATP precursor.31 As shown in Fig. S3, the diffraction peaks can be attributed to LATP (PDF#35-0754) except one peak that appears at ∼22° corresponding to AlPO4 (PDF#31-0028). The concentration of AlPO4 formed as an impurity is very low according to the XRD pattern, and it is difficult to determine its amount under the existing conditions (i.e. XRD and XPS). It is worth noting that the presence of ALPO4 may improve the Li-ion conduction of the LATP solid electrolyte.32 Besides, according to Thokchom's report, the AlPO4 impurity could also be a source for the space charge mediation that forms an AlPO4:Li+ complex to support the migration of Li ions when the AlPO4 particles are fewer in number and smaller in size.33 Ti(OC4H9)4 was carefully dropped into a 50 wt% citric acid solution with the pH value adjusted to 7 with ammonium hydroxide and stirred at 70 °C for about 1 h, forming a titanium citrate solution. Then stoichiometric LiNO3, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and NH4H2PO4 were added to the titanium citrate solution under continuous stirring until the solution became homogeneous. Since the pH value was adjusted to 7 again, a certain volume of glycol was added to promote the polyesterification and polycondensation reactions, followed by heating at 80 °C for 1 h to synthesize the clear oleosus LATP precursor sol. In this work, the molar ratio of [citric acid + glycol] to [Li+ + Al3+ + Ti4+] was 8 : 1. Subsequently, a small amount of LATP precursor sol was slowly added dropwise into 10 mL ultrapure water under ultrasonication to be well dispersed, and then 1 g of LLOs was mixed into the sol dispersion liquid under magnetic stirring. After constant stirring at 80 °C for about 8 h, the dark mixture was further dried in an oven at 100 °C for 12 h and then subjected to further sintering at 650 °C for 4 h in air with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 to acquire LLO@LATP composites. The thermogravimetry (TG) curve of the LLO@LATP precursor is shown in Fig. S4, ascertaining that the calcination temperature is 650 °C. Finally, the optimum content of CNTs was employed to prepare LLO@LATP@CNT composites by using the as-prepared LLO@LATP composites as the precursor and the preparation process is similar to the method of preparing LLO@CNT composites as illustrated in Fig. 1.

2.3.Materials characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using a PANalytical Empyrean instrument with Cu Kα radiation at 2θ = 10–80°. The morphologies of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-7800F &amp; TEAM Octane Plus) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 &amp; X-Max80); moreover, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was used to analyze the distribution of surface elements. Thermogravimetry (TG) tests were carried out at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in air using a TGA Q-50 apparatus in order to ascertain the appropriate calcination temperature for the LLO@LATP precursor before sintering.
2.4.Electrochemical tests
The working electrodes were prepared from the slurries of active materials, acetylene black, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 mixed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. Then, the slurries were spread onto Al foil and dried at 80 °C for 12 h in a vacuum. The electrochemical performances of the samples were evaluated using CR2032 coin cells assembled with lithium metal as the counter electrode, a porous polypropylene membrane (Celgard 2400) as the separator and 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a solution mixture of propylene carbonate (PC)/ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (volume ratio = 1 : 1 : 1) as the electrolyte in an argon-filled glovebox. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were carried out on a LAND battery test system at room temperature, and the initial cycle was executed at 0.05C between 2.0 and 4.8 V (vs. Li/Li+) for activation and the following cycles were conducted at 0.2C or 1C between 2.0 and 4.65 V (vs. Li/Li+).
2.5.Dynamic characterization measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), GITT, AC impedance and DC polarization experiments were performed using an IVIUM-N-Stat electrochemical workstation. EIS tests were carried out in the frequency range from 10−3 to 105 Hz with a voltage amplitude of 5 mV at a charged state of 4.65 V. For the GITT measurements, the cells were discharged at a constant current density of 0.2C for 10 min, and then kept up for 40 min under open circuit conditions to a steady state. AC impedance and DC polarization measurements were carried out on the dense pellets with a diameter of ∼16 mm and a thickness of ∼0.2–0.3 mm pressed under 40 MPa for 5 min. AC impedance tests were conducted in the frequency range from 10−3 to 106 Hz with a voltage amplitude of 50 mV. DC polarization tests were carried out in the voltage range from 10 to 50 mV.
