Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals required for synthesis were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. 1-Bromododecane (Fluka; &gt;99.5%), lithium aluminium hydride (95%, Aldrich), sodium borohydride (98%, Aldrich), thionyl chloride (99%, Aldrich), triethylphosphite (95%, Fluka), triethyl silyl bromide (98%, Aldrich), triethyl amine (Fluka; p.a. &gt; 99.5%), methanol (Fisher Scientific; HPLC, 99.8%), toluene (Sigma Aldrich; 99.8%), aqueous HCl (Prolabo; p.a. 37%), and NaOH (Sigma Aldrich; 98%) were used as received.
Characterization
1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on 250 MHz Bruker spectrometers. 1H NMR chemical shifts are reported in ppm vs. residual protons in deuterated solvents as follows: δ = 7.27; CDCl3 and δ = 2.50; (CD3)2SO. Solvent proton or carbon signals were used as the internal standard for 1H NMR and 13C NMR measurements, respectively, while triphenylphosphine (TPP) was applied for the calibration of the 31P NMR measurements.
Thermal stability of all block copolymers was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a Perkin Elmer TGA 7 thermogravimetric analyzer (10 K min−1 heating rate in a nitrogen atmosphere). All TGA trace data were obtained from 30 °C to 500 °C.
Wide angle X-ray (WAX) measurements
The samples for 2D wide angle X-ray experiments were prepared by a filament extrusion method where the material is heated to its deformable state in order to extrude it as a thin filament. In this process, the deformed samples are processed mechanically through a piston along the cylinder by a constant-rate motion.
A number of parameters such as the velocity of the piston, diameter of the cylinder and orifice, and the shape of the die govern this process. The macroscopic draw ratio (λ = (R/r)2) can be described by the ratio of the cylinder to orifice diameters whereas the drawing rate profile can be defined by the shape of the die used.
The drawing rate remains constant in the conical die, whereas it becomes zero inside the cylinder and at the orifice of the die. The inner diameters of the cylinder and the orifice were 2.0 mm and 0.7 mm, respectively. The thickness of the filaments prepared by this method was about 0.7 mm. The movement of the pistol was controlled at the rate of 5 mm s−1 in order to have a high drawing rate of dλ/dt = 20 s−1. All X-ray diffraction measurements have shown no effect of drawing rate on the columns that were oriented in the direction of the extrusion. A 2D wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) setup was used to perform structure and self-assembly investigations. In all cases, the position of the samples was maintained perpendicular to the incident X-ray beam. The reflection positions obtained in the 2D WAXS pattern can provide information about the intra- and inter-columnar supramolecular organization of the desired sample.
Anhydrous proton conductivity
The temperature dependent proton conductivity under dry conditions was investigated by using a Schlumberger SI 1260 impedance/gain phase analyzer with a dielectric interface in the frequency range from 10−1 to 106 Hz with the temperature ranging from 20 °C to 160 °C with increments of 10 °C. The measurements were carried out on a Novocontrol cryostat (Novocontrol, Hundsangen, Germany) in which the sample was sandwiched between two Pt electrodes under a nitrogen gas atmosphere. All samples were pressed in the form of pellets using a pellet making instrument and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h prior to carrying out the proton conductivity experiments.
