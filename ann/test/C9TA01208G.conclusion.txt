Conclusions
In summary, a series of polyampholyte gel electrolytes were demonstrated to be suitable for use in energy storage devices. Different ionic transport and ionic conductivity mechanisms have been proposed at different salt concentrations based on FTIR, Raman, SAXS, DSC and DFT calculations. Our data prove the existence of molecular clusters and Li+(H2O)2 clusters at low or without salt concentration and at an excess salt content, respectively, which blocks the ion transport. The mechanical strength and ionic conductivity of the electrolyte can be tuned by changing the anionic and cationic monomer ratio and LiCl content. The interfacial resistance between the AC electrode and electrolyte is greatly reduced by in situ polymerization of the monomers in the presence of an AC electrode. Remarkably, the AC electrode with the in situ polymerized electrolyte has a high areal specific capacitance of 297 mF cmâˆ’2 and the fabricated SCs not only have high energy density and power density but also have good self-healing performance without loss of capacitance.
