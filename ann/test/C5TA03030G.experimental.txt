Experimental section
NTBPZ (42(Na2O + NaF)–2TiO2–13B2O3–38P2O5–5ZrF4) glass was prepared by a conventional melt-quenching method. NaPO3 (Aldrich, 99%), TiO2 (Aldrich, 99%), H3BO3 (Alfa, 99.99%), P2O5 (Aldrich, 99.99%), NaF (Aldrich, 99.99%) and ZrF4 (Alfa, 99.9%) precursors were mixed in stoichiometric proportions, then melted in an alumina crucible in a globar electrical furnace at 1300–1350 °C for 40 min. The molten sample was rapidly quenched in liquid nitrogen to obtain the NTBPZ glass. The NTBPZ glass powders were prepared from the NTBPZ glass by a mechanical method through a planetary ball mill (QM-QX, QM-QX4). The NTBPZ glass was placed into a zirconia (ZrO2) vessel (internal volume of 50 ml) with 40 ZrO2 balls (4 mm in diameter). The process used a rotation speed of 510 r.p.m. for 5 hours. Then, the NTBPZ glass powders were heated at 515 °C for 15 hours to obtain the NTBPZ glass–ceramic powders. Finally the NTBPZ glass and glass–ceramic electrolyte powders were compressed by a cold pressing method to prepare a pellet that was 10 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick for electrical measurements.
The Tc was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (PerkinElmer, STA 8000). XRD (D8 Advance, Bruker) measurements of the prepared materials were performed using Cu Kα to identify the crystalline phases. The microstructure of the cross-section of the electrolyte pellets was observed by SEM (S4800, Hitachi). Transmission electron microscopy images of the diffraction ring were tested by TEM (2100F, JEM).
The electrical conductivities of the cold-pressed NTBPZ glass and glass–ceramic powder samples were measured using an AC impedance method under Ar gas. The NTBPZ glass and glass–ceramic were cold-compressed in 32 MPa and 160 MPa (MS1-100, RIKEN), separated into pellets with a 10 mm diameter, and then stainless steel plates were attached to both sides of the pellet as the electrodes. Impedance spectra were recorded using an impedance analyser (1470E, Solartron) in the frequency range between 1 Hz and 1 MHz.
