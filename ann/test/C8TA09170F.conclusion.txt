Conclusions
In summary, LiTa2PO8 was synthesized and characterized as the first member corresponding to m = 2 and n = 1 in the lithium-stuffed framework family, Ax(MO6/2)m(TO4/2)n. The bulk conductivity (1.6 × 10−3 S cm−1) and total conductivity (2.5 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 25 °C of this compound are comparable to the highest values reported to date for perovskite, NASICON, and garnet-type compounds. Through SXPD and NPD measurements and BVEL analysis, we found that an effective 3D pathway for lithium-ion conduction could be formed in the LiTa2PO8 structure, which may provide a new platform for developing more advanced solid-state electrolytes.
