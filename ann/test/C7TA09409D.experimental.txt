2.Experimental section
2.1.Polymerization
Monomers 1 and 2 were synthesized according to the literature (see ESI).12–15 A typical procedure is as follows.16 A 100 mL three-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet and mechanical stirrer was charged with monomer 1 (1.52 g, 2.91 mmol), monomer 2 (0.82 g, 1.67 mmol), 2,2′-bipyridine (1.70 g, 10.91 mmol), and DMAc (11 mL). The mixture was heated at 80 °C to obtain a homogeneous mixture. To the mixture, Ni(COD)2 (3.00 g, 10.9 mmol) was added. After polymerization for 3 h, the mixture was poured into a mixture of methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid (1 : 1 by volume, 150 mL) to precipitate a black fibrous solid. The crude product was washed with concentrated hydrochloric acid (100 mL) and then treated with 0.2 M potassium carbonate aqueous solution (200 mL). The pale yellow product was washed with deionized water (200 mL) and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven to obtain 1.92 g of PAF-4 (m1.00 n0.57) as a yellow fibrous solid in 96% yield.
2.2.Preparation of QPAF-4 membranes
A typical procedure is as follows. A 50 mL round-bottomed flask was charged with PAF-4 (m1.00 n0.57) (1.70 g, 2.88 mmol of dimethylamino groups) and DMAc (9.6 mL). After dissolution of the polymer, iodomethane (0.45 mL, 7.22 mmol) was added into the mixture. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at r.t. and diluted with DMAc (10 mL). The mixture was filtered with a syringe stuffed with cotton and the filtrate was cast onto a flat glass plate. Drying the solution at 50 °C overnight produced a transparent light brown membrane. The resulting membrane was washed with deionized water (2 L) and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven to obtain the QPAF-4 membrane (ca. 50 μm thick). The counter anions were converted to hydroxide ions by soaking the membrane in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution at 80 °C for 48 h. The resulting membrane was washed and immersed in degassed, deionized water for at least 1 day to ensure complete removal of excess KOH. QPAF-4 in the chloride ion form was prepared by treating the membrane in the hydroxide ion form with 1 M hydrochloric acid for 48 h at r.t.
2.3.Preparation of catalyst coated membrane (CCM)
1.0 g of Ni/C (50 wt% Ni on ECP600JD) powder was mixed with 5.5 g of 2.0 wt% QPAF-4 (IEC = 1.11 meq. g−1), and 23.5 g of DMF/EtOH solution (1 : 1 by weight). The mixture was mixed using a ball mill with zirconia beads (diameter = 5.0 mm, Nikkato Corporation) for 50 min at 240 rpm. The obtained slurry was sprayed onto one side of the QPAF-4 membrane (IEC = 1.11 meq. g−1 and thickness = 50 μm) to form the anode catalyst layer. The cathode catalyst layer was formed on the other side of the membrane in a similar manner with the slurry prepared from 1.0 g of Pt/C (TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo) powder and 15.0 g of 2.0 wt% QPAF-4 (IEC = 2.07 meq. g−1) solution in DMF/EtOH. The loaded amounts of the catalysts were ca. 2.6 mg cm−2 for Ni/C in the anode and ca. 1.25 mg cm−2 for Pt/C in the cathode. The obtained CCM was pressed at 3.25 MPa for 30 s at room temperature to ensure tight contact between the catalyst layers and the membrane.
2.4.Fuel cell operation
The CCM with 4 cm2 of the geometric electrode area was mounted in a single cell and treated with 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution for 72 h at 60 °C to ensure the ion exchange reaction. A fuel cell was operated at 60 °C, supplying a mixture of 1.0 M KOH and 10 wt% hydrazine aqueous solution to the anode at a flow rate of 1.2 mL min−1 and humidified oxygen or air (62% relative humidity) to the cathode at a flow rate of 0.1 mL min−1. The operating pressure was set at ambient pressure for the anode and 10 kPa for the cathode. Serpentine and comb-shaped flow fields were used for the anode and the cathode, respectively.
