2.Experimental section
2.1Chemicals and materials
Poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA, average Mn = 360 g mol−1), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, average Mn = 400 g mol−1) trimethyl borate (TMB, ≥99.8%), and acetonitrile (CH3CN, 99.0%) were obtained from Aladdin. Glycerol monomethacrylate (GMMA, 97%) was purchased from J&amp;K Scientific. 1.0 mol L−1 lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) dissolved in a mixed ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1 : 1 vol%) solution purchased from Aladdin.
2.2Synthesis of boron-containing cross-linkers
2.2.1Synthesis of linear boron-containing cross-linkers (LBCs)
TMB (4.16 g, 0.04 mol) and GMMA (6.40 g, 0.04 mol) were mixed in 30 mL anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN) and the solution was stirred at 65 °C for 2 h in a dry N2 atmosphere. Then, PEG (8 g, 0.02 mol) was injected to the solution and continuously reacted for 4 h at 70 °C. The organic solvent was eliminated by rotary evaporation and the product was dried under vacuum at 70 °C over 12 h. After the operation, the LBC was obtained with almost 89.73% yield and stored in an argon filled glove box.
2.2.2Synthesis of branched boron-containing cross-linkers (TBCs)
TMB (0.426 g, 0.0041 mol) and PEGMA (4.32 g, 0.012 mol) were mixed in 30 mL anhydrous acetonitrile (CH3CN) and the solution was stirred at 60 °C for 4 h in a N2 atmosphere. Then, the temperature was increased to 70 °C and the solution was continuously stirred for 3 h under N2 purging to remove methanol (CH3OH) that was produced as a byproduct. Residual ingredients and solvent were evaporated under reduced pressure at 60 °C and dried under vacuum at room temperature over 48 h to get 4.4 g of the TBC with 87% yield and stored in an argon filled glove box.
2.3Synthesis of gel polymer electrolytes
Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) were prepared through an in situ thermal polymerization method. Stoichiometric amounts of the TBC and LBC were mixed into a bottle as precursors at different molar ratios. Then 1 mol L−1 LiTFSI and 0.5 wt% AIBN were added to the nonaqueous solution (EC : DMC = 1 : 1) with stirring over 20 min until all the components were monodispersed. The mixed solution was injected into a 2016-type coin cell, where a cellulose membrane was used as the supporting medium for the 3D-BGPEs. Following that, the batteries were heated at 70 °C for 1 h. All steps for producing the 3D-BGPEs were handled in an argon filled glove box.
2.4Characterization
Structural information on the cross-linkers was investigated by 1H, 11B, and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Avance III 400 MHz Digital NMR spectrometer). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) tests were carried out on an FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet 6700). The morphologies of 3D-BGPEs and Li metal foil were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova Nano SEM 230). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed with Cu Kα radiation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi system (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). Stress–strain curves were measured using a universal mechanical analyzer (DMA Q800, TA instruments) at a rate of 1% elongation per minute.
2.5Electrochemical analysis
Ionic conductivity of the 3D-BGPE was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a PARSTAT 4000 electrochemical potentiostat/galvanostat system. A potential of 10 mV was applied to stainless steel (SS) electrode symmetrical cells with frequencies ranging from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The ionic conductivity can be calculated using the following equation:σ = I/(RbA)where I stands for the film thickness, Rb represents the bulk resistance, and A represents the area.
The Li+ transference numbers (tLi+) were measured by DC polarization/AC impedance in symmetric Li/3D-BGPE/Li cells. The tLi+ value can be calculated using the following equation:tLi+ = ISS(V − I0R0)/[I0(V − ISSRSS)]where V is the polarization voltage applied, I0 and R0 represent the initial current and interfacial resistance respectively, and ISS and RSS are the steady state current and interfacial resistance, respectively.
The electrochemical stability of the 3D-BGPE investigated by cyclic voltammetry scans with SS/3D-BGPE/Li coin cells. The negative scan was swept from 2.5 V to −0.5 V and then back to 2.5 V and the positive scan was from 2.5 V to 5 V at a rate of 5 mV s−1.
2.6Battery assembly and measurement
For the cathode, LiFePO4, carbon black, and PVDF were mixed in an 80 : 10 : 10 weight ratio in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The mixture was fully stirred over 2 h to form a slurry. The slurry was cast onto Al foil and dried in a vacuum oven at 110 °C for 12 h to remove the NMP. The mass loading of the active material was about 1.0 mg cm−2. All LiFePO4/3D-BGPE/Li coin cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box. Galvanostatic charge–discharge tests were carried out on LANHE CT2001A systems with the potential range of 2.5–4.0 V.
2.7Calculation methods
All the DFT calculations were performed with the Yang–Parr correlation functional (B3LYP) utilizing the framework of the Gaussian 09 program package. To simplify our calculations, long EO chains were replaced with three-repeating-unit groups, and this simplified method has been reported previously.27,28 Geometry optimizations were performed with a 6-31G* basis set, while the reported single-point energies have been obtained with a larger 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. For enhancing the accuracy of the weak interaction energy between molecules, basis set superposition error (BSSE) calculations were carried out through interaction energy calculations with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set.
