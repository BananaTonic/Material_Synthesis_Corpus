Sulfonated polyimide and PVDF based blend proton exchange membranes for fuel cell applications
Sulfonated polyimide (SPI) is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction and proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are prepared from the SPI/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) blends. Compared to commercial Nafion, the SPI/PVDF blend PEMs have significantly improved swelling ratio of &lt;3% (vs. ∼18% for Nafion), as well as high proton conductivity of 75 mS cm−1 for 50 wt% of SPI content (vs. ∼62 mS cm−1 for Nafion). The proton conducting mechanism in blend membrane was studied and dramatic increases in proton conductivity and water uptake at ∼30 wt% SPI were observed, which are proved by TEM to be due to the transition from isolated SPI ionic domains in PVDF matrix to a bi-continuous morphology – a percolation phenomenon.
