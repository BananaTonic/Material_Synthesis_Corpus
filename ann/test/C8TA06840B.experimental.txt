2.Experimental section
2.1.Synthesis of TOABr–Au NPs
Tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOABr)-stabilized Au nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of 8 nm were synthesized in toluene using a two-phase reaction.51 Gold(iii) chloride trihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water (30 mmol L−1, 30 mL) and TOABr in toluene (20 mmol L−1, 80 mL) were mixed under vigorous stirring. NaBH4 (Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water (0.4 mol L−1, 25 mL) was added to the above mixture. After 3 h, the mixture was repeatedly washed with H2SO4 (0.1 mol L−1), NaOH (0.1 mol L−1), and deionized water. TOABr–Au NPs in toluene were finally obtained after the separation of the aqueous solution.
2.2.Synthesis of OA–Fe3O4 NPs
Oleic acid (OA)-stabilized Fe3O4 NPs with a diameter of 7 nm were obtained in toluene through a thermal reaction.52 Fe(acac)3 (2 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,2-hexadecanediol (10 mmol, Alfa Aesar), oleylamine (6 mmol), OA (5 mmol), and benzyl ether (20 mL) were mixed and stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was heated to 200 °C for 2 h and then refluxed (∼300 °C) for 1 h. The black mixture was cooled to room temperature. Ethanol (40 mL) was added to the black solution, and the solid was separated via centrifugation. The product was dissolved in hexane containing OA (0.05 mL) and oleylamine (0.05 mL). OA–Fe3O4 NPs (black-brown powder) were obtained through repetitive purification of the product solution using centrifugation (6000 rpm, 10 min).
2.3.Synthesis of OA–MnO NPs
OA–MnO NPs with a diameter of 10 nm were obtained in toluene as previously reported.53 Manganese(ii) chloride tetrahydrate (40 mmol, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium oleate (80 mmol, TCI Co., Ltd.), ethanol (30 mL), n-hexane (70 mL), and deionized water (40 mL) were stirred at 70 °C for 12 h. Evaporation of the solution produced a Mn oleate powder (pink color). The Mn oleate powder (1.24 g) was mixed with 1-hexadecene (12.8 mL) at 70 °C for 1 h. The solution was then heated to 280 °C at a heating rate of 1.9 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained at that temperature for 10 min. The resultant solution was cooled to room temperature. OA–MnO NPs were obtained after purifying the solution using centrifugation.
2.4.Fabrication of the metallic cotton thread (MCT)
Commercial cotton thread with a diameter of 230 μm was dipped into a solution of tris(2-aminoethyl) amine (TREN) (Mw ∼ 146) in ethanol (1 mg mL−1) for 30 min, after which it was washed with pure ethanol to remove the weakly absorbed TREN and dried in air. The TREN-coated cotton thread was immersed in a solution of TOABr–Au NPs in toluene (10 mg mL−1) for 30 min, after which it was washed with pure toluene and dried in air. These procedures were repeated until the desired electrical conductivity was obtained.
2.5.Fabrication of the m-PC–Au NP/MCT electrode
The (TREN/pseudocapacitive NP)5 and (TREN/TOABr–Au NP)3 multilayers were alternatingly deposited onto the MCTs using the same LbL assembly method described above until the desired number (m) of pseudocapacitive NP layers was deposited.
2.6.Materials characterization
The crystallinity of the PC NPs was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM, Tecnai20). The adsorption mechanism of the LbL-assembled multilayers was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in specular mode (Cary 600 spectrometer, Agilent Technologies). The growth of the LbL-assembled multilayers was monitored using UV-Vis spectroscopy (Lambda 35, Perkin Elmer) and a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) (QCM 200, SRS). The mass change after each adsorption step was calculated from the change in the QCM frequency using the Sauerbrey equation.54 The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the MCT electrodes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Hitachi, S-4800). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted using an X-TOOL (ULVAC-PHI) equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV, 24.1 W, 15 kV).
2.7.Assembly of the solid-state MCT-ASC
The gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing Na2SO4 (1.7 g) with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (6 g) and deionized water (60 mL) at 90 °C for 1 h under vigorous stirring until the mixture became clear. The negative and positive electrodes were immersed in the cooled PVA/Na2SO4 gel for 5 min. Thereafter, the electrodes were placed parallel to each other and dried under ambient conditions until the gel solidified.
2.8.Electrochemical measurements
All the electrochemical measurements were performed with an Ivium-n-Stat system (Ivium Technologies). The electrochemical properties of the m-PC–Au NP/MCT and m-PC NP/MCT electrodes were evaluated in a three-electrode system composed of a Pt wire (counter) and Ag/AgCl (reference) electrode in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. EIS was performed over a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with a potential amplitude of 0.01 V.
2.9.Calculation of the electrochemical capacitance
The electrochemical capacitance (C) was calculated from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) or galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves using the following equations: C = ∫i(V)dV/2vΔV or C = IΔt/ΔV, where i is the current during the CV measurement, v is the scan rate of the CV curve, ΔV is the operating voltage window, I is the discharge current during GCD, and Δt is the discharge time during GCD. For the three electrode system, the areal capacitance (CA), volumetric capacitance (CV), length capacitance (CL), and mass capacitance (CM) were calculated according to the equations: CA = C/A, CV = C/V, CL = C/L, and CM = C/M, where A is the surface area, V is the volume, L is the length, and M is the mass of the whole electrode (cotton thread + active materials). A and V were calculated according to the equations: A = πD × L and V = π(D/2)2 × L, where D is the diameter of the electrodes. For the two electrode system, the capacitances (Ccell) of the asymmetric supercapacitor were calculated according to the equations: Ccell,A = C/Acell, Ccell,V = C/Vcell, Ccell,L = C/Lcell, and Ccell,M = C/Mcell, where Acell is the surface area, Vcell is the volume, Lcell is the length, and Mcell is the mass of the total device without the electrolyte. The coulombic efficiency (η) was calculated as: η = qd/qc = Itd/Itc, where qd and qc are the total amounts of discharge and charge of the capacitor from GCD, I is the current density, and td and tc are the discharge and charge times. Energy (E), power (P), and maximum power density (Pmax) were calculated from the galvanostatic discharge profiles using the following equations:55E = CΔV2/7200, P = E × 3600/Δt, and Pmax = V2/4RB, where C is the capacitance calculated from the galvanostatic discharge profiles and R is the resistance determined from ΔiR/2i. ΔiR is the voltage drop between the first two points, and i is the applied current in the galvanostatic discharge profile.
