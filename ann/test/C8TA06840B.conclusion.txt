4.Conclusions
We have demonstrated the fabrication of a high-performance stitchable 1D-ASC with remarkable energy/power density, fast rate capability, and good operational stability by using highly flexible, porous, and conductive MCTs coated with PC NP multilayers. In particular, the ligand-exchange LbL assembly of TOABr–Au NPs and TREN linkers vertically bridged all the interfaces between the Au and PC NPs, and between the cotton threads and Au NPs without the use of inactive polymer binders or linkers. This approach facilitated charge transport between neighboring NPs and furthermore provided systematic control of the interfacial structure and loading amount of Au and PC NPs. Therefore, the MCTs used in our system could serve as an excellent energy reservoir for integrating PC NPs and as a 1D substrate with metal-like conductivity. The periodic deposition of Au NPs into the PC NP multilayers with poor conductivity further enhanced the energy storage performance over that of the PC multilayers without Au NPs. The assembled 1D-ASCs with a structural design of (40-Fe3O4–Au NP/MCT)//(40-MnO NP–Au NP/MCT) exhibited a notable areal energy density of 80.7 μW h cm−2 (at 0.3 mA cm−2), exceeding those of the conventional thread-type ASCs reported to date. We revealed that this performance could be further enhanced by increasing the layer number (i.e., loading amount) of Au NPs and/or PC NPs. Considering the fact that low energy density is one of the most critical issues in the field of 1D-ASCs, our approach of using LbL-assembled MCTs can provide a basis for developing and designing high-performance 1D-ASCs and furthermore be widely applied in various electrochemical applications requiring flexibility.
