2.2Synthesis
2.2.1Synthesis of the potassium(4-carboxyl benzene sulphonyl)imide monomer (2)
Synthesis of bis(4-methy benzene sulphonyl)imide (1)
The synthesis of the bis(4-methy benzene sulphonyl)imide monomer (1) was achieved based on the Hinsberg reaction in previous work.26,27,42–45,50 Using aqueous media for the reaction of the highly reactive sulfonyl chloride, however, often results in significantly reduced reaction yields (about 40%) due to a high degree of side reactions. Therefore, the Einhorn reaction was performed in anhydrous pyridine. Equivalent molar ratios of p-toluenesulfon-amide (7.50 g, 43.80 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (8.45 g, 43.80 mmol) were dissolved in 10 ml of the solvent at 90 °C separately, and the p-toluenesulfonamide solution was stirred while the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride solution was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 hours (Fig. 2). Afterwards, using a Schlenk line and an additional cooling trap the solvent was vaporized under reduced pressure at 100 °C, a condition where unreacted p-toluenesulfonamide sublimed. The obtained product was washed with 500 ml of distilled water, filtered and dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 48 hours. A white powder was obtained with a yield of 69% (9.88 g). The absence of the signal in the 1H NMR spectrum corresponding to residual solvent (pyridine or H2O) or the reagent of the product indicates high purity of the bis(4-methy benzene sulphonyl)imide. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): 7.20 (d, 4H), 7.54 (d, 4H), and 2.33 (s, 6H); ESI−m/z: 325.04 (100%, (CH3–C6H4–SO2)2N−).

Synthesis of the potassium(4-carboxyl benzene sulphonyl)imide monomer (2)
Functionalization of the methyl end groups of bis(4-methy benzene sulphonyl)imide (1) was performed dissolving 9.50 g (29.15 mmol) of bis(4-methy benzene sulphonyl)imide (1) and 1 equivalent (0.6258 g, 29.15 mmol) LiOH·H2O in 500 ml of deionized water at 95 °C (Fig. 2). Then, 60.80 g of KMnO4 (3 eq., 87.45 mmol) were slowly added to the solution and the reaction solution was stirred for 12 hours under reflux. The solution was cooled down to 50 °C and MnO2 was filtered off, yielding a clear filtrate. Precipitation of the raw product from the filtrate was achieved by acidification with concentrated HCl (until pH = 1). The white precipitate was filtered off and washed with 1000 ml methanol, and then dried under vacuum at 100 °C, yielding 8.00 g of product (65%) (2). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6): 7.73 (d, 4H), 7.90 (d, 42H), and 13.15 (s, 2H); ESI−m/z: 384.99 (100%, (COOH–C6H4–SO2)2N−).
2.2.2Polycondensation
Polycondensation of 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)dianiline and potassium(4-carboxyl benzene sulphonyl)imide (2) was performed as described elsewhere.51,52 8.4 ml of pyridine, 30 ml of NMP, 2.16 g of calcium chloride (19.4 mmol), 8.42 ml TPP (32.12 mmol), 2.51 g (6.02 mmol) 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)dianiline, and 3.12 g (6.02 mmol) potassium(4-carboxyl benzene sulphonyl)imide, were added subsequently to a 100 ml round-bottom flask under an argon atmosphere. The solution was heated to 110 °C and the reaction continued under stirring for 7 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature (approximately 25 °C) and precipitated by dropwise addition into 1000 ml of methanol in an ice bath. The yield of the final substance (3) was 95% (5.09 g).
2.2.3Ion substitution
Substitution of potassium with hydrogen ions was achieved by dissolving 5 g of the polymer (3) in 30 ml DMSO and subsequent precipitation by addition of concentrated HCl. The precipitate was filtered and washed well with 500 ml of deionized water; this process was repeated one more time and full exchange of potassium with hydrogen was confirmed by total reflection X-ray fluorescence analysis (TXRF, K &lt; 0.05%, Cl not detected). The yield of (4) was 95% (4.5 g).
Lithiation of the polymer (4)
The preparation of lithiated polymers based on the polysulfonamide monomer was often achieved upon application of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) in previous reports,26,27,40–47 despite the fact that the corresponding 1H NMR spectra of the polymers exhibited significant signals at 3.33 pm, clearly indicating the unintentional presence of either unreacted LiOH or residual water. Since the fluorinated single ion conducting polymer introduced in this work shows good solubility in THF compared to polysulfonamides containing other functional groups, successful lithiation was achieved with 1 M lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. 1.1 g polymer (4) was dissolved in 300 ml anhydrous THF under an argon atmosphere and 1 eq. (1.61 ml) of the lithium base was added dropwise so that the lithiated product precipitated from the reaction solution. The reaction solution was allowed to stir overnight and the lithiated polymer (5) was collected after removing the solvent and bis(trimethylsilyl)amine under reduced pressure at 80 °C. The yield was 1.09 g (98%). Full lithiation was confirmed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The corresponding 1H NMR spectrum of (5) (Fig. 3) showed four doublet signals at 7.35 ppm, 7.84 ppm, 7.91 ppm and 7.97 ppm attributed to aromatic compounds, and a singlet at 10.59 ppm related to CO–NH coupling of the monomers. The ratio of the integrated peak areas of the coupling proton to aromatic compounds was 1 : 8.4 (theoretically: 1 : 8). The absence of further signals confirmed the rather high purity and successful removal of solvents.

2.3Preparation of the single ion conducting polymer electrolyte membrane
Four different membrane compositions were made, where the actual amount of lithiated polymer increased in order to obtain membranes with good ionic conductivity and sufficient mechanical flexibility. Weight ratios of 1 : 1, 3 : 5, 2 : 6 and 1 : 7, respectively, of PVdF-HFP to lithiated polymer were considered. For each membrane, a total amount of 400 mg of polymer (5) was dissolved in 4 ml NMP at 60 °C. The solution was cast in a Petri dish and placed into a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight yielding a homogeneous polymer membrane of about 80 μm thickness. Disks of 12 or 13 mm diameter were cut from the membrane and further dried for 48 hours at 100 °C under vacuum prior to soaking them with EC : PC (1 : 1, v/v) solvent solution. EC : PC (1 : 1, v/v) was selected due to its superior thermal stability compared to other solvent mixtures used for battery applications, containing a linear carbonate compound such as e.g. diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) or ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC).53 The weight of the membranes was measured after removing the residual liquid on the surface of the polymer film. The corresponding solvent uptake (SU) was derived from the following equation:1with ws and w0 denoting the weight of the swollen and dry membranes, respectively.
2.4Preparation of the cathode
For the preparation of LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NMC111) containing cathode material, 0.132 g (3 wt%) PVdF was dissolved in 6 ml NMP and stirred overnight. Subsequently, 0.132 g (3 wt%) of carbon black, 0.132 g (3 wt%) of lithiated terephthalic acid and 4 g (91 wt%) of NMC were added and the viscous solution was transferred to a swing mill MM 400 (Retsch Technology, Haan, Germany) stirring for 30 min at a frequency of 30 Hz. The slurry was then cast onto an aluminum current collector using a doctor blade technique at a gap width of 50 μm. The obtained coating was dried at 80 °C overnight, followed by further drying at 80 °C under vacuum. The electrodes were calendered using a roll press. The thickness of the two rolls was decreased from the initial thickness of the electrodes (current collector + coating (20 μm + 26 μm = 46 μm)) down to the thickness of the current collector + half of the initial coating thickness in two steps (to 20 μm + 13 μm = 33 μm), thereby reaching a compression of the coating of 50%. The final electrode coating thickness was 13 ± 1 μm and the mass loading was 2.8 mg cm−2.
2.5Methods
2.5.1Material characterization
1H NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER 400 AVANCE III HD instrument using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as the reference signal. Pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR) data were acquired on a BRUKER 200 AVANCE III spectrometer equipped with a (doubly tuned 7Li/1H) 5 mm coil at either 20 °C or 40 °C (±0.1 °C). A 0.25 M LiCl in H2O solution was utilized for external calibration at 0 ppm. The gradient strength g was varied from 35–1050 G cm−1 averaging up to 4750 scans with a gradient pulse length δ of 1 ms and diffusion time Δ of 40 ms. The self-diffusion coefficients D of the lithium species were derived from a stimulated echo sequence (“diffSte”) after fitting the attenuated signal amplitude to the Stejskal–Tanner equation, which describes the case of rather ideal (“free”) isotropic diffusion:2with I being the signal intensity, I0 the initial signal in the absence of a magnetic field gradient and γ the gyromagnetic ratio. Data analysis was done with BRUKER Topspin 3.5 and BRUKER Dynamics Center 2.5. For the measurement, the swollen membrane (exemplarily shown in Fig. 4a) was placed into a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube (bottom part was cut open). Teflon tape was added above and below the SIPE, while the polymer electrolyte was gently pushed inside the tube. The PTFE tube was placed inside a 5 mm diameter glass tube (Fig. 4b).

ICP-OES measurements were performed using a Spectro ARCOS EOP device (Spectro Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany) after having the polymer dissolved using a microwave-assisted acid digestion (Anton Paar Multiwave Pro, Graz, Austria).
For total reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) measurements, a Picofox S2 system equipped with Spectra 7.5 software (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) was used. The polymer sample was placed on a quartz glass carrier from Bruker Corporation.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Q5000IR instrument (TA Instruments) applying a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 700 °C under an oxygen gas atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted between −150 °C and 150 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 on a Q2000 device (TA Instruments).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the morphology (surface and cross section) of the polymer membranes. Cross sections were prepared by immersing the samples in liquid nitrogen and breaking the membranes. Multiple areas per sample were analyzed on an Auriga CrossBeam workstation from Zeiss (Germany) at an acceleration voltage of 3 kV.
2.5.2Electrochemical investigations
Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted between −40 °C and 80 °C in steps of 10 °C applying a NOVOCONTROL alpha-S-spectrometer. Impedance spectra were measured applying an alternating voltage signal having an amplitude of 5 mV over a frequency range from 10−1 to 4 × 107 Hz. A coin cell setup was used where the swollen membrane (12 mm diameter) was placed between two stainless steel electrodes. DC conductivity values were extracted from the plateau region of the frequency-dependent real part of the complex conductivity. A temperature ramp was applied from 20 °C to 80 °C, down to −40 °C and back to 80 °C. This temperature ramp was performed twice and demonstrated reversible behavior.
The lithium-ion transference number (tLi+) was determined using the combined potentiostatic polarization and complex impedance measurement technique proposed by Evans et al.54 The membrane was sandwiched between two non-blocking lithium metal electrodes and the symmetrical cell was measured at 40 °C using an Autolab PGSTAT302N (Metrohm, Modul: FRA V2.0, Nova-Software 1.6). Impedance spectra were collected between 1 Hz and 2 GHz and a DC polarization voltage ΔV of 10 mV was applied across the sample. Subsequently, the lithium ion transference number was determined by3with IO and IS the initial and steady state current, respectively. RO and RS are the initial and steady state resistances of the interfaces.
The electrochemical stability of the polymer blend was determined using a VSP instrument (Bio-Logic Science Instruments). Measurements were conducted in a three electrode cell setup using lithium as the counter and reference electrode and platinum or copper as the working electrode for oxidative or reductive stability, respectively. A scan rate of 80 μV s−1 was applied in the potential range between −0.5 V and 6 V (vs. Li/Li+).
Cycling investigations were performed on a Maccor 4000 battery analysis system (USA) between 3.0 V and 4.3 V vs. Li/Li+ (constant current charging, CC), while the cells are at constant temperature in a climatic chamber, at either 60 °C or 20 °C, respectively.
