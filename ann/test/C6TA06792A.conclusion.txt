3.Conclusions
In summary, by using a simple aqueous solution reaction at RT, we prepared a 3D oxalate-based Eu-MOF 1. Industrial implementation of 1 can be readily carried out by using cheap starting materials with a quantitative yield. 1 possesses an extensive hydrogen-bonded network, which is attributed to the observed high proton conductivity and the high water stability. 1 also shows a highly sensitive luminescence sensing of Cu2+ ions in aqueous solutions. It is demonstrated herein that the synthesis of multifunctional MOF materials should be simple, efficient, scalable and cost effective. This result may offer a general method to synthesize promising proton conductive MOF materials.
