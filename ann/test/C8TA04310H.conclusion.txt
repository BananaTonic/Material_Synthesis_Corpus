3.Conclusions
The effect of aliphatic side chain length on the properties of QPAF membranes was investigated in detail. The interstitial aliphatic groups between the polymer main chains and the ammonium groups improved the solubility and flexibility of the resulting QPAF-Cx membranes compared to our previous benzylammonium-type QPAF-C1 and -C1B membranes. Introducing side chains with C3 and longer contributed to the well-developed phase-separated morphology as confirmed by the TEM images and SAXS measurements. The longer side chains caused higher water affinity, and this effect was more pronounced with C4 and longer. The hydroxide ion conductivity exhibited a similar dependence on the side chain length and water uptake, suggesting that ion conduction was dominated by the absorbed water molecules in the hydrophilic domains. The QPAF-C3 membrane achieved the balanced properties of high ion conductivity with low water uptake. There seemed an odd/even effect of the side chain length on mechanical properties, lower thermal transition temperature and higher elongation at break for the polymer membranes with odd-numbered carbon side chains. The QPAF-C3 and -C4 membranes exhibited alkaline stability for a long time under harsh alkaline conditions (1 M and 4 M KOH at 80 °C), whereas the membranes with longer side chains did not survive due to excess swelling. In 8 M KOH, however, the QPAF-C3 and -C4 membranes showed a gradual loss in the conductivity. The post-test NMR, titration, and TEM analyses revealed that minor chemical degradation and some morphological changes seemed responsible for the loss in the conductivity. An H2/O2 fuel cell with the QPAF-C3 membrane exhibited a high power density of 224 mW cm−2 which was higher than those with our previous QPAF-C1 and Tokuyama A201 membranes. QPAF-C3 maintained 69% of its initial voltage after the 62 h fuel cell durability test which was also superior to Tokuyama A201 (52% remaining voltage). The voltage loss in QPAF-C3 was attributed to the electrode binder degradation and/or morphological relaxation but not structural degradation as confirmed by post-test NMR analyses. These results suggest that introducing interstitial aliphatic side chains caused a significant improvement not only in the alkaline stability of the membranes but also in the cell performance and durability.
