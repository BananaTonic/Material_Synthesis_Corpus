4.Conclusions
In this work, a 3D-BGPE rich in boron ester with a 3D cross-linked polymer structure has been successfully fabricated by an in situ strategy, where the linear chains of the LBC greatly accelerate Li+ transfer, while the branched TBC mainly acts as a cross-linking structure. The optimized 3D-BGPE exhibits a prominent ionic conductivity of 8.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C, a high Li+ transference number of 0.76, a wide potential window up to 4.52 V and superior mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 7.6 MPa. The Li/3D-BGPE/Li symmetric cell maintains an extremely stable and low overpotential without short circuiting over 1000 h. The LiFePO4/3D-BGPE/Li cell achieves 89.73% capacity retention after cycling for 400 cycles.
