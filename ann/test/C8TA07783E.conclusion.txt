4.Conclusions
Polycrystalline Na0.03Sn0.97Se samples were prepared by hot pressing (HP) and hot deformation (HD) methods. From the XRD and SEM results, the hot deformation process enhanced the textured degree of the polycrystalline sample, where the grains were orientated along the (400) plane in the direction perpendicular to the pressure. Moreover, the intensity of the (210) plane increases significantly in the XRD patterns of Na0.03Sn0.97Se samples. Owing to the texture modification and electrical conductivity enhancement, the power factor reaches 10.2 μW cm−1 K−2 at 823 K for HD samples, which is the highest value reported so far. Thus, the maximum ZT reached ∼1.3 at 793 K for the hot deformed sample. This study shows that orientation modification can increase the electrical properties of the polycrystalline SnSe system, leading to the enhancement in the thermoelectric performances.
