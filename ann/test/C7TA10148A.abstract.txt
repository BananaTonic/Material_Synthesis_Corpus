A new Zr(iv)-based metal–organic framework, termed VNU-23 [Zr6O8(H2O)8(H2SNDC)4], where H2SNDC2− = 4,8-disulfonaphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate, was synthesized. Subsequently, detailed structural analysis revealed that VNU-23 adopted the bcu topology with a structure characterized by densely packed sulfonic acid groups lining 6 Å channels. With this structural feature, an anchoring strategy was employed to dock the proton transfer agent, histamine, into the void space of VNU-23 to enhance the proton conductivity. Remarkably, the proton conductivity of this material reached 1.79 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 95 °C and 85% relative humidity without any appreciable loss of performance for at least 120 h.
