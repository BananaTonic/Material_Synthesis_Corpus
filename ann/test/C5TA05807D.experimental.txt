2.1Materials
P(VDF-TrFE) (Mw = 200 000 g mol−1) powder was purchased from Solway, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) was purchased from Aldrich. PVP (Mw = 40 000 g mol−1) was purchased from Junsei Chemical, in powder form. PSSA (Aldrich, Mw = 75 000 g mol−1, liquid form) was used as the polyelectrolyte, and the IEC of PSSA was estimated to be around 4.4 meq g−1.8 Tetraammineplatinum(ii) chloride hydrate, [Pt(NH3)4]Cl2·H2O, was purchased from Aldrich. Sodium borohydride, lithium chloride, hydroxylammonium chloride, hydrochloric acid, and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from DAE-JUNG. Hydrazine monohydrate was obtained from YAKURI.
2.2Synthesis of the blend membrane
For fabrication of the ionic polymer blend membrane, P(VDF-TrFE), PVP, and PSSA with different concentrations were dissolved in DMF to form a 10 weight (wt)% solution. The blend solution was cast onto a glass Petri dish. It was kept under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h and then at 100 °C for 12 h to remove the solvent. After cooling the glass Petri dish, the membrane was stripped off from the glass Petri dish and immersed in water for 24 h to saturate the matrix with water.
2.3Synthesis of the IPMNC
In dry conditions, the upper and lower surfaces of the ionic membranes were sandblasted to increase the interfacial area density of both surfaces between the ionic polymer and the Pt electrode. For fabrication of the IPMNC actuator, nano-sized platinum (Pt) particles were deposited on both sides of the P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA membrane, using an electroless plating process, as reported previously.34,35 After fabrication of the IPMNC, it was immersed in LiCl for 24 h for the ionic exchange process. The IPMNC samples were kept in deionized water (D.I.) for actuation measurements.
2.4Characterization
Characterization of the dry P(VDF-TrFE)/PVP/PSSA membranes was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis (S-4700, Hitachi). SEM images were captured for both surfaces and cross-sections of the samples. All the samples were coated with gold using a sputter prior to the SEM measurements. The morphology of the membranes was also characterized using field emission (FE) cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (JEM-2100F, JEOL). The sample preparation for TEM microscopy consisted of embedding membranes in an epoxy embedding mixture followed by ultra-microtomy with a diamond knife to obtain thin samples. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) tests were carried out (IR Prestige-21, Shimadzu) and samples were prepared in KBr (potassium bromide). The crystal structure of the blend membranes was analyzed using X-ray diffraction with Cu Kα radiation (D8 Advance, Bruker). The water uptake was determined with the same method as reported previously.34 The IEC of the prepared ionic membranes was measured using the titration method, as previously reported.35 Proton conductivities of the ionic membranes were measured by AC impedance (CHI 6600D, CH instruments). For this measurement, the blend membranes were cut into a circle with an area of 1.76 cm2, and immersed in deionized water overnight in order to obtain a fully hydrated membrane. The blend membrane samples were placed between the two electrodes in the Teflon-coated stainless steel cell. The proton conductivity of the blend membranes was measured using the following formula:25,40–42 proton conductivity (S cm−1) = L/R × A, where L is the thickness of the blend membrane in cm, R is the ohmic resistance of the blend membrane in Ω, and A is the surface area of the blend membrane in cm2. The proton conductivity of the Nafion membrane was also measured using the same method. The Young's moduli, tensile strengths, and tensile strains of both the hydrated blend membranes were measured using a universal testing machine (AGS-X+250, Shimadzu) equipped with a 1 kN load cell. The test speed was set to a rate of 10 mm min−1.
2.5Measurement
For the actuation tests, the IPMNC sheet was cut into strips with dimensions of 5 mm in width and 30 mm in length. The experimental setup was composed of a laser displacement measurement system (LK-031, Keyence) and a National Instruments PXI system. For short periods of actuation (100 s) in hydrated (under water) and dry (in air) conditions under DC and AC voltages, the actuation displacement was measured from 15 mm away from the gripper, where one part of the IPMNC (5 mm) was gripped. For long periods of actuation (2000 and 4500 s) in hydrated (under water) and dry (in air) conditions, the actuation displacement was measured from 10 mm away from the gripper in order to avoid deviation of the laser beam from the IPMNC sample. It should be noted that our IPMNC starts bending during longer periods of actuation, making it difficult to measure the displacement from the tip part. Prior to actuation measurements in dry conditions, D.I. water on the IPMNC surface was removed gently with tissue paper and then the IPMNC sample was sandwiched between two electrodes for the actuation measurement. For the actuation displacement under DC voltages, the displacement of the actuator was measured from the initial position of the IPMNC to the maximum displacement of the IPMNC. In order to estimate the actuation displacement under AC voltages, the mean actuation displacement (δ) in one cycle was calculated by using the following formula,1where δmax and δmin represent the maximum and the minimum values of the actuation displacement in one cycle, respectively. The average values of the actuation displacements were obtained from three experimental results. The normalized displacement of the IPMNC was calculated using the ratio of the actuation displacement to the distance of the IPMNC from the gripper (distance from gripper to laser beam). The measurement of the actuation force was carried out by using a load cell (LVS-5GA, KYOWA) at a DC voltage of 1 V in dry (in air) conditions. The tip parts of the IPMNC actuators were directly connected to the microload cell, and the DC voltage of 1 V was applied to measure the actuation force. The average value was taken from three experimental results as well. The surface resistance of the IPMNC samples between two points was measured with a digital multi-meter. The distance between the two points was approximately 1 cm. The average value out of ten measurements was taken and is mentioned in the paper. The thickness of the IPMNC actuators for the actuation measurement was 0.18 mm and the breakdown strength of the IPMNC samples was 44.4 V mm−1.
