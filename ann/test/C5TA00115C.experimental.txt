Experimental section
All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich or VWR International, and used without purification. Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2,6(3H,7H)-dione was prepared according to literature procedures.9 UV-vis spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-9 spectrophotometer. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker AV500 spectrometers operating at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, in deuterated chloroform solution referenced to TMS. Mass spectrometry data was collected on a Bruker Esquire mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization. Thermal transitions were measured on a TA Instruments Q20-1066 Differential Scanning Calorimeter with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
Cyclic voltammetry of the films was conducted in acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate using a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. An ITO, Ag/AgCl, and Pt mesh were used as the working electrode, reference electrode, and counter electrode, respectively. The wide angle X-ray diffraction pattern was obtained by a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer. The polar optical microscopy image was recorder by a Leica DM 4500 P polarizing microscope, and the optical orientation images was recorded by a video CCD camera (IK-M48PK Toshiba, single-chip color camera) attached to the microscope (Reichert Zetopan) with a camera-rotating polarizer unit and a circular polarizer.42 AFM images under tapping mode were taken on a Veeco multimode AFM with a Nanoscope III controller.
Fabrication and characterization of OTFT devices
The field-effect transistors based on two LCs were fabricated using the top-contact and bottom-gate geometry. Heavily doped n-type silicon substrates with a 300 nm thermal oxide layer were purchased from the Montco Silicon Technologies Inc. After cleaning the substrate by sequential ultrasonication in acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min followed by air plasma treatment, the oxide layer was passivated with a thin BCB buffer layer. 1 wt% BCB precursor solution in toluene was spun onto the silicon oxide at 4000 rpm and subsequently annealed at 250 °C overnight. The total capacitance density measured from parallel-plate capacitors was 10.6 nF cm−2. The different LC films were spin-coated chloroform solution. The thickness of the films is around 30 nm estimated from AFM measurement, and the blending films were considered as a single-layer for conductivity calculation. Interdigitated source and drain electrodes (W = 1000 μm, L = 20 μm) were defined by evaporating a layer of Ag (50 nm) through a shadow mask at 10−7 Torr. OFET characterization was carried out in a N2-filled glovebox using an Agilent 4155B semiconductor parameter S6 analyzer. The field-effect mobility was calculated from the linear fit of (IDS)1/2vs. VGS in the saturation regime. The threshold voltage (Vt) was estimated as the x intercept of the linear section of the plot of (IDS)1/2vs. VGS. Conductivities were measured in the N2 glove box and derived from gated two-terminal measurements at zero gate voltage with the equation of σ = (L/A)(IDS/VDS), where L (m) and A (m2) are the channel length and cross-sectional area of the devices,24,28 respectively.
