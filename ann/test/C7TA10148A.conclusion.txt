4.Conclusion
In summary, we have succeeded in synthesizing and characterizing a new Zr-based MOF, termed VNU-23. Through structural analysis, VNU-23 was found to adopt the bcu architecture, characterized by Brønsted acid lining 6 Å channels. Following this, an anchoring strategy was employed to dope histamine into the void space of VNU-23 to form His8.2⊂VNU-23. As a result of this structural feature, His8.2⊂VNU-23 exhibited high proton conductivity (1.79 × 10−2 S cm−1) under practical conditions of 85% RH and 95 °C with the proton conductivity retained without any loss for at least 120 h.
