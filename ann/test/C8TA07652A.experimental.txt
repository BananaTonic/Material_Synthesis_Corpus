2.1Synthesis of Li6.28La3Zr2Al0.24O12 (LLZA)
A high Li+ conductive cubic phase (Ia3̄d) Li6.28La3Zr2Al0.24O12 (LLZA) lithium garnet was synthesized by the solid-state reaction using the following reactants: lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH·H2O, Kanto Chemicals, 98%) (10 wt% excess LiOH·H2O was added to compensate lithium loss during high temperature sintering), preheated lanthanum oxide (La2O3, High Purity Chemicals, 99.9%), aluminum oxide (Al2O3, High Purity Chemicals, 99.9%) and zirconium oxide (ZrO2, Wako). Stoichiometric amounts of the reactants were thoroughly ball milled in 2-propanol for 12 h. After evaporation of the solvent, the grounded powder was calcined at 950 °C for 12 h in air. The calcined powder was again wet ball milled for 24 h and dried. The dried powder was pressed into pellets and sintered at 1200 °C for 12 h with sufficient amounts of mother powder covering the pellets to mitigate the lithium loss during sintering. After sintering, LLZA pellets were removed from the mother powder and then polished with 400 and 1200 grit sand paper to control the thickness (∼500 μm) and to produce a smooth surface.
2.2Synthesis of lithium silicate
The Li2SiO3 sols were prepared from lithium ethoxide [Li(OEt), High Purity Chemicals, 99.9%] and tetraethoxysilane [TEOS, Shin Etsu, 99%] precursors with an atomic ratio of 2 : 1 (Li : Si) by the sol–gel process.33 Ethanol was used as the solvent. Stoichiometric amounts of Li(OEt) and TEOS were added to ethanol solution in separate beakers, and were kept under stirring for 2 h. After homogeneous mixing of the precursor solution in ethanol, the TEOS solution was added to Li(OEt) under stirring. After 1 h of stirring, hydrolysis was performed by adding a stoichiometric amount of water as 0.1 M HCl.
2.3Preparation of PVdF/PEO polymer blend mat by electrospin
PVdF (Sigma Aldrich, Mw = 53 400) and PEO (Sigma Aldrich, Mw = 500 000) were vacuum dried at 60 °C overnight before use. Solvents, acetone and dimethylformamide (DMF) were used as received. A uniform solution of PVdF (90%) and PEO (10%) in a mixed solvent of acetone/DMF (7 : 3) was prepared by magnetic stirring for 15 h at room temperature. The polymer/solvent ratio for the final solution was kept at 7 wt% solid content. A sufficient amount of solution was fed to a 10 mm syringe and the tip of the syringe was connected to a high voltage source. The spun fibers were collected on a grounded, aluminum wrapped plate. Further, the polymer blend mat was dried at room temperature on the drum followed by vacuum drying at 60 °C for 12 h to remove any trace of the solvent.
2.4Preparation of composite cathode
The pristine NMC [NMC(P)] powder and Li2SiO3 sol were dispersed in the N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent in a mass ratio 70 : 30 and the total concentration was maintained to be 10 mg mL−1. The particles in the solution were dispersed by ultra-sonication for 2 h and were drop coated onto the surface of Li2SiO3 coated LLZA (LS-LLZA). The amount of dropped solution was controlled to achieve ∼2 mg cm−2 active material loading. After dropping, the solvent was evaporated at 300 °C on a hot plate to achieve a composite cathode||LLZA combined structure with an interconnected Li2SiO3 buffer layer. After drying, 0.5 mg cm−2, acetylene black (AB) dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was dropped on the cathode and dried to achieve the current collector.
2.5Symmetric cells
LLZA pellets were polished with different grit sized sandpaper to smoothen the surface and also to remove any contamination from the pellet surface. The following symmetric cells were fabricated in Swagelok type cells to study the interface between LLZA and the electrode:
(1) NMC(P)||LLZA||NMC(P): the NMC particles were dispersed in NMP solvent with a total concentration maintained to be 10 mg mL−1. The symmetric cell was fabricated by directly coating pristine NMC particles [NMC(P)] dispersed in the NMP solvent over either side of a well-polished LLZA pellet, followed by heat treatment at 300 °C to remove the solvent. Acetylene black dispersed in NMP was dropped and dried on the cathodes to achieve a current collector.
(2) NMC||LLZA||NMC: the symmetric cell was fabricated by coating the composite cathode i.e. NMC : LS (70 : 30) [we have denoted the composite cathode as NMC] over a pristine LLZA pellet followed by heat treatment on either side in sequence to remove the solvent. Acetylene black dispersed in NMP was dropped and dried on the cathodes to achieve a current collector.
(3) NMC||LS-LLZA-LS||NMC: to prepare the NMC||LS-LLZA-LS||NMC symmetric cell, a thin buffer layer of Li2SiO3 was coated above LLZA prior to NMC coating. For coating a thin layer of Li2SiO3, a small amount of the as-prepared Li2SiO3 sol was drop coated on either side of LLZA and was then heat treated at 300 °C to remove the solvent to form the LS-LLZA-LS combined structure. The density of the prepared Li2SiO3 sol was 3.54 g L−1 and the average thickness of Li2SiO3 coating over LLZA was estimated to be ∼0.5 μm. From the volume and density of Li2SiO3, the mass of Li2SiO3 coating was calculated to be 35.4 μg. NMC was coated on the LS-LLZA-LS structure by a drop casting technique, and the coating was done till the complete surface of LS-LLZA was covered. Later on, the NMC||LS-LLZA-LS structure was dried at 300 °C to remove the solvent under air conditions. This was carried out in sequence on either side to form the NMC||LS-LLZA-LS||NMC structure.
(4) Li||GPE|LLZA||GPE||Li: lithium metal electrodes were punched from the lithium belt into round disks and the surface was scratched to remove the oxide coating. The electrospunned PVdf–PEO polymer mat was cut smaller than the size of the LLZA pellet. A minimal amount of the liquid electrolyte (1.0 M LiPF6 in DMC) was poured on to the mat to make it a transparent gel polymer electrolyte (GPE). The symmetric cells were fabricated by placing the GPE between lithium and the LLZA pellet.
2.6Battery fabrication
The surface of the LLZA pellets were polished and cleaned well before fabricating the battery. The procedure for engineering the surface of LLZA at the cathode side was the same for both all-solid-state battery and quasi-solid-state battery. Initially one side of the LLZA pellet surface was coated with Li2SiO3 by drop casting Li2SiO3 over the LLZA surface, followed by heat treatment at 300 °C to remove the solvent. Later on, the composite cathode was drop cast over the Li2SiO3 coated LLZA surface (LS-LLZA) until the complete surface of LS-LLZA was covered with NMC. Afterwards the solvent was evaporated at 300 °C to achieve the NMC||LS-LLZA combined structure.
(1) All-solid-state battery: the NMC||LS-LLZA combined structure was utilized for battery fabrication by melting lithium on the other side of the LLZA pellet with a thin gold (Au) interface to improve the wettability.18 The cells were assembled in a Swagelok type cell and were heat treated at 180 °C for 1 hour for the formation of a Li–Au alloy to enhance the interfacial contact between lithium and the LLZA pellet. The complete fabrication of the all-solid-state battery (NMC||LS-LLZ||Au||Li) was carried out inside an argon filled glove box.
(2) Quasi-solid-state battery: in the case of a quasi-solid-state battery, the contact between LLZA and lithium metal was improved by placing a GPE layer in between them. Lithium was punched into a circular disc and the surface was scratched to remove oxide coating. The prepared polymer mat was cut smaller than the size of theLLZA pellet to prevent leaching of the liquid electrolyte to the cathode side and a controlled amount of the liquid electrolyte (5 μL) was poured above the polymer mat to make it a transparent gel and was placed in between the LLZA pellet and lithium metal to improve the contact. The Li||GPE||LLZA-LS||NMC cells were assembled in CR2032 coin cell cases inside an argon filled glove box.
2.7Characterization
Crystal phase analysis of the LLZA, composite cathode and LS-LLZA after heat-treatment at 300 °C was carried out by by XRD (X'pert PRO PANalytical) using Cu Kα radiation of λ = 1.5418 Å in the 2θ range from 10 to 80°. The Raman spectrum of the garnet surface was measured (Renishaw in via Reflex spectrometer) at room temperature with a 50 mW internal Ar+ laser source of excitation wavelength 514 nm. The density of the pellet was determined from the physical dimension and weight of the sample using the Archimedes principle. The morphologies of the interfaces and surface were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (Miniscope® TM3030Plus, Hitachi).
2.7.1Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, galvanostatic cycling with potential limitation tests and cyclic voltammetry were carried out with a Bio-Logic VMP 3, SI 1260 Solartron and 580 battery type system, Scribner Associates. The two sides of the LLZA pellet were sputtered with Au to form a blocking electrode for the ionic conductivity measurement. EIS measurements were carried out over the frequency range of 1 MHz–1 Hz at a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV. Constant current cycling of the Li||GPE||LLZA||GPE||Li symmetric cell was conducted with a current density of 0.4 mA cm−2 over a period of ∼0.2 h. For the all-solid-state battery, the temperature was controlled at 100 °C by placing the battery in a temperature chamber and the cell was cycled with a constant current of 10 μA cm−2 in the voltage range of 2–4.5 V. For the quasi-solid-state battery, the cell was cycled with different current densities of 50 μA cm−2 and 100 μA cm−2 in the voltage range of 2.0–4.5 V at room temperature (25 °C). To check the stability of the composite cathode, a CV scan was performed in a voltage range of 2.0–4.6 V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.
