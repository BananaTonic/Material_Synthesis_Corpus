Materials and methods
All the commercial chemical reagents were used without further purification. The main reagents were: PA (Aladdin Reagents, 90% used for biology), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) (Sigma-Aldrich), PVA [Sigma-Aldrich, 99% hydrolysed, average molecular weight (Mw) = 86 000–89 000]. Elemental analyses were obtained using a PerkinElmer 240 analyser. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed under a normal atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a PerkinElmer thermogravimetric analyser from 30 °C to 800 °C. Powder X-ray-diffraction (PXRD) analyses were acquired on a Rigaku D/Max 2550 diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 50 kV, 200 mA.
Synthesis of JUC-200
Typically for the synthesis procedure, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (78 mg, 0.26 mmol) and PA (66 mg, 0.1 mmol) were added to a mixed solvent of water–methanol–dimethyl formamide (DMF; 4 mL : 2.4 mL : 0.6 mL, respectively). A clear solution was yielded by adding 0.28 mL nitric acid (HNO3; 2 mol L−1). After solvent evaporation at room temperature for one week, colourless crystals were obtained with a yield of 68% (based on the ligand) and this compound was named JUC-200 [Zn10(C6H8P6O24)2(H2O)14·x(H2O)]. It was collected by filtration and washed with water. Then the crystal was immersed in pure water for three days. The water was changed every 8 h. Then it was dried at ambient conditions. Element analysis (%) was calculated for Zn10(C6H8P6O24)2(H2O)14: C, 6.53; H, 1.99; found: C, 5.50; H, 2.59.
Synthesis of JUC-200@PVA composite membranes
A conventional solution casting technique was carried out to prepare the composite membranes with different contents of JUC-200 particles (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 wt%). PVA (0.5 g) was dissolved in 7 mL of boiling water under stirring. After three hours, a clear solution was obtained. JUC-200 was sufficiently ground in an adequate amount of water until there was a micron-sized powder. Afterwards, a certain amount of the JUC-200 powder was added to the PVA solution, and then stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The mixed solution was dripped onto actinic glass panes and dried at room temperature for 3 to 5 days. A series of composite membranes were obtained named JUC-200@PVA-X (X = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50), X was the weight percentage ratio of the JUC-200 micron-sized powder compared with the PVA weight.
Single crystal X-ray crystallography
Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected at 293 K on a Bruker APEX II charged coupled device (CCD) diffractometer (Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å). Indexing was performed using APEX2 (difference vectors method) software. Data integration and reduction were performed using SaintPlus software. An empirical absorption correction was performed using a multiscan method using the SADABS program.61 Structures were solved and refined using SHELXL-2014 (direct methods and full-matrix least-squares on F2). Hydrogen atoms on carbon were calculated in ideal positions with isotropic placement parameters set to 1.2 × Ueq of the attached atoms. In the structure, some free solvent molecules were solved, and locating and refining the solvent peaks was attempted. Because of the abundant disordered water molecules in JUC-200, their diffraction contribution was removed by using PLATON/SQUEEZE procedure.62,63 The guest molecules were calculated from the TGA results.
Proton conductivity
Pellets of JUC-200 with a diameter of 6 mm and a thickness of 0.25–0.3 mm were prepared by pressing the powder material (about 100 mg) at 40 kN cm−2. The proton conductivities of the pellets and the membranes were measured using a Princeton Applied Research PARSTAT 2273 potentiostat. A frequency from 1 MHz to 100 Hz, 10 mV alternating currents (AC) perturbations and 0.0 V direct current (DC) rest voltage were used during the test. Prior to the measurements, the measuring cell with the samples was placed in a container with relative humidity (RH) levels and placed in the required temperature for a certain time. The saturated salt solutions of magnesium chloride (MgCl2; ∼33% RH), magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2; ∼53% RH), sodium nitrite (NaNO2; ∼65% RH), sodium chloride (NaCl; ∼75% RH) and potassium sulfate (K2SO4; ∼97% RH) were used to act as the humidity source. These solutions were put into the containers for three days to ensure that the air reached an equilibrium state. The sample pellets were covered with silver paint to make sure the surface area was tested and to improve the contact with the electrodes. The conductivity (σ, S cm−1) was calculated using the relationship: σ = L/(RA), where R (Ω) is the sample resistance estimated by an extrapolation of the high frequency arc crossing to the axis,64L (cm) is the thickness tested by the micrometer caliper and A (cm2) is the face area.
