Synthesis of (2-oxo-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl 2-(trifluoromethyl)acrylate (MAF-cyCB)
The compound 2-trifluoromethyl acrylic acid (MAF) was converted into 2-(trifluoromethyl)acryloyl chloride (MAF-COCl) using thionyl chloride following a procedure reported elsewhere.21 Glycerol 1,2-carbonate (25.27 g, 214 mmol) and pyridine (19.0 mL, 235 mmol) were added to dichloromethane (40.0 mL) in a two-necked round bottomed flask equipped with an addition funnel. The mixture was then cooled to −10 °C in an ice-salt bath while being purged under nitrogen atmosphere for at least 20 min. MAF-COCl (33.96 g, 214 mmol) was transferred to the addition funnel under N2 atmosphere and added slowly into the reaction mixture (over the course of 30 min) while maintaining the flask temperature at −10 °C for another 2 h and finally at room temperature for additional 16 h. Following this, the reaction was quenched by adding 8 mL methanol. The reaction mixture was then washed three times with 40 mL of diluted HCl, once with saturated NaHCO3 solution (until neutral pH) and finally with water. The organic layers were collected and dried over MgSO4, filtered and the solvent was removed under vacuum. MAF-cyCB was obtained as a brownish viscous liquid with an overall yield of 55% based on MAF and was characterized by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.

Radical copolymerization of VDF with MAF-cyCB21
The copolymerization of VDF with MAF-cyCB was performed in a 100 mL Hastelloy autoclave Parr system (HC 276) equipped with a Bourdon pressure gauge, a mechanical Hastelloy anchor, a rupture disk (3000 PSI), inlet and outlet valves and a Parr electronic controller (for stirring speed and heating control). A solution of TAPE (0.72 g, 3.12 mmol) and MAF-cyCB (5.00 g, 20.83 mmol) was prepared in DMC (70 mL) and degassed by N2 bubbling for 30 min. Before starting the reaction, the autoclave was pressurized with 30 bar of nitrogen to check for any leaks. It was then placed under vacuum (40 × 10−3 bar) for 30 min to remove any residual traces of oxygen. The solution was transferred into an autoclave under vacuum through a funnel tightly connected to the introduction valve of the autoclave. The reactor was then cooled in a liquid nitrogen bath and VDF gas (12 g, 187.5 mmol) was transferred into it under weight control. Following this, the vessel was stirred mechanically and gradually heated to 74 °C; the evolution of pressure (Pmax = 37 bar) and temperature was recorded. The reaction was stopped after 16 h (the pressure dropped to 22 bar) by placing the autoclave in an ice bath. The unreacted gaseous monomer was purged. Then, the autoclave was opened, and the solvent and unreacted liquid monomer (if there was any) were completely removed under vacuum. The crude product was then dissolved in acetone and precipitated from cold pentane, centrifuged, and then dried under vacuum (20 × 10−3 bar, 50 °C) for 16 h. The yield of the polymerization was determined by gravimetry (mass of the copolymer obtained/mass of monomers introduced in the reactor, yield = 60%). The poly(VDF-co-MAF-cyCB) copolymer, as a brownish soft material, was characterized by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy.

Characterization methods
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
The compositions and microstructures of the copolymer were determined by 1H and 19F NMR spectroscopy, performed on a Bruker AC 400 Spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H and 376 MHz for 19F) using DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 as solvents. Coupling constants and chemical shifts are given in hertz (Hz) and parts per million (ppm), respectively. The experimental conditions for recording the 1H [or 19F] NMR spectra were as follows: flip angle, 90° [or 30°]; acquisition time, 4.5 s [or 0.7 s]; pulse delay, 2 s [or 5 s]; number of scans, 32 [or 64]; and pulse width, 5 μs for 19F NMR.
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
Molecular weight (Mn) and dispersity (Đ) were assessed using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with triple-detection GPC from Agilent Technologies using a PL0390-0605390 LC light scattering detector with two diffusion angles (15° and 90°), a PL0390-06034 capillary viscometer, and a 390-LC PL0390-0601 refractive index detector and two PL1113-6300 ResiPore 300 × 7.5 mm columns. DMF (containing 0.1 wt% of LiCl) was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1 and toluene as the flow-marker. The entire SEC-HPLC system was thermostated at 35 °C. Poly(methyl methacrylate) standards were used for calibrating the SEC instrument and the results were processed using the corresponding Agilent software.
Electrolyte film preparation
Thick electrolyte films were prepared as follows: poly(VDF-co-MAF-cyCB) was dissolved in acetone (30 wt%) with different molar ratios of LiClO4. Acetone was slowly evaporated at 40 °C. The samples were casted on stainless steel electrodes and dried again overnight in vacuo at 40 °C. The thickness was kept constant using a 270 μm thick PTFE spacer between the two stainless steel electrodes in the Swagelok cell.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
DSC measurements were carried out using a Mettler Toledo 822e calorimeter. The samples were analyzed under nitrogen atmosphere in a 40 μL Al pan with an empty Al pan used as the reference cell. In order to erase their thermal history, the samples were initially heated from 25 °C to 200 °C and cooled down from 200 °C to −120 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The temperature was maintained for 2 min before changing the cycle. The samples were then heated from −120 °C to 200 °C at the same heating rate to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg), the melting temperature (Tm), and the melting enthalpy (ΔHm) using Stare software.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
AFM was performed using a multimode scanning probe microscope (Bruker Multimode Nanoscope VIII). AFM imaging was operated in tapping mode using NCL cantilevers (Si, 48 N m−1, 276 kHz, Nanosensors) at a scan rate of 1 Hz. The images were processed by Bruker Nanoscope Analysis software. Silicon wafers were washed with acetone and Milli-Q water before being treated with piranha solution, rinsed in Milli-Q water and dried by spin-coating at 2000 rpm. A copolymer solution at 1 wt% in NMP was spin-coated onto 1 cm2 silicon substrates at a rotation rate of 500 rpm, 1000 rpm and 2000 rpm, respectively.
Rheology
Rheological experiments were performed on a MCR 301 (Anton Paar, Germany) rheometer equipped with a convection oven operating under air. Measurements were conducted using 4 mm stainless steel parallel plate geometry. Oscillatory shear measurements were carried out in the linear regime with a strain amplitude γ of 0.03%. The gap was adjusted between 400 and 550 μm, and the temperature was fixed at 25 °C.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS measurements were performed using a Parstat 4000 apparatus over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 mHz with an amplitude a.c. excitation voltage of 5 mV. The temperature dependence measurements were carried out from 25 °C to 80 °C by gradually increasing the temperature in steps of 10 °C with an equilibration time of 1 h between each step.
Electrochemical stability
The electrochemical stability window was determined on an Arbin Instrument battery tester BT-2043 using the method of linear voltammetry. The polymer electrolyte (≈270 μm) was sandwiched between a stainless steel working electrode and a lithium foil as the counter and reference electrode. The Swagelok cell was assembled in an argon glove box and cycled from 0.5 V to 6 V vs. Li/Li+ at scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1.
Transference number
Transference number measurements were carried out using Li|solid-polymer-electrolyte|Li symmetric cells, thermally equilibrated in an oven at the desired temperature for 24 h before measurement. The d.c. polarization measurements were performed on an Arbin Instrument battery tester BT-2043 with a d.c. bias of 10 mV. The EIS measurements were performed on Parstat 4000 with an a.c. bias of 10 mV.
