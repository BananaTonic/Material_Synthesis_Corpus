4.Conclusion
We fabricated LbL-assembled hybrid Au-CF electrodes with remarkable electrical conductivity (∼6100 S cm−1), high ORR activity, and good operational stability. Additionally, we demonstrated that these Au-CF electrodes could be successfully applied as conductive supports for anodes as well as electrocatalytic cathodes. In particular, an enzymatic anode based on the m-GOx/Au-CF electrode could provide a favorable immobilized enzyme conformation as well as effective electron communication between the immobilized enzyme layer and the highly conducive Au-CF electrode, facilitating charge transfer and enzymatic reaction with decreased internal resistance. These improved performances were mainly induced by the stable formation of electrochemically active Au NP arrays and GOx layers using small NH2-functionalized organic linkers (TRENs). Therefore, under a fixed external resistance, the hybrid BFCs composed of a LbL-assembled 20-GOx/Au-CF anode and 20-Au-CF cathode generated a high-power output with a maximum of 1.2 mW cm−2, which was superior to that of conventional CNT-based BFCs measured under the same conditions (i.e., the use of a fixed external resistor to obtain the power density). Considering that Au-CFs can boost the electrochemical performance of pristine CNTs, we believe that our approach can be effectively applied in various electrochemical applications, including sensors or energy storage devices.
