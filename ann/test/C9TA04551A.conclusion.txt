4.Conclusions
LLOs were successfully modified by both LATP via a citric acid-assisted sol–gel method and CNTs under ultrasonication and stirring. The small LATP particles and CNTs uniformly distribute on the surface of LLOs in the composite materials. The dual coating of LATP and CNTs effectively restrains the structural transition, side reactions with electrolyte and oxygenolysis of electrolyte, so as to alleviate the capacity reduction and voltage drop; simultaneously, the overall conductivity (both ionic conductivity and electronic conductivity) of the composite materials is also enhanced to improve the rate capability of the composite materials. The LLO@LATP@CNT sample shows optimal cycling performance, and the discharge capacity reaches 223.1 mA h g−1 after 2 cycles, and remains at 192.4 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2C. It also displays the lowest voltage decay of merely 0.12 V after 100 cycles. The results of AC impedance and DC polarization kinetic analyses reveal that the LLO@LATP@CNT sample possesses higher electronic conductivity (8.91 × 10−8 S cm−1) and the highest ionic conductivity (1.93 × 10−6 S cm−1), which explains the best rate capability of the sample. In this study, it is tough to conclude which has a more predominant impact among LATP and CNTs; nevertheless, it is confirmed that the two coating materials with different conducting features can jointly improve the electrochemical properties. This new design strategy could also be applied to the surface modification of other electrode materials of lithium-ion batteries to boost the rate capability (the fast charge/discharge capability) and cycling stability of the materials.
