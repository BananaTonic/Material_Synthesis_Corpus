Conclusion
In summary, the influence of the profile of proton-conducting pathway in MOFs was explicitly verified via constructing two types of exclusive hydrogen bond networks in MIL-101 by judiciously selecting the POM modifier. Linear pathways promoted proton diffusion as compared to zigzag pathways. The introduction of flexible polyamine TETA lifted the proton conductivity of HPW-modified MIL-101 to 1.52 × 10−2 S cm−1, approaching the best values of reported MOF proton conductors. These results provide a new viewpoint for the design of MOF-based proton-conducting materials and optimization of proton concentration, mobility, and hopping sites.
