Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated a liquid crystal-assisted fiber spinning of Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets into novel fibers with high volumetric capacitance. We showed that the favorable assembly of MXene and GO nanosheets prevented the GO sheets from re-stacking and improved the circularity and the structural packing within the resulting fiber, which led to high electrical and mechanical properties. These desirable properties and the outstanding electrochemical performance and flexibility suggest that these novel fibers are excellent candidates for further development of textile-based energy storage devices for wearable technologies and miniaturized electronics. Further optimization of fiber spinning conditions can be carried out to achieve fibers with enhanced mechanical, electrical, and electrochemical properties.
