4.Conclusions
We have shown for the first time a facile production of PEDOT:PSS fibers with very high electrical conductivity (up to ∼3828 S cm−1) approaching the highest value reported for 100 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS films. The use of H2SO4 as coagulation bath and modifications of the wet-spinning configuration enabled the simultaneous fast removal of PSS (i.e. within seconds) and alignment of PEDOT chains during fiber formation. The PEDOT:PSS fibers have sufficient high wet-strength to withstand the mechanical mistreatment during fiber production and the dry fibers showed excellent tensile strength of ∼434.8 MPa and a breaking strain of ∼25.4%. As demonstrated by a number of proof-of-concept devices, the pronounced conductivity and mechanical strength bring new opportunities to the PEDOT:PSS fibers, including fast sensing, moisture monitoring, and fiber supercapacitors with longer lengths than previous works. The results presented here provide a new platform towards the understanding and better design of conductive fibers for advanced applications in small flexible and wearable devices. Additionally, efforts are required in developing environmentally friendly methods or use of alternative agents that are as effective as H2SO4 in enhancing the electrical conductivity of PEDOT:PSS fibers.
