Material synthesis
Li6PS5Br solid electrolytes (SEs) were synthesized by a multi-step liquid-phase (LP) technique. Li2S (Mitsuwa Chemical Co., Ltd., 99.9%), P2S5 (Aldrich, 99%), and LiBr (Aldrich, 99.9%) were used as the starting materials. The synthesis of Li6PS5Br was conducted via the following four steps: (1) Li2S and P2S5 with a stoichiometry of 3 to 1 were mixed in super-dehydrated tetrahydrofuran without a stabilizer (THF, Wako). The mixture was stirred overnight. The THF suspension containing the Li3PS4 precursor was thus obtained. (2) Li2S and LiBr (1 : 1 molar ratio) were dissolved in super-dehydrated ethanol (EtOH, Wako, 99.5%). (3) The THF suspension and the EtOH solution were mixed to obtain the pale green THF–EtOH precursor solution of Li6PS5Br. The final molar ratio of Li2S, P2S5, and LiBr was 5 : 1 : 2 in the stoichiometric proportion of Li6PS5Br. The concentration of Li6PS5Br in the THF–EtOH precursor solution was 4.5 wt%. (4) The precursor solution was dried at 150 °C under vacuum for 3 h to generate a solid powder. To enhance its crystallinity, the solid powder was heat-treated at 550 °C under dry Ar. Hereafter, the Li6PS5Br solid samples prepared by the LP technique with heat treatment at x °C are referred to as “LP-x”. For comparison, Li6PS5Br was synthesized by a mechanochemical (MC) technique.29 The MC treatment was carried out using a planetary ball mill (Pulverisette 7, Fritsch) with a zirconia pot (45 mL in volume) and 15 zirconia balls (10 mm in diameter) at ambient temperature. The rotational speed was set at 600 rpm and the milling time was 45 h. The prepared powder was heat-treated at 550 °C under dry Ar to obtain “MC-550”. All the experimental processes were performed in a glove box under dry Ar. In addition, three other synthesis processes were conducted by the LP technique using ethanol and tetrahydrofuran as a single solvent system. The experimental procedures are expounded in the ESI (see Fig. S1). The synthesis conditions are summarized in ESI Table S1.
The Li6PS5Br SE-coated LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) powder was prepared by a solution process. The EtOH precursor solution was mixed with NMC powder. The obtained slurry was dried at 150 °C under vacuum for 3 h to remove EtOH and solidify the electrolyte; thus, NMC particles coated with the Li6PS5Br SE were prepared. The NMC/SE weight ratios were x : 100 − x (x = 85, 90, and 95). In addition, composite electrodes were prepared by mixing NMC with LP-150 or LP-550 using a mortar. Moreover, an infiltrated NMC electrode was prepared based on a previous report.32 Initially, the preparation of the NMC porous electrode was conducted by casting and spreading a slurry of NMC, acetylene black (AB, Denki kagaku kogyo), and polyvinylidene difluoride binder (PVDF, KF1100, Kureha Inc.) with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Wako) solvent on an Al current collector, followed by drying at 120 °C on a hot plate. The SE was infiltrated into the NMC porous electrode by dipping the electrode into the THF–EtOH precursor solution. The obtained composite electrode was dried at 150 °C under vacuum to prepare the infiltrated NMC electrode. The weight ratio of NMC, Li6PS5Br SE, AB, and PVDF was 82.2 : 15.3 : 1.7 : 0.8. The NMC powder was pre-coated with LiNbO3 to prevent undesirable side reactions.33
Material characterization
Crystallographic phase identification was performed using an X-ray diffractometer (SmartLab, Rigaku) with Cu-Kα radiation. Diffraction data were collected in steps of 0.02° over the 2θ range of 5–80° at a scan rate of 4° min−1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted using an airtight container with a beryllium window to prevent exposure of the sample to air. The computer program RIETAN-FP34 was used for the Rietveld analysis. To identify the structural units, Raman spectroscopic analysis was carried out with a Raman spectrophotometer (LabRAM HR-800, HORIBA Ltd.) equipped with a 532 nm He–Ne laser. Scanning electron microscopy characterization was carried out using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SU8220, Hitachi High-Technologies) with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system (EDX, EMAXEvolution X-MAX, Horiba Ltd.). A cross-section of the working electrolyte layer was prepared using an ion milling system with an Ar-ion beam (IM4000, Hitachi High-Technologies). Ion milling to obtain a smooth cross-section was conducted for the sample transferred to an Ar-filled vessel to prevent exposure of the samples to air.
Electrochemical characterization
The ionic conductivity of the SE was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The data were collected in the range of 1 MHz to 10 Hz using an impedance analyzer (1260, Solartron), with an applied AC voltage of 10–25 mV. To determine the ionic conductivities of the SEs, three pellet types were prepared: (1) green compacts pressed at 360 MPa at room temperature, (2) green compacts pressed at 720 MPa at room temperature, and (3) sintered bodies obtained by heat treatment at 550 °C under dry Ar. Au current collectors were used to cover the entire surface of both sides of the pellet. The pellet was sealed in a laminate-type pouch cell to prevent exposure of the sample to air. It was difficult to accurately measure resistances of 100 Ω or less because of the influence of inductance due to the equipment setup, causing the estimated resistance and activation energy of the SEs to be lower than the actual value. Thus, the temperature-dependence of the conductivity was measured from the low temperature region of about −30 °C. The temperature was controlled with an ethanol-cooled bath and a constant temperature bath. The cell was held at the specified temperature for two hours to allow the system to reach thermal equilibrium. The lithium-ion migration activation energy was calculated from the slope of the Arrhenius plot. The electronic conductivity was measured via the DC polarization technique. The data were collected using a potentio-galvanostat (S-1287, Solartron) with applied DC voltages of 0.4, 0.5, and 1.5 V at 25 °C.
All-solid-state cells (Li–In/75Li2S·25P2S5 (mol%) glass/NMC) were fabricated with the following three kinds of working electrodes, where NMC loading masses are described in parentheses: (1) SE-coated NMC powder (17.7 mg cm−2), (2) the infiltrated NMC electrode obtained by the LP techniques (17.9 mg cm−2), and (3) a mixture of LP-150 or LP-550 and NMC powder (14.7 mg cm−2). 75Li2S·25P2S5 (mol%) glass prepared by the MC technique was utilized as the separator. A bilayer pellet consisting of the working electrode and the separator was compressed under 360 MPa of pressure. Indium foil (Furuuchi Chem., 99.999%) and lithium foil (Furuuchi Chem., 99.9%), as counter electrodes, were attached to the other side of the SE separator. All the processes for preparing the cells were performed under dry Ar. Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements for the all-solid-state cells were conducted using a charge–discharge measuring device (BTS-2004, Nagao Co., Ltd.) at 25 °C under dry Ar. The electrochemical tests were performed at constant current densities of 0.13, 0.26, 0.52, 1.3, 2.6, and 5.2 mA cm−2 in the voltage range of 1.9–3.8 V vs. Li–In. The same current densities were applied for the charge and discharge measurements.
