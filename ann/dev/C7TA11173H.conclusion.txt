Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared a novel kind of intrinsically stretchable ACM/MWCNTs@conductive polymer film electrode with low cost, high stretchability and outstanding electrochemical performance. The as-prepared ACM/MWCNT film containing 35 wt% MWCNTs exhibits high electronic conductivity, superior mechanical performance and good plastic deformation after 500 stretching cycles at 50% strain. Because of the characteristic of absorbing organic solution of the ACM matrix, the monomers can easily penetrate into ACM/MWCNT films for electrodepositing conductive polymers (PDAA and PANI), achieving high volumetric specific capacitances of 20.2 and 17.2 F cm−3 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, respectively. An ACM/MWCNTs@PANI//ACM/Et4NBF4–AN//ACM/MWCNTs@PDAA oASSC with high performance was also demonstrated. The as-assembled oASSC shows not only an outstanding energy density of 2.14 mW h cm−3 and a remarkable capacitance retention of 86% at 30 mA cm−2, but also good cycling stability under static and 50% strain conditions. These findings hold great promise for application in stretchable electronics in the future.
