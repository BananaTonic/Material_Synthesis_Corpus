Conclusions
The surface chemistry and small dimensions of CNF used in this work have a profound influence in their performance as proton conducting membranes. The membranes presented in this work show proton conductivity values 10–50× lower than Nafion. However, the membranes outperform Nafion in terms of gas barrier properties and much lower sensitivity to changes in RH. Indeed, the number of water molecules per proton conductive site is more than 100 times higher than that for Nafion 212. Our results suggest that the bound water CNF has a key role in ensuring the proton conduction independently to the amount of bulk absorbed water and gives a dominant contribution specially at low RH. Further, thanks to the superior mechanical properties of CNF membranes compared to Nafion, they can be fabricated to be thinner, potentially reducing the internal cell resistance, without compromising the gas barrier properties. Lastly, our study shows that CNF membranes with their environmental compatibility, renewable origin, low gas crossover and promising fuel cell performance should be considered for use in a new generation of PEMFCs.
