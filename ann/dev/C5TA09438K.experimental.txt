2.2.Synthesis
1-Amino-2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammoniumpropane chloride (pSQA) and N,N-di-(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammoniumpropane chloride)amine (pDQA)
GTMAC (4 g) was dissolved in water (20 mL) to form a solution, and later added into an ammonia solution (13.2 mL) at room temperature. Then the reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h at 40 °C. After the reaction, the solvent and excess ammonia were removed on a rotary vacuum evaporator at 50 °C to yield the mixture of pSQA and pDQA.
pSQA ([NH2CH2CH(OH)CH2N(CH3)3]+Cl−) and pDQA (([CH2CH(OH)CH2N(CH3)3]+Cl−)2NH)
1H NMR (300 MHz, d6-DMSO): NH2– in pSQA: δ 5.6–5.7 ppm, 2H; –CH(OH)– in pSQA and pDQA: δ 4.0–4.3 ppm, 2H; –CH(OH)– in pSQA and pDQA: δ 3.5–3.6 ppm, 3H; –CH2N+(CH3)3 in pSQA and pDQA: δ 3.4–3.5 ppm, 3H, and δ 3.2–3.3 ppm, 3H; –N+(CH3)3 in pSQA and pDQA: δ 3.26 ppm, 26H; –NH2CH2– in pSQA and –NH(CH2)2– in pDQA: δ 2.5–2.8 ppm, 6H; –NH– in pDQA: δ 1.94 ppm, 1H. The mole ratio of pSQA to pDQA was calculated to be 1 : 1.
Elemental analysis
The weight percentages of the elements C, H, and N were tested to be 43.99%, 9.86%, and 14.2%, thus the molar ratio of pSQA to pDQA was calculated to be close to 1 : 1.
Chloromethylation of polysulfone
Chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSF) used in this study was synthesized following a procedure reported previously.22 The chloromethylation process of PSF was carried out in a three-neck round-bottom flask with a mechanical stirrer. PSF (10 g) was dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane (70 mL). After adding zinc powder (1 g) and trifluoroacetic acid (4 mL) into the solution, chloromethylmethylether (20 mL) was added dropwise. The solution was stirred for 3, 5, and 12 h at 30 °C to produce the CMPSF samples with a degree of functionalization (DF) of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, respectively. The DF is the number of chloromethyl groups per repeat unit of the polymer. The thus-obtained CMPSF samples were precipitated in methanol, washed several times with deionized water, and then dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 °C. Since the chloromethylmethylether is a highly efficient reagent for the synthesis of CMPSF, we decided to use it in the chloromethylation reaction, although some other methods are more environmentally friendly for this purpose.32
Quaternary ammonium polysulfone (QAPSF)
CMPSF (DF = 0.5) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a 15 wt% solution, into which trimethylamine was added dropwise, followed by stirring at 40 °C for 1 h.
Synthesis of aQAPSF
CMPSF (DF = 1.0 or 1.5) was dissolved in DMF to form a 15 wt% solution, into which n-hexylamine (50 or 75 mol% of the repeat unit of PSF) was added dropwise, followed by stirring at 40 °C for 2.5 h. Afterwards, trimethylamine (100 mol% of the repeat unit of PSF) was added, followed by stirring at 40 °C for 1 h to prepare the aQAPSF solution.
Pendant-cation quaternary ammonium polysulfone (pQAPSF)
CMPSF (DF = 0.5 or 1.0) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a 10 wt% solution, into which the mixture of pSQA and pDQA (the reactive amine group was 150 mol% of the repeat unit of PSF) was added and stirred for 4 h at 50 °C to produce pQAPSF solution.
Membrane casting
The resulting APE solution was cast onto a clean, flat glass plate and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 20 h and then further dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 10 h.
Anion exchange of APE membranes
To replace the Cl− anion in APE for OH−, the APE membrane was immersed in 1 mol L−1 KOH solution for 10 h. This process was repeated four times to ensure complete displacement. Finally, the APE membrane in the OH− counterion form was repeatedly rinsed with deionized water until the pH of the residual water was neutral.
2.3.Measurements
1H NMR
1H NMR (300 MHz) analysis was performed on a Varian Mercury VX-300 spectrometer using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide ([D6]DMSO) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference.
Elemental analysis
A VarioEL III (Elementar, Germany) was used for analyzing the C, H, and N elemental content in the samples.
Ion exchange capacity (IEC)
The IEC of the APE samples was determined by titration. A membrane (in the OH− form) was immersed in a standard hydrochloric acid solution (0.1 mol L−1, 30 mL) for 48 h. The solution was then titrated with a standard solution of potassium hydroxide (0.1 mol L−1) to pH = 7. The membrane was washed and immersed in deionized water for 24 h to remove any residual HCl, and then dried under vacuum at 45 °C for 24 h and weighed to determine the dry mass (in the Cl− form). The IEC of the membrane was calculated with eqn (1):1where ni(H+) is the initial moles of protons in the HCl solution, nf(H+) is the final moles of protons in the HCl solution determined by titration, and mdry(Cl) is the mass of the dry membrane in the Cl− form.
Ionic conductivity
To measure the ionic conductivity of APEs, a fully hydrated membrane in the OH− form was assembled into a fuel cell test fixture with carbon electrodes. Fully humidified N2 was fed during measurements to exclude the influence of CO2. The OH− conductivity of the fully hydrated membrane with different IEC values was measured by two-probe electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using an AC impedance analyzer (IviumStat, Netherlands) with the frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 1 MHz and an oscillating amplitude of 10 mV. The ionic conductivity was calculated as:2where l is the membrane thickness in cm, A is the electrode area in cm2, and Rmem is the high-frequency resistance in Ω.
Swelling degree and water uptake
In order to obtain the swelling degree (denoted as SD) and water uptake (denoted as WU), both the mass and the dimensions of the dry membranes (in the Cl− form, denoted as Xhyd(Cl) and mdry(Cl)) were first recorded. The membrane was then immersed in 1 mol L−1 KOH solution for 48 h to convert Cl− into OH−, and washed with deionized water for several times to remove the remaining KOH. The dimension Xhyd(OH) and the wet mass mhyd(OH) of the membranes could be determined after wiping the excess water from the surface. Accordingly, the SD and the WU were calculated respectively by:34
Hydration number measurement
The hydration number (λ) represents the ratio between the amount of water molecules and hydroxide ions in the APE, and is defined as follows:5where WU is the water uptake, IEC is the ion-exchange capacity in mol g−1, and MH2O is the molar mass of water, which is equal to 18.015 g mol−1.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
QAPSF, aQAPSF, and pQAPSF solutions were cast to form thin films on a Cu grid followed by exchanging the anions with I− by immersion of the APE-coated Cu grid in 1 M NaI solution. The samples were then subjected to TEM observations. Images were collected on an ultrahigh-resolution transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2010FEF) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
SAXS curves of unstained dry chloride form membranes were obtained using a Rigaku (formerly Molecular Metrology) instrument equipped with a pinhole camera with an Osmic microfocus Cu Kα source and a parallel beam optic. Typical counting times for integration over a multiwire area detector were 1 h with typical membrane thicknesses on the order of 100 μm. Measurements were taken under vacuum at ambient temperature on dry samples. Scattering intensities were normalized for background scattering and beam transmission.
Mechanical properties
The wet APE membranes were cut into a dumbbell shape (12 mm × 3 mm in the test area) and tensile measurements were performed using an Instron-5866 (Norwood, MA) instrument at a crosshead speed of 5 mm min−1 at room temperature (25 °C).
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
TGA was performed on a TGA Q50 (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE) using samples (5 mg) placed in an Al2O3 crucible. The samples were heated from 30 °C to 650 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1 under flowing nitrogen (40 mL min−1).
Chemical stability test
Membrane stability tests were conducted by immersing a piece of an APE membrane sample (50 ± 5 μm in thickness) in 1 M NaOH solution. The solution was maintained at 80 °C for 30 days with replacement of the 1 M NaOH after every 3 days during the testing period. Periodically during the stability test, the IEC and ionic conductivity of APEs were tested to evaluate the changes of the materials under strong alkaline degradation conditions.
Membrane-electrode assembly and fuel cell test
Pt/C (60%, Johnson Matthey Co.) was mixed with a determined quantity of QAPSF (IEC = 1.02 mmol g−1), aQAPSF (IEC = 0.98 mmol g−1), or pQAPSF (IEC = 2.04 mmol g−1) ionomer solution, and sprayed onto each side of QAPSF (IEC = 1.02 mmol g−1), aQAPSF (IEC = 0.98 mmol g−1), or pQAPSF (IEC = 2.04 mmol g−1) membrane (55 ± 5 μm in thickness), respectively, to produce the catalyst-coated membrane (CCM). The Pt loading of both the anode and the cathode was 0.4 mg cm−2, and the area of the electrodes was 4 cm2. The weight percentage of APE in both the anode and the cathode was calculated to be 20 wt%. The resulting CCMs were pressed between two pieces of carbon cloth (CeTech W1S1005) to form the membrane electrode assembly (MEA).
The H2–O2 fuel cells were tested (850e Multi Range, Scribner Associates Co.) under galvanic mode using fully humidified H2 and O2 gases flowing at 250 mL min−1 and a temperature of 60 °C with 0.1 MPa of back pressure.
