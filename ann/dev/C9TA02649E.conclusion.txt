4.Conclusions
In conclusion, the neutral hydroxide vacancy (V0OH) is most likely to occur in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 when appropriate growth conditions are afforded. At 300 °C, it is noted that FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 is formed if ultra-low oxygen pressure is supplied (at least an oxygen pressure (PO2) of 10−2.4 atm) under hydrogen-poor (H-poor) conditions, which is consistent with the experimental value (&lt;10−2 atm). Moreover, low oxygen pressure and high temperature both contribute to the formation of V0OH in FeF2.2(OH)0.8. With the introduction of V0OH, the band gap of FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 reduces relative to that of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 (0.99 eV vs. 1.47 eV), which contributes to the improvement of electronic conductivity of FeF2.2(OH)0.8. Most importantly, it is proposed that the ion diffusion channel of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 is broadened and the balance between Li/Na ions and surrounding anions also occurs at the saddle point during Li/Na intercalation/deintercalation in FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, which allows FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 to possess higher ionic conductivity than FeF2.2(OH)0.8 (6.88 × 10−2 S cm−1vs. 2.03 × 10−2 S cm−1 for Na; 5.16 × 10−4 S cm−1vs. 1 × 10−6 S cm−1 for Li). As a result, FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 can provide a more stable voltage profile than FeF2.2(OH)0.8 in Li/Na batteries. As discussed above, it is concluded that introducing V0OH is an effective strategy to design FeF2.2(OH)0.8-based cathode materials for ultra-high rate and long-life Li/Na-ion batteries.
