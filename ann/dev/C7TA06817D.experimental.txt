2.Experimental methods
2.1.Synthesis
Powders with nominal compositions of GdBa1−xSrxCo2O6−δ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5) were synthesised using the solid state reaction of Gd2O3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%), BaCO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.8%), SrCO3 (Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) and Co3O4 (Alfa Aesar, 99.7%). Stoichiometric amounts of starting powders were manually ground in an agate mortar, sintered at 1100 °C for 60 h in static air in alumina crucibles with intermediate grinding without any pre-calcination step.
2.2.Characterisation methods
The oxygen content calculated from the oxidation state of cobalt was determined using iodometric titration. ∼70 mg of sample was dissolved in 20 ml hydrochloric acid (12 M) by stirring in an argon gas flushed flask, covered by 0.1 M KI. 0.01 M Na2S2O3 solution was used to titrate the iodine generated with starch used as an indicator.
Laboratory powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected at room temperature from 10–120° 2θ using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD utilising CuKα source radiation (λaverage = 1.54 Å) with a step size of 0.016° and accumulating for 0.8 s per step. The crystal structures of GdBa1−xSrxCo2O6−δ were refined by Rietveld analysis31,32 using a fundamental parameter peak shape profile33 implemented in TOPAS Version 4.1.34 The starting models used the P4/mmm,19Pmmm (Z = 1)19 and Pmmm (Z = 2)35 atomic positions of GdBaCo2O6−δ with Sr occupying the same site as Ba. For each data set, a five-coefficient Chebyshev polynomial and 1/x background, a zero error, unit–cell parameters, scale factors and crystal size were refined sequentially. X-ray form factors for Gd3+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Co3+ and O2− were used.
Samples for low energy ion scattering (LEIS), collected using Qtac100 spectrometer, IonTOF GmbH, Germany, were uniaxially pressed, and followed by sintering at 1100 °C for 12 h. The achieved density was 85–95% of theoretical density, measured by the Archimedes method. The pellets were polished to a final particle size of 1/4 μm and subjected to subsequent heat treatment annealing at 600 °C and 800 °C for 12 h in static air. The sample labelling is listed in Table 1. The primary beam used was 5 keV Ne+ normal to the surface with the collection angle of 145° with an analysis area of 500 μm × 500 μm whilst the sputter beam of 0.5 keV Ar+ ions at 59° incidence angle was utilised with a sputter area of 1000 μm × 1000 μm. The larger sputter area ensures that the analysis area is within the sputtered area. The spectra were fitted using SurfaceLab 6 software (IonTOF GmbH, Germany) with Gaussian peaks of different elemental components with the in-depth signal described by error functions.36,37 The estimated depth was calibrated using interferometric (Zygo NewView 200 interferometer) measurement and the assumption of a constant sputter rate throughout the analysis was made.

The surface was carbon coated to minimise the effect of charging. The accelerating voltage and current used were 15 kV and 20 nA, respectively. Standards of gadolinium metal (Gd), BaSO4 (Ba), SrSO4 (Sr) and cobalt metal (Co), obtained from Astimex, were employed. The peak, low background and high background counting time were 20 s, 10 s and 10 s, respectively.
The pellets were fractured in a glove bag under N2 atmosphere to minimise exposure to air and moisture. The exposed fresh pellet surface was characterised using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The spectra were recorded on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha+ X-ray photoelectron spectrometer system operating at 2 × 10−9 mbar base pressure. This system incorporates a monochromated, microfocused Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) and a 180° double focusing hemispherical analyser with a 2D detector. The X-ray source was operated at 6 mA emission current and 12 kV anode bias and a flood gun was used to minimise sample charging. Data were collected at 20 eV pass energy for core level spectra (Ba 4d, Ba 3d, Gd 4d, Sr 3d, Co 2p, O 1s and C 1s), and at 15 eV pass energy for valence band spectra using an X-ray spot size of 400 μm2. All data were analysed using the Thermo Scientific Avantage software package.
2.3.Electrochemistry measurement
The total direct current (DC) conductivity was measured by a standard four-point probe method using a Solartron Modulab on a uniaxially pressed rectangular block (33 mm × 4 mm × 4 mm) sintered at 1100 °C (∼85 to 95% theoretical density). Silver paint was used as a contact with Ag wires. The measurement was conducted under ambient conditions and a DC current of 200 mA was applied.
Double perovskite catalyst inks were prepared by mixing 2 mg of the as-synthesised catalyst, 0.1 ml propan-2-ol (Fisher, Analytical Reagent), 0.4 ml deionised H2O (Barnstead, ≥ 18.2 MΩ cm) and 60 μL of Nafion 117 solution (Sigma Aldrich). The suspensions were sonicated at 20 °C for 30 minutes to ensure homogeneous mixing. 5 μL of the catalyst ink was then drop-cast onto polished glassy carbon electrodes (3 mm diameter, CH Instruments). 17.9 μg of catalyst was typically loaded onto each electrode. The electrochemical measurements were performed in a glass H-cell separated with a porous glass plug in the 3-electrode configuration without rotation. A Hg/HgO (in 0.1 M KOH) electrode (CH Instruments) and a platinum wire were used respectively as reference and counter electrodes. The electrolyte was a 0.1 M KOH solution (Alfa Aesar, 99.98%). The reference was calibrated against RHE (Hydroflex, Gaskatel GmbH) in the same electrolyte. A Gamry Reference 600 potentiostat was used to control and measure potentials/currents. A real-time current interrupt iR drop compensation was applied to the measurements. All current densities were normalised to the geometric surface area of the working electrode.
