4.Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated platinum decorated carbon nanoparticle embedded PANI:CSA (Pt_C/PANI:CSA) paste using chemical reduction and interfacial polymerization. The resulting Pt_C/PANI:CSA exhibits a higher electrical conductivity (792 S cm−1) than other intermediated materials (121 S cm−1 for Pt_C; 580 S cm−1 for PANI:CSA; 656 S cm−1 for C/PANI:CSA) owing to pi–pi overlapping of the carbon/PANI and Pt nanoparticles in the structure. The Pt_C/PANI:CSA hybrid paste was applied as electrode materials in the dipole tag-antenna due to its high electrical conductivity and structural flexibility. The hybrid paste film-based dipole tag-antenna is implemented at a center frequency of 2.88 GHz with a bandwidth of 0.55 GHz and boasted a high transmitted power efficiency of 99.6%. The results reported here indicate that the Pt_C/PANI:CSA-based flexible electrode would be suitable for use as a signal-receiving apparatus such as a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag-antenna.
