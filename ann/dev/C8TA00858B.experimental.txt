Experimental section
Materials and instrumentation
All the materials for syntheses were obtained commercially and used without further purification. All the solvents used were of analytical grade. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX spectrometer operating at 400 MHz in DMSO-d6. Elemental analyses (EA) were conducted using a Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku B/Max-RB diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded on a Nexus 870 FTIR spectrometer in the 400–4000 cm−1 region with KBr pellets. Thermogravimetry analyses (TGA) were performed on a TA Q50 system under a N2 atmosphere (flow rate = 60 mL min−1) in the temperature range 30–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Gas sorption isotherms were measured by using a BEL-max physisorption analyzer after the elimination of guest molecules by evacuation at 80 °C for 24 h. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images were acquired using a Zeiss Sigma 500 emission scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 2–10 kV for SEM images and 20 kV for EDS mapping images.
Synthesis of Na2H2L
The ligand Na2H2L was synthesized according to the route showed in Scheme 1. The precursor L′ of 1,2-bis(4-carboxyphenoxy)ethane was synthesized according to the previous literature.68 1.5 g of L′ (5 mmol) was added to 60 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid in a 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. The final brown homogeneous solution was slowly poured into saturated NaCl aqueous solution. The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with saturated NaCl aqueous solution. After drying at 60 °C under vacuum overnight, Na2H2L was obtained as a white powder. Yield: 1.48 g, 69%. IR (KBr, cm−1): 3400–2500 (s, br), 1691 (s), 1595 (s), 1486 (s), 1421 (s), 1304 (m), 1259 (m, br), 1168 (m), 1086(s), 1037 (s), 1031(m), 915 (m), 872 (s), 824(s), 767 (m), 620 (m), 525 (m) cm−1. 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, TMS) δ: 4.50 (s, 4H), 7.26–7.29 (d, 2H), 7.90–7.93 (d, d, 2H), 8.30–8.31 (d, 2H), 12.60 (s, br, 2H) ppm. 13C NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 166.36, 156.93, 137.50, 132.31, 129.75, 125.45, 120.46, 66.8 ppm. EA calcd for C16H12O12S2Na2: C, 37.94; S, 12.65; H, 2.39%; found: C, 37.97; S, 12.68; H, 2.41%.
Synthesis of the ligand Na2H2L.
Synthesis of MOP-1
Na2H2L (21.5 mg, 0.042 mmol) and bis(cyclopentadienyl)-zirconium dichloride (29.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 1.5 mL mixed solution of N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF) and methanol (v/v = 2/1) followed by the addition of 6 drops of H2O. After ultrasonic processing for 10 minutes, the mixture was transferred into a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 65 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature slowly, colorless block crystals were obtained and washed with DMF (3 × 5 mL). Subsequently, this material was exchanged with CH2Cl2 for 3 days (3 × 5 mL), dried and activated under vacuum at 60 °C (yield 45% based on Zr). IR (KBr pellet, cm−1): 3400–2500(s, br), 1660 (s), 1592 (s), 1526 (s), 1420 (s), 1392(s), 1270(s), 1168 (m), 1088(s), 1022 (s), 934 (s), 818(s), 787 (m), 632 (m), 525 (m) cm−1. EA (activated sample) calcd for [Cp3Zr3(μ3-O)(μ2-OH)3]2L3·4Na·2H2O: C, 35.90; H, 2.86; S, 7.36%; found: C, 35.83; H, 2.98; S, 7.33%.
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis
Single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Rigaku XtaLAB Pro diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å) for MOP-1 at 150 K. The structures were solved by the direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using the SHELXTL-2014 program package. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Due to the presence of highly disordered solvents, refinements were carried out with constraints on a few bond distances, fixed using the DFIX command, and final refinements were performed with the modification of structural factors for the electron densities of the solvent molecules using the SQUEEZE option of PLATON. Crystallographic data and refinement parameters are provided in Table S1, and the selected bond parameters are listed in Table S2.
Measurements of proton conductivity
Proton conductivity of MOP-1 was measured using the AC impedance spectroscopy method. The resistance was measured by using an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (solartron SI 1260) with an oscillating voltage of 100 mV over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 1000 kHz. The sample was ground and pressed into a piece under 3 MPa. The thicknesses of the pellets were in the range of 0.8–1.3 mm, measured by using vernier calipers. Different RHs (22–98%) and testing temperatures (303–333 K) were selected correspondingly. The sample was fully hydrated in a selected relative humidity environment for 48 h prior to testing.
