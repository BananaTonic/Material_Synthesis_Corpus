2.Experimental section
2.1Materials
Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, Mw 9000), FeCl3 (97%), aniline (99%), ammonium persulfate (APS, 98.0%), and camphorsulfonic acid (CSA, 98%) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and used without further purification. Platinum(iv) chloride (99%) was obtained from Kojima Chemicals Co. Pyrrole (98%) and pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid were purchased from Aldrich and Acros Organics. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 35%), chloroform (CHCl3), and ammonia solution (NH3) were acquired from Samchun Co. m-Cresol was obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry. Distilled water was used as the solvent for the polymerization of pyrrole and aniline.
2.2Fabrication of Pt_C nanoparticles
Uniform CPPy nanoparticles of 60 nm diameter were prepared with PVA, FeCl3, and a mixture of pyrrole and pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid monomers in our previous work.37,38 The prepared CPPy nanoparticles were dispersed in an aqueous solution at 0.25 wt% and then 10 mmol PtCl4 aqueous solution was added. The mixed solution was introduced to 1 mmol of NaBH4 as a reducing agent and then ultrasonicated for 2 h at 25 °C. This solution was washed several times and then dried for 12 h at 25 °C to form Pt_CPPy powder. The Pt_CPPy powder was carbonized at 600 °C in an Ar environment to transform CPPy to carbon, resulting in Pt_C nanoparticles.
2.3Fabrication of Pt_C/PANI:CSA hybrid paste
The as-prepared Pt_C powder was added to 2.5 M of HCl aqueous solution with 24 h sonication. Then, the aniline monomer was added under vigorous stirring. After that, 60 ml of chloroform was added to the mixed solution to induce phase separation of the two solvents (bottom: chloroform; top: aqueous). 3.75 M of APS in HCl solution, as an initiator, was added to the above bi-phase solution and stirred for 24 h at −40 °C for interfacial polymerization. After the polymerization process, the solution was centrifuged and dried to obtain a primary doped PANI composite (Pt_C/d-PANI). The Pt_C/d-PANI powder was dispersed in 1.2 M of ammonia solution and vigorously stirred for 24 h to de-dope the PANI chains on the Pt_C, resulting in Pt_C/de-PANI. Then, this solution was centrifuged and dried to collect powder. The Pt_C/de-PANI powder was mixed with the CSA solutions composed of the m-cresol/chloroform co-solvent (volume ratio of m-cresol : chloroform = 7 : 3) to be 2 wt% Pt_C/de-PANI contained solution and stirred for 3 h and sonicated for 24 h to form Pt_C/PANI:CSA paste.
2.4Characterization
TEM and HR-TEM images were obtained with JEOL JEM-200CX and JEOL JEM-3010 microscopes, respectively. A JEOL 6700 instrument was used to obtain FE-SEM images. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using an M18XHF SRA (MAC Science Co.) and an AXIS-His (KRATOS). Optical micrographs were acquired with a Leica DM2500P system. Electrical resistance was obtained using a Keithley 2400 source-meter at 25 °C using a four-point probe method. An E5071B ENA RF Network Analyzer from Agilent Technologies was used to characterize the RFID antennas between 300 kHz and 8.5 GHz. Impedance was plotted on a Smith chart by first normalizing to the characteristic impedance of the system (50 ohm).
