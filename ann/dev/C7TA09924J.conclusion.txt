Conclusions
Guided by general rules for metal-oxide bond stability, we have designed, synthesized, and evaluated a Hf-substituted NaSICON variant with increased alkaline stability, relative to its zirconium-based analogue. Relative to the traditional NZP phase, in “accelerated” high temperature (80°C) exposure experiments, NHP powders showed dramatically increased stability against LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and CsOH, particularly at concentrations of 1 M or less. Greatest instability of the NHP coating occurred in NaOH, suggesting that ion-interactions with mobile Na+ ions in the ceramic may contribute to the increased solubility. The promise of this material was then explored as a newly developed thin film coating, demonstrated by sol–gel growth at reduced temperatures of 775°C on Pt/Si substrates and NZSP ceramic pellets. Integration of NHP thin films onto NZSP pellets was found to only nominally decrease the system Na+ conductance, while extending the time to failure in 10 M KOH at 80 °C from 4.26 to 36.0 h. Ultimately, failure of NHP-coated NZSP pellets is attributed to pinhole defects in the protective NHP films. This integration of compositionally distinct Na+ conductors across disparate length scales (nm, mm) and processing techniques (sol–gel, traditional powder) represents a promising new avenue by which Na+ conducting systems may be developed for previously inaccessible applications.
