Conclusion
In this work, quaternized cellulose cross-linked polysulfone was reported for the first time as an anion exchange membrane for fuel cell applications. The presence of cellulose nanofibers with large surface area and functionality induced high hydroxide conductivity of the resulting membranes. The strategy employed here increases the ionic content with nano-phase separation generating nano-ionic channels. As a result high hydroxide conductivity (74.23 mS cmâˆ’1) is achieved for 15 wt% QC loading, which is 2.7 times higher than that of QPSf/DBB i.e. without quaternized cellulose. The composite membranes showed good dimensional and alkaline stability, good mechanical properties and low methanol permeability benefiting from the cross-linking reaction. This work can be further expanded using different polymeric matrixes and introducing other nano or microfillers to enhance the stability and ionic conductivity.
