4.Conclusions
In this work, we successfully synthesized porous Mg–Ti co-doped LiFePO4 microspheres through the feasible carbothermic reduction reaction combined with the spray drying process. Compared to the undoped sample, the electrical conductivity and diffusion coefficient of the porous Mg–Ti co-doped LiFePO4 microspheres show significant improvement. Through XRD combined with XPS Ar+-sputtering technology, it confirms that Mg and Ti are in the form of doping rather than surface recombination inside LiFePO4 microspheres, and the existence of Fe3+ inside the samples is confirmed as residual FePO4. Especially, the discharge capacities of Mg–Ti co-doped LiFe0.985Mg0.005Ti0.01PO4 microspheres can reach 161.5, 160.3, 156.7, 147.5, 139.8 and 131.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 3C, 5C and 8C, respectively. Moreover, the discharge capacities of porous Mg–Ti co-doped microspheres can remain at 157.3, 151.5 and 127.7 mA h g−1 over 100 cycles at a rate of 0.5C, 1C and 5C, respectively, with the capacity retention of 99.6%, 97.4% and 92.9%. Therefore, Mg–Ti co-doping is an effective way to improve the rate capability and high-rate cycling stability of LiFePO4 batteries for application in electric vehicles and other mobile devices.
