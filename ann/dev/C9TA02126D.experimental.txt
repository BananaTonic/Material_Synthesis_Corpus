Experimental
Reagent-grade Li2S (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich), P2S5 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), and LiBr (99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) crystalline powders were used as starting materials. The required amount of each starting material was sealed in a tungsten carbide (WC)-coated stainless-steel jar with 10 WC balls (8 g per ball) in an argon filled glovebox (H2O, O2 &lt; 0.3 ppm) to minimize the reactivity of the sample with oxygen and moisture. The total weight of the starting mixture was approximately 3.0 g. The mixture was first ball milled with a speed of 110 rpm for 1 h to ensure the homogeneity of the obtained raw mixture, after which it was sealed in a quartz tube and annealed at various temperatures (250, 300, 350, 400, 500, 550, and 600 °C) for 10 hours to obtain different annealed samples. The solid electrolytes (Li6PS5Br) used for the all-solid-state batteries in this work were annealed at 550 °C for 10 h. To prepare the LiBr excess Li6PS5Br, 10% and 15% weight excess of LiBr based on the required amount of LiBr was mixed with the stoichiometric Li2S and P2S5 with rotation speed of 110 rpm for 1 h to obtain a homogenous mixture. Then the mixture was sealed in a quartz tube and annealed at 550 °C for 10 h. These two samples are named 10% excess-Li6PS5Br and 15% excess-Li6PS5Br, respectively.
Powder XRD patterns were collected over a 2θ range of 10–100° to identify the crystalline phases of the different samples using CuKα X-rays (1.5406 Å at 45 kV and 40 mA) on an X'Pert Pro X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical). To prevent reaction with moisture and oxygen, the powders were sealed in an airtight XRD sample holder in an argon filled glove box. Neutron diffraction data was collected on the new neutron powder diffractometer PEARL of the TU Delft. Data was collected at room temperature using the (533) reflection of the germanium monochromator (lambda = 1.665 Å). The sample was loaded under argon in a 6 mm diameter air-tight vanadium sample can. The sample was measured for 18 hours from 10.4–160 degrees 2θ. The data treatment consisted of a detection efficiency correction for each of the 1408 detector pixels and a subtraction of the background, caused by the instrument and the sample can. The neutron and X-ray data were refined simultaneously using the Rietveld method implemented in GSAS.22,23 To investigate the structure evaluation of cathode mixture and the solid electrolyte layer, the assembled solid-state battery was first cycled to different stages and then dissembled. The cathode mixture and the solid electrolyte layer of this solid-state battery were collected and characterized by XRD using a Kapton-sealed sample holder.
The ionic conductivity of the mixture annealed at various temperatures was determined by AC impedance. Stainless-steel disks were attached on both faces of the 10 mm diameter powder pellet. AC impedance measurements were performed using an Autolab (PGSTAT302N) in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz with an applied voltage of 0.01 V.
Laboratory-scale solid-state S–C–Li6PS5Br/Li6PS5Br/Li–In and Li6PS5Br–C/Li6PS5Br/In batteries were prepared. For the S–C–Li6PS5Br/Li6PS5Br/Li–In batteries, the S–C composite mixture was prepared according to our previous work.10 For the Li6PS5Br–C/Li6PS5Br/In batteries, the Li6PS5Br was ball milled with Super P (TIMCAL) and carbon nano-fiber (Sigma-Aldrich) with a weight ratio of 70 : 15 : 15 first with the rotation of 110 rpm for 1 h followed by a higher rotation speed of 500 rpm for 4 h to obtain the final cathode mixture used for the solid-state battery. A two-layer pellet with a diameter of 10 mm, consisting of 5.5–7.0 mg of the described cathode mixture and 135–145 mg of the Li6PS5Br solid electrolyte, was obtained by pressing the electrode and electrolyte powders with 6 tons of pressure. A piece of In foil or Li–In alloy (d = 9.525 mm) were subsequently attached to the other side. Finally, the full solid-state battery pellet was pressed with 2 tons of pressure for 30 s. The assembled cell was charged and discharged with various current densities (0.064, 0.13, and 0.32 mA cm−2) within specified voltage windows (0–3.0 V and 0–5.0 V vs. In) in order to evaluate the electrochemical performance. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the solid-state batteries were performed within the voltage windows of 0–3.0 V and 0–5.0 V vs. In with a sweep speed of 0.2 mV s−1. The obtained capacity in this work was normalized according to the weight of the Li6PS5Br in the cathode. All the cycling measurements for solid-state batteries in this work are performed at room temperature.
