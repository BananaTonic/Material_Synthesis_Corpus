4.Conclusions
With the aim of improving the structural stability and electrochemical properties, Ca-doped Y1−xCaxBaCo2O5+δ double perovskites were synthesized and investigated systematically. The samples with x ≤ 0.2 are single-phased with a tetragonal P4/mmm structure, while in the case of the compound with x = 0.3, a small amount of a second YBa2Co3O9 phase exists. Ca substitution for Y successfully improved the structural stability and durability of Y1−xCaxBaCo2O5+δ at elevated temperatures. The TEC of the samples is slightly reduced from 18.7(5) × 10−6 K−1 for x = 0 to 18.1(1) × 10−6 K−1 for x = 0.2. The studied YCBC materials show good chemical compatibility with the LSGM electrolyte at 1000 °C. Due to the increased concentration of electron holes rather than the formation of oxygen vacancies, the electrical conductivity is also enhanced by Ca-doping. The ASRs of symmetric cells with the LSGM electrolyte and Y1−xCaxBaCo2O5+δ cathodes decrease with increasing Ca content. Y0.8Ca0.2BaCo2O5+δ shows the smallest polarization resistance at 700 °C, which is only 0.068 Ω cm2. The recorded maximum power density reached 1066, 841, 634 and 430 mW cm−2 at 850, 800, 750 and 700 °C, respectively, indicating that Y0.8Ca0.2BaCo2O5+δ double perovskite is a very promising cathode material for IT-SOFCs. The strategy of Ca-doping at the Y-site successfully improved the structural stability, electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance of Y1−xCaxBaCo2O5+δ. Thus, it is expected that by appropriate Ca-doping at the Ln-site in the layered double perovskites it is possible to develop a highly efficient and structurally stable cathode material for IT-SOFCs.
