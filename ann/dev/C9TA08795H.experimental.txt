Super dry acetonitrile (J&amp;K), 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA, J&amp;K), sodium p-styrenesulfonate (J&amp;K), thionyl chloride (TC, Aladdin), and super dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, J&amp;K) were used as-purchased without further purification. LiFePO4 (MTI Kejing Co., Ltd.), Super P (TIMCAL) and PVDF (Arkema) were dried at 50 °C overnight before use. Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercaptopropionate) (PETMP, Aldrich), pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PET4A, J&amp;K), ethylene carbonate (EC, Suzhou Duoduo) and dimethylene carbonate (DMC, Suzhou Duoduo) were dried and stored in a glove box (H2O &lt; 0.1 ppm, O2 &lt; 0.1 ppm). 4-Vinyl-benzenesulfonyl chloride and fluorosulfonamide were synthesized according to the method reported in the literature.
3.2Preparation procedure of the electrospun PVDF membrane and LFPP@PVDF SIPE
3.2.1Preparation of the electrospun PVDF membrane
PVDF solution with a weight concentration of 20 wt% was dissolved in a mixed solvent of DMF and acetone (7 : 3, v/v).35 Electrospinning was performed at a flow rate of 0.05 mL min−1 under a dropout voltage of 20 kV on an electrostatic spinning machine (SS series, Beijing Yongkang). The distance between the needle point and the aluminium drum collector was set as 17 cm. After 6–10 h, the electrospun PVDF membrane was removed from the collector drum and then it was vacuum dried under high vacuum at 50 °C for 12 h. Then the membranes were cut into circular disks (Φ = 16 mm) before use.
3.2.2Synthesis of lithium [(4-styrenesulfonyl)(fluorosulfonyl)imide] (LiSFSI)
Fluorosulfonamide (FSO2NH2)
FSO2NH2 was synthesized through two steps of nucleophilic substitution reactions49 as shown in Scheme 3. Dried SbF3 was added into ClSO2NCO with a mole ratio of 1 : 3. After 12 hours reaction, FSO2NCO could be obtained by atmospheric distillation collecting fractions at 64 °C with a yield of 92%. Freshly distilled FSO2NCO (50.03 g, 0.4 mol) was diluted with dichloromethane (250 mL) at −15 °C, and then H2O (7.21 g, 0.4 mol) diluted with CH3CN (140 mL) was slowly added dropwise. Meanwhile, the reaction occurred with a large amount of CO2. The reaction was continued at room temperature for another 2 h at least until no gas generated. After that, the solvent was removed by atmospheric distillation. Afterwards, the fraction (FSO2NH2) of 72 °C at 5.5 mm Hg was collected by distillation under reduced pressure, appearing a colorless transparent liquid at room temperature with a yield of 24.6 g (62%). EI-MS: m/z = 99 (100%, FSO2NH2), m/z = 80 (66%, –SO2NH2).
Potassium [(4-styrenesulfonyl)(fluorosulfonyl)imide] (KSFSI)50
4-Vinylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (44.59 g, 0.22 mol, PSCl) is reacted with K2HPO4 (77.35 g, 0.44 mol) using 4-tert-butylcatechol (0.33 g, TBC) as the inhibitor and dimethylaminopyridine (0.74 g, DMAP) as the catalyst in dry CH3CN (220 mL) at 0 °C under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. And then freshly distilled fluorosulfonamide (20.00 g, 0.20 mol) was slowly added dropwise in 30 min. After that, the reaction was continued at room temperature for at least 72 h. The solution was added to 1000 mL CH3CN to dissolve precipitated KSFSI before filtration. And then the filtrate was evaporated, and washed with dichloromethane 4 times to remove the excess reactant (PSCl). The obtained potassium [(4-styrenesulfonyl)(fluorosulfonyl)imide] (KSFSI) (28.5 g, yield 47%) appeared as a white and loose power.
1H NMR and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on an NMR spectrometer (Bruker Avance III -500) with CH3CN-d3 as the solvent. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was carried out on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ Quantum Ultra) within the m/z range of 50–1000 Da with CH3CN as the solvent. Elemental analysis was carried out using an Elemental Analyzer (Vario EL) to analyze C, H and N contents.

Lithium [(4-styrenesulfonyl)(fluorosulfonyl)imide] (LiSFSI)
LiSFSI was synthesized between KSFSI and LiClO4 in CH3CN in almost quantitative yield under a N2 atmosphere for 12 hours, which was similar to the preparation of lithium (fluorosulfonyl)(pentafluoroethanesulfonyl)imide.51 After filtration to remove insoluble side products (KClO4, etc.), the solution was evaporated below 40 °C to obtain a crude product of LiSFSI. LiSFSI was separated with anhydrous ether, while impurities like KSFSI, LiClO4 and KClO4 are not soluble in ether. Finally, a white fluffy powder was obtained after removing solvent at room temperature.

3.2.3Preparation of the LFPP@PVDF SIPE
The single ion polymer electrolyte was synthesized by one-step photoinitiated polymerization52 of LiSFSI, PETMP and PET4A with PVDF as the standing membrane, DMPA as the photoinitiator, and a mixed solvent of DMC : EC (v/v = 1 : 1) as the plasticizer, and was abbreviated as LFPP@PVDF SIPE. The preparation process of LFPP@PVDF SIPEs is shown in Scheme 3. Firstly, the precursor was prepared by mixing LiSFSI, PETMP, PET4A and DMPA in DMC and EC (v/v = 1 : 1) solvent according to the proportions in Table 2. The precursor (50 μL) was added into a PVDF electrospun disk (Φ = 16 mm, d = 50 μm), and then the membrane was exposed to UV-light at λ = 365 nm from a Hg UV lamp for 20 min to enable complete polymerization of the monomers. Afterwards, the LFPP@PVDF SIPE could be obtained.

DSC analysis of LFPP-4/2/1 was carried out on a NETZSCH DSC200PC Phox under a nitrogen atmosphere. The LFPP-4/2/1 sample was first heated from 30 to 200 °C, followed by cooling to −100 °C and reheating up to 200 °C.
The morphologies of LFPP-4/2/1@PVDF SIPEs and PVDF were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-6330F) after the membranes were dried under high vacuum at 50 °C for 12 h.
The tensile strength of the SIPEs and electrospun PVDF was measured at a stretching rate of 25 mm min−1 using a universal mechanical testing machine (New SANS, Shenzhen, China).
3.3Ionic conductivity measurement
Ionic conductivity (σ) was calculated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) on an electrochemical workstation (Solartron 1255B) within a frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz with a voltage amplitude of 5 mV.46,53 To measure the ionic conductivity, blocking symmetric stainless steel (SS)/SIPE/stainless steel (SS) cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (H2O &lt; 0.1 ppm, O2 &lt; 0.1 ppm).
3.4Lithium-ion transference number measurement and electrochemical stability window (ESW)
The lithium-ion transference number (tLi+) of the prepared electrolytes was calculated by combining EIS measurements and DC polarization chronoamperometry tests in a “Li/SIPE/Li” symmetric cell. EIS measurement was performed from 100 kHz to 1 Hz at a voltage amplitude of 10 mV before and after the DC polarization chronoamperometry test. The DC polarization chronoamperometry test was carried out under a polarization voltage of 10 mV.
To measure the electrochemical stability window of the LFPP@PVDF SIPE, a standard 2032 coin cell with a SS electrode as the cathode and lithium foil as the anode was assembled to conduct linear scanning voltammetry from 0 to 6.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) with a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 at room temperature.
3.5Galvanostatic Li plating/stripping cycling tests
Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were conducted to estimate the compatibility of the LFPP@PVDF SIPE with the Li metal anode and dendrite-suppressing performance. The cycle performance of symmetric Li/Li cells was tested by being alternatively charged and discharged every 1 h under a constant current density of 1 mA cm−2.
3.6Battery performance
LiFePO4 (80 wt%), Super P (10 wt%) and PVDF (10 wt%) were milled in NMP overnight by ball milling with a rotation speed of 200 rpm to obtain a homogenous slurry, and then it was coated onto a carbon coated Al plate by an automatic coating machine. And then the plate was pre-dried at 50 °C for 2 h and then further dried at 50 °C in a high vacuum oven for another 12 h.54 The dried cathode plates were punched into circular disks (φ = 12 mm) and the loading density of LiFePO4 was about 1.8 mg cm−2. The LFP half cells were assembled with lithium metal as the anode and SIPE as the electrolyte and separator in standard CR2025 coin cells in an argon-filled glove box. As control groups, batteries using a liquid electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in DMC and EC (v/v = 1 : 1) with Celgard 2500 as the separator were assembled in standard CR2025 coin cells. Electrochemical performance tests were performed in a voltage range between 2.5 V and 4.2 V at 28 °C at various current densities. Li/LFP cells with the LFPP-4/2/1@PVDF SIPE and LE@Celgard as the electrolyte and separator after 100 charge–discharge cycle performance were disassembled, and then the anodes were washed with DMC in a glove box for SEM analysis.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of LiFePO4/Li cells with the prepared SIPE or LE@Celgard were carried out from 2.5 V to 4.2 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 at room temperature.
