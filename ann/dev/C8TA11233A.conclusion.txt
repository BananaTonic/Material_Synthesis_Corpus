Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a flexible and freestanding membrane of vanadium pentoxide can be prepared just by re-assembling its exfoliated layers. The atomically thin space between the layers of the vanadium pentoxide membrane was exploited as nanofluidic channels to study ion transport characteristics under extreme confinement. Due to the coordinated hopping of protons between two-dimensionally arranged water molecules, vanadium pentoxide nanofluidic channels exhibit a remarkable proton mobility 5.04 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, the highest among all the layered materials based nanofluidic devices reported so far. Moreover, vanadium pentoxide based nanofluidic devices exhibit a membrane shape dependent ion transport characteristic. While the rectangular pieces of membranes exhibit linear I–V curves, the triangularly cut membranes display a diode-like ionic current rectification behavior in the surface-charge-governed regime. The rectification ratio of the vanadium pentoxide triangle can be easily tuned just by tuning its shape. The triangular ion rectifier of V2O5 also pumps ions against the concentration gradient under the fluctuating external potential with zero mean. Given the unique optical and electronic properties of vanadium oxide, its molecularly thin nanofluidic channels could offer a new platform for discovering exciting nanofluidic and mixed conducting properties. Additionally, systematic studies on the ion transport characteristic through the interlayer spacings of vanadium oxide would help to understand/improve the performance of vanadium oxides in areas like lithium/sodium ion batteries, chemical sensing, and catalysis.
