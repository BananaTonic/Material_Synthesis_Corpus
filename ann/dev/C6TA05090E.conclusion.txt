Conclusions
In summary, poly(ether sulfone)s bearing pendant quaternary ammonium groups via various lengths of flexible spacers were prepared via nucleophilic polycondensation, demethylation and Williamson reactions. All the AEMs exhibit clear micro-phase separation morphology due to the immiscibility between the hydrophilic side chain and the hydrophobic backbone. It is observed that the length of the flexible spacer linking the cationic groups and backbone has a great influence on the performance of AEMs. The optimum conductivity (62.7 mS cm−1, 80 °C) was observed for PES-6-QA with hexyleneoxy spacers, suggesting that too long alkyl groups in the side chain will increase the hydrophobicity of the membrane, which is bad for fabricating highly efficient ion conducting channels due to the reduced water content. The Hofmann degradation of QA groups in the membrane can be inhibited by increasing the length of the flexible spacer (n ≥ 4) between the backbone and QA groups. The PES-12-QA membrane demonstrated the highest stability after immersing in a 1 M aqueous KOH solution at 60 °C for 720 h. The single cell test showed a moderate performance of the PES-6-QA membrane, which holds promise for application in alkaline fuel cells.
