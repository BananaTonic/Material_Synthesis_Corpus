2.Experimental section
In this work, all materials and chemicals were analytical grade and used without further purification. LiFe1−x−yMgxTiyPO4 (x = 0, 0.005; y = 0, 0.01) materials were synthesized through the carbothermic reduction process as described below. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving stoichiometric amounts of FePO4, Li2CO3, C6H12O6, C4H6O4Mg·4H2O and TiO2 (molar ratio of Fe : Li : C : Mg : Ti = 1 : 1.05 : 0.5 : 0.005 : 0.01) in deionized water (the solid content was controlled at 40–50 wt%) and ground using a basket grinder with a rotation speed of 1000 rpm for more than 30 min. By contrast, the undoped LiFePO4 precursor materials were prepared without adding C4H6O4Mg·4H2O and TiO2via the same method. Then this slurry was transferred to a grinder (0.4 mm zirconia microspheres) with a rotation speed of 3500 rpm. After the particle size of the slurry reached approximately 270 nm, spray granules were obtained using a spray dryer at the rate of 15 mL min−1, dried at inlet and outlet temperatures of 200 °C and 100 °C, respectively (the solid content of the slurry was controlled at 20–25 wt%), then calcined at 700 °C for 10 h under a N2 atmosphere. Finally, the obtained undoped and Mg–Ti co-doped LiFePO4 samples were denoted as LFP and MT-LFP, respectively.
Glucose and the raw material for preparing LiFePO4 were measured by TG-DSC (TA, SDT Q600) at a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in a dry nitrogen flow. The crystal structures and morphologies of the obtained LFP samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, D/max-RB) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-IT300). Surface analysis of the obtained LFP samples based on the etching time was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250) by Ar+-sputtering. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (77.3 K) on an automatic surface area &amp; porosity analyzer (Quantachrome, Quadrasorb SI). The conductivity, carbon content and specific surface area of the samples were determined using a digital four-point probe tester (ST2258A), elemental analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Vario EL) and BET surface analyzer (ST-08A), respectively. Mg and Ti contents in the products were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP, VARIAN, Varian 715-ES).
The working electrodes were prepared by dispersing 88 wt% active materials, 5 wt% super P as the conducting agent and 7 wt% poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent as the binder to form a homogeneous slurry, which was uniformly coated onto an aluminum current collector. After drying at 80 °C over 12 h, the cathode was cut into pellets with a diameter of 12 mm and an active mass loading of ∼10 mg. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC)-dimethyl carbonate (DMC)-ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) (1/1/1 in volume). Then the coin-type cells were assembled in a glove box filled with high-purity Ar gas ([O2] &lt; 0.1 ppm, [H2O] &lt; 0.1 ppm). All electrochemical measurements were performed using two-electrode coin half-cells (CR2032) with metallic lithium foil as the counter and reference electrode and a Celgard 2400 microporous membrane as the separator. Galvanostatic discharge–charge tests were performed using a Neware BTS-53 tester with cut-off potential windows of 2.0 V and 3.75 V (vs. Li/Li+) using constant current/constant voltage (CC/CV) mode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV, CHI 660E) measurements were performed at different scan rates between 2.0 V and 4.2 V (vs. Li/Li+). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, CHI 660E) was carried out using a perturbation amplitude of 5 mV at an open-circuit potential with a frequency range from 100 kHz to 10 mHz.
