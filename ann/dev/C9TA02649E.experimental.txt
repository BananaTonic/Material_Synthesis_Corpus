3.Results and discussion
3.1Crystal structure of FeF2.2(OH)0.8
FeF2.2(OH)0.8 has a hexagonal-tungsten–bronze structure with the space group Cmcm, as shown in Fig. 1a. The unit cell contains 26 F, 12 Fe, 10 H and 10 O atoms. And the Fe atoms are located at the center of the octahedron which is composed of F, Fe and O atoms, occupying two kinds of positions (4b and 8d Wyckoff positions). Both the calculated and experimental lattice parameters of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 are listed in Table 2. It is obvious that only slight deviations (less than 1.13%) appear between the calculated and experimental values, indicating that our computational models and details are reasonable.

Chemical potential has a close relationship with the formation enthalpy of vacancy defects in solids. And it is an important parameter for defining the thermodynamic stability diagram. The individual chemical potentials (μi) of isolated atoms are usually lower than the atomic chemical potentials of stable elements in the same substance.57 And it can be expressed as μi = μsolid/gasi + Δμi, where μsolid/gasi means the chemical potential of the standard reference state, which is equivalent to the total energy per atom, and Δμi denotes the relative chemical potential (for details see the ESI).
The thermodynamic equilibrium of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and its competing phases was further analyzed, as shown in Fig. 2. Here, thermodynamically stable phases are clearly present under hydrogen-rich (H-rich) (ΔμH = 0 eV) and hydrogen-poor (H-poor) (ΔμH = −2.43 eV) conditions. Under H-rich conditions (see Fig. 2a), the pentagon enclosed by points A, B, C, D and E represents the stable FeF2.2(OH)0.8. Here, the relative chemical potential (ΔμF, ΔμFe, ΔμO, and ΔμH) at points A–E can be summarized as: point A (ΔμF = −0.61 eV, ΔμFe = −8.27 eV, ΔμO = −2.50 eV, and ΔμH = 0 eV), point B (ΔμF = −2.41 eV, ΔμFe = −2.87 eV, ΔμO = −4.30 eV, and ΔμH = 0 eV), point C (ΔμF = −3.85 eV, ΔμFe = 0 eV, ΔμO = −3.93 eV, and ΔμH = 0 eV), point D (ΔμF = −4.27 eV, ΔμFe = 0 eV, ΔμO = −2.77 eV, and ΔμH = 0 eV), and point E (ΔμF = −4.16 eV, ΔμFe = −0.56 eV, ΔμO = −2.37 eV, and ΔμH = 0 eV). Points A–E correspond to the three-phase coexistence of FeF3, H2O and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, equilibrium state among FeF2, FeF3 and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, two-phase coexistence of FeF2 and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, two-phase coexistence of Fe2O3 and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, and three-phase coexistence of Fe2O3, H2O and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, respectively.
Stability diagram of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 under (a) hydrogen-rich (ΔμH = 0 eV, the red region surrounded by points A, B, C, D and E) and (b) hydrogen-poor (ΔμH = −2.43 eV, the red region surrounded by points F, G, H and I) conditions.
Therefore, FeF2.2(OH)0.8 is likely to form when the relative chemical potential (Δμi) is restrained in the following range: −4.27 eV &lt; ΔμF &lt; −0.61 eV, −8.27 eV &lt; ΔμFe &lt; 0 eV, and −4.30 eV &lt; ΔμO &lt; −2.37 eV. Under H-poor conditions (see Fig. 2b), the quadrilateral FGHI represents the stable region of FeF2.2(OH)0.8. The relative chemical potential (ΔμF, ΔμFe, ΔμO, and ΔμH) at points F–I can be obtained as: point F (ΔμF = −0.54 eV, ΔμFe = −8.48 eV, ΔμO = 0 eV, and ΔμH = −2.43 eV), point G (ΔμF = −2.41 eV, ΔμFe = −2.87 eV, ΔμO = −1.87 eV, and ΔμH = −2.43 eV), point H (ΔμF = −2.97 eV, ΔμFe = −1.75 eV, ΔμO = −1.73 eV, and ΔμH = −2.43 eV) and point I (ΔμF = −2.46 eV, ΔμFe = −4.26 eV, ΔμO = 0 eV, and ΔμH = −2.43 eV). These four points indicate the two-phase coexistence of FeF3 and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, three-phase coexistence of FeF2, FeF3 and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, three-phase coexistence of FeF2, Fe2O3 and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, and two-phase coexistence of Fe2O3 and FeF2.2(OH)0.8, respectively. It is concluded that FeF2.2(OH)0.8 can be synthesized under H-poor conditions as long as the relative chemical potential (Δμi) is restrained in the following range: −2.97 eV &lt; ΔμF &lt; −0.54 eV, −8.48 eV &lt; ΔμFe &lt; −1.75 eV, and −1.87 eV &lt; ΔμO &lt; 0 eV.
3.3Analysis of vacancy formation energy in FeF2.2(OH)0.8
In order to determine the feasibility of the formation of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 with defect structures, the formation energies of five types of neutral vacancy defects, including F vacancy, Fe vacancy, O vacancy, H vacancy and OH vacancy, have been systematically investigated. And they are labeled as V0F, V0Fe, V0O, V0H and V0OH, respectively. The optimal crystal structure of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 with V0OH is presented in Fig. 1b and other optimal defect structures are all presented (for details see Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI). Then, the defect formation energy(ΔHD) can be calculated according to the following expression:8where ED and E0 are the total energies of the defect cell and the perfect cell, respectively. ni denotes the number of atoms of species i, which has been added (ni &gt; 0) or removed (ni &lt; 0) from the ideal supercell. μi is the atomic chemical potential of species i, and it varies according to the relative chemical potential coordinates at points A–I in Fig. 2a. And the defect formation energy as a function of the chemical potential is shown in Fig. 3a. Here, points A–E refer to different growing environments under hydrogen-rich conditions. And points F–I indicate growing environments under hydrogen-poor conditions. Comparing the formation energies at points A–I, it is most feasible to fabricate FeF2.2(OH)0.8 with V0OH (FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08) due to the lowest formation energy at point G.
(a) The formation energy of neutral vacancy defects in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 as a function of the chemical potential at points A–I which are shown in Fig. 2; (b) the vacancy formation energy of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 with charged vacancy defects as a function of the Fermi energy at point G which is shown in Fig. 2b.
Next, let us further discuss the effect of charge defects, including VF+, VFe2−, VFe3−, VH−, VO+ and VO2+, together with V0OH as a reference. In this part, we first explored their optimal growth conditions under hydrogen-poor and hydrogen-rich conditions via formation energy (ΔHD,q) defined as:9where ED,q is the total energy of the defect cell. EV is the maximum value of the valence band (VBM) of the ideal cell, q represents the charge state of vacancy defects and EF denotes the Fermi level which varies from 0 to the band gap of the ideal cell.
After growth condition search, point G is still highly favourable for the formation of V0OH in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 (for details see Fig. S4 and S5 in the ESI). Accordingly, Fig. 3b shows the change rule of formation energy of charge defects as a function of the Fermi level (EF) at point G. Here, the slope of the line corresponds to the charge state. Among various vacancy defects, it is noted that V0OH exhibits the lowest formation energy across all values of the Fermi level, indicating that FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 has the most stable structure. Besides, combining the analysis of the formation energies and relative chemical potential of oxygen (ΔμO), we can find that when the lower value of ΔμO exists, the formation of V0OH in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 will be easier. In other words, an oxygen-deficient environment is also favourable to the formation of FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08. According to the obtained value of ΔμO, the close relationship among ΔμO, oxygen pressure (PO2) and temperature (T) is accordingly presented in Fig. S3. Considering the sample treated at 300 °C, we also calculated the required oxygen pressure at 573.15 K. It is noted that at least an oxygen pressure (PO2) of 10−2.4 atm needs to be provided for successfully fabricating FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 at 300 °C, which is consistent with the experimental ultra-low oxygen pressure conditions (&lt;10−2 atm).40 In a way, it is further confirmed that our calculation method and details both are reasonable. In addition, low oxygen pressure and high temperature both can contribute to the formation of FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, which affords more optional conditions to synthesize FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 in experiment.
3.4The effect of vacancy defects on the crystal structure and electronic structure of FeF2.2(OH)0.8
To obtain the detailed effect of V0OH on the crystal structure of FeF2.2(OH)0.8, we further analyzed the change of the local atomic structure in the vicinity of V0OH before and after V0OH is introduced. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3, we summarized Fe1–O1–Fe2 and Fe2–O3–Fe3 bond angles together with Fe1–O1, Fe2–O1, Fe2–O3 and Fe3–O3 bond lengths (d) in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08. As one OH group breaks away from the crystal lattice, one dangling bond occurs on each neighboring Fe atom, which results in the surrounding Fe atoms being relaxed outward. Consequently, Fe2–O3 and Fe3–O3 bond lengths decrease remarkably due to the increase of coulomb binding between O and Fe atoms. This relaxation induces the Fe2–O3–Fe3 bond angle to increase considerably from 139.75° to 159.91°. Both Fe1–O1 and Fe1–O2 bond lengths also decrease to some degree. On the other hand, the Fe2–O1 bond length increases slightly due to distortion of surrounding O and Fe atoms. Therefore, V0OH induces the redistribution of its surrounding atoms and the obvious structural distortion of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 appears. As a result, the ion diffusion channel can be broadened to some extent (for details see Fig. S6 in the ESI), which contributes to high-efficiency lithium and sodium storage.

For perfect ‘Fe2–O3–Fe3’ (see Fig. 5a left panel), it is clearly illustrated that there is an obvious overlap of Fe2-3d and Fe3-3d orbitals with the O3-2p orbital. Where, the energy levels are located at 2.75 eV, −0.05 eV and −0.50 eV. The effective Bader charges are 1.97 |e| (Fe2), 1.98 |e| (Fe3) and −1.20 |e| (O3), which indicates that a strong covalent interaction occurs between Fe2-3d and O3-2p orbitals, as well as between Fe3-3d and O3-2p orbitals. And the conduction bands are mainly composed of Fe2-3d and Fe3-3d orbitals.

As V0OH is introduced in FeF2.2(OH)0.8, stronger hybridization between Fe-3d and O-2p orbitals occurs. Here, the Fe2-3d orbital hybridizes with the O3-2p orbital at 2.75 eV, −0.05 eV, −0.30 eV, −0.40 eV, −0.70 eV and −1.35 eV, respectively. And the Fe3-3d orbital hybridizes with the O3-2p orbital at 2.75 eV, −0.05 eV, −0.30 eV, −0.40 eV, −0.70 eV and −1.35 eV, respectively. Compared with the system without V0OH, the Fe-3d and O-2p orbitals undergo stronger hybridization. Here, the effective Bader charges of Fe2 and Fe3 decrease to 1.95 |e| and 1.87 |e|, respectively. And the effective Bader charge of O3 changes from −1.20 |e| to −1.05 |e|. That is to say, the Fe–O ionic bond is weakened due to V0OH. Besides, the Fe2-3d and Fe3-3d orbitals both move toward the low-energy region. And they both move from 2.20 eV to 1.80 eV, which results in the decrease of band-gap energy of the ‘Fe2–O3–Fe3’ cluster.
Similarly, by analysis of density of states and Bader charges, it is found that although the Fe–O ionic bond is weakened in the ‘Fe1–O1–Fe2’ cluster to some extent (see Fig. 5b), the Fe1-3d orbital shifts drastically towards the low-energy region (from 2.40 eV to 1.50 eV) relative to Fe2-3d and Fe3-3d orbitals, which induces a rapid band-gap decrease of the ‘Fe1–O1–Fe2' cluster.
To further visualize the effect of V0OH on the bonding nature of the Fe–O bond, we presented the total charge density of ‘Fe2–O3–Fe3’ and ‘Fe1–O1–Fe2’ clusters in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 with and without V0OH, as shown in Fig. 6.

For the ‘Fe2–O3–Fe3’ cluster, as V0OH is introduced, it is observed that the Fe2 and Fe3 atoms are polarized slightly toward the bridging O3 atoms and more obvious directivity is strengthened relative to that in perfect FeF2.2(OH)0.8. Accordingly, more shared electrons gather between Fe and O atoms. And the covalent bond between Fe and O atoms is strengthened by V0OH. Compared with the ‘Fe2–O3–Fe3’ cluster, V0OH has a less effect on the weakening of the Fe–O ionic bond in the ‘Fe1–O1–Fe2’ cluster.
Next, we turn to further analyze the role of ‘Fe2–O3–Fe3’ and ‘Fe1–O1–Fe2’ clusters in the effect of the total electronic structure with the introduction of V0OH into FeF2.2(OH)0.8. First, the partial density of states (PDOS) of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 are presented in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. As for perfect FeF2.2(OH)0.8, it can be observed that the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly contributed by O-2p and Fe-3d orbitals, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is mostly composed of Fe-3d and F-2p orbitals. And the Fe-3d orbitals are mixed with O-2p orbitals near the valence band maximum, indicating strong interaction between Fe-3d and O-2p orbitals. The band gap is 1.47 eV, which is close to the reported value (1.44 eV).58 For FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, the composition of the orbitals is similar to those near the CBM, which is mainly contributed by O-2p orbitals, as depicted in Fig. 7b. The corresponding conduction band moves toward the valence band due to the existence of V0OH, causing its band-gap to decrease to 0.99 eV. Interestingly, the corresponding reduced band-gap is consistent with the reduced value of the ‘Fe1–O1–Fe2’ cluster (0.50 eV). In other words, V0OH triggers the sharp shift of the Fe1-3d orbital to the low-level region, bringing about reconfiguration of the Fe-3d orbitals of neighboring Fe atoms. Therefore, a lower band gap of FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 than that of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 occurs (for details see Fig. S7–S10 in the ESI).

As a whole, V0OH not only can affect the crystal structure of FeF2.2(OH)0.8, but also can influence the configuration of atomic orbitals, inducing the Fe-3d orbitals to shift towards the low-energy region. As a result, the bonding character of the Fe–O bond is changed and the band gap of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 decreases with the introduction of V0OH, which is beneficial for improvement of its electronic conductivity.
3.5Li/Na diffusion kinetics in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08
Strong binding energy, a low diffusion barrier and high ionic mobility are of vital importance for fast charge and discharge of rechargeable batteries.59 Thus, we turn to tackle the mechanism of lithium/sodium storage in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08. First, we investigate Li/Na occupation behavior by analysis of the relationship between binding energy and coordination number. The binding energy (Ebind) can be expressed as Ebind = Etotal − E0 − E1, where Etotal, E0 and E1 are the total energies of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 (FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08) with Li/Na, FeF2.2(OH)0.8 (FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08) and one Li (Na) atom, respectively.
After structural search (for details see Fig. S11 and S12 in the ESI), one can obtain the optimal position for the Li/Na ion occupation in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, respectively, as depicted in Fig. 8. For FeF2.2(OH)0.8, one Li atom is coordinated by two fluorine atoms and two oxygen atoms, forming two Li–F bonds and two Li–O bonds (only shown are Li–F bonds with bond lengths less than 2.20 Å, and 2.40 Å for Li–O bonds). As for Na occupation, the Na atom prefers to occupy the hollow site with a binding energy of −3.24 eV. And the newly formed five Na–O bond lengths vary from 2.59 Å to 2.77 Å. In the case of FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, the corresponding Li and Na binding energies are −2.80 eV and −2.99 eV, respectively.
The optimal position for the Li/Na ion occupation. (a) Li ion in FeF2.2(OH)0.8; (b) Na ion in FeF2.2(OH)0.8; (c) Li ion in FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08; (d) Na ion in FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08. Binding energies are also presented at the bottom of each configuration.
Two Li–F bonds and one Li–O bond form for the case of Li occupation. With Na occupying the hollow site in FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, only four Na–F bonds are formed. Interestingly, by analysis of binding energy and coordination number of Na in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, it is found that a larger Na coordination number is likely to induce smaller binding energy, resulting in the most stable structure of Na occupation. A similar phenomenon can also be observed in the case of Li occupation in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08. Next, excellent thermal stabilities of Li/Na in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 have been further verified via ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations with the NVT ensemble and a Nose–Hoover thermostat at 300 K (ref. 60 and 61) (for details see Fig. S13–S16 in the ESI). Besides, it becomes more and more difficult for Li/Na intercalation in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 with increasing Li/Na concentration (for details see Fig. S17 in the ESI).
After the determination of stable systems with Li/Na atoms, we further investigated the Li/Na-ion diffusion process to obtain the mobility of Li/Na ions in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, aiming to examine the effect of V0OH on the Li/Na-ion diffusion kinetics in FeF2.2(OH)0.8. After an intensive search, optimal Li/Na-ion diffusion paths in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 are all obtained (for details see Fig. S18–S23 in the ESI). As a whole, due to a smaller coordination number in the initial structure than that in the final structure (see Fig. S18,9a and b), Li/Na-ions hop from the initial state, via the saddle point, to a more stable final state, implying the thermodynamically spontaneous hopping process. Accordingly, in FeF2.2(OH)0.8, the Li-ion and Na-ion migration energy barriers are 0.33 eV and 0.20 eV, respectively. With the introduction of V0OH, the Li-ion and Na-ion migration energy barriers are reduced to 0.23 eV and 0.11 eV in FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, respectively. In order to clarify the reason for the lower Li/Na migration energy barrier in FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, we further compared and analyzed their local atomic structures and coordinated conditions of Li/Na at saddle points in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 (see Fig. S19 and 9c). For the case of Na diffusion, as depicted in Fig. 9, it is observed that the Na atom has a coordination number of three and the Na–F bond lengths are 2.23 Å, 2.49 Å and 2.50 Å, respectively. However in FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, the coordination number of Na increases to four, and the corresponding Na–F bond lengths are 2.39 Å, 2.41 Å, 2.50 Å and 2.59 Å, respectively, which induces sodium ions to be located in a static equilibrium, resulting in a lower migration energy barrier than that in FeF2.2(OH)0.8. Therefore, Na ions can still migrate faster in spite of their larger coordination number. Similarly, the same mechanism occurs in the process of Li-ion diffusion in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, which leads to FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 possessing the lower migration energy barrier than FeF2.2(OH)0.8 (for details see Fig. S20 and S21 in the ESI). Based on the above discussions, it is confirmed that the Li/Na migration energy barrier in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 can be significantly reduced by introducing V0OH. As a result, higher ionic conductivity appears in FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 than in FeF2.2(OH)0.8 (6.88 × 10−2 S cm−1vs. 2.03 × 10−2 S cm−1 for Na and 5.16 × 10−4 S cm−1vs. 1 × 10−6 S cm−1 for Li). Moreover, these ultrahigh ionic conductivities imply that the rate performance of FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 is much better than that of other focused high-rate cathode materials for Li/Na batteries, such as α-Li6Zn(P2O7)2 (2 × 10−12 S cm−1vs. Li+),62 FeF3·0.33H2O (2.4 × 10−8 S cm−1vs. Li+),25 Li10GeP2S12 (1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1vs. Li+),63 Na3TiP3O9N (4 × 10−7 S cm−1vs. Na+),64 NASICON-type Na3.4Sc2(SiO4)0.4(PO4)2.6 (4 × 10−3 S cm−1vs. Na+)65 and Na3PSe4 (1.16 × 10−3 S cm−1vs. Na+).66 That is to say, it is very feasible to obtain FeF2.2(OH)0.8 with ultra-high rate performance by introducing V0OH.

3.6Theoretical voltage and capacity
Besides rate performance, cycle life and voltage also are important electrode parameters to measure the electrochemical performance of Li/Na batteries.67,68 Accordingly, we further calculated the theoretical voltage (Vave) with increasing Li/Na concentration (x), aiming to obtain the relationship between Vave and Li/Na concentration (x).
The theoretical voltage (Vave) curves of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 and FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 as a function of adatoms’ (Li/Na) specific capacity are shown in Fig. 10a and b, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10a, as for FeF2.2(OH)0.8, it is noted that a very close agreement of initial discharge voltage between the experimental value40 and our calculated result occurs (3.30 V vs. 3.40 V). Moreover, the calculated discharge voltage curve still remains very close to the experimental value40 with increasing Li concentration. Interestingly, as for FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, our results are consistent with the experimental values40. In other words, the general excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental voltage trends further verifies that our structural model and computational method are reasonable. Compared with the discharge curves of FeF2.2(OH)0.8, evidently, FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 shows higher theoretical voltage and the variation of discharge voltage is smaller across the wide range of Li concentration, which indicates that FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 can provide a more stable voltage profile than FeF2.2(OH)0.8 in Li-ion batteries. That is to say, V0OH plays a key role in the design of FeF2.2(OH)0.8-based cathode materials with high voltage and long-life energy density in Li-ion batteries. Due to the outstanding role of V0OH in the effect of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 on the process of lithium storage, next, we turn to investigate its regulation role in the electrochemical properties of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 during sodium storage. In Fig. 10b, the discharge voltage of FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08, together with that of FeF2.2(OH)0.8, is clearly illustrated with increasing Na concentration. It is worth noting that V0OH also has an important effect of improving the voltage and cycle life of FeF2.2(OH)0.8 according to the more stable discharge curve of FeF2.2(OH)0.64O0.08□0.08 than that of FeF2.2(OH)0.8.
