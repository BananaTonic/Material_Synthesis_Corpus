2.Experimental section
2.1Materials
Graphite powder (99.99%, mesh size &lt;150 µm), sodium nitrate, hydrogen peroxide and aniline were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich India. Potassium permanganate and ammonium persulphate (APS) were purchased from Merck Limited, Mumbai, India, and phosphorylated cardanol was prepared by the phosphorylation of cardanol (the distilled product of CNSL which is obtained from the cashew export promotion council, India) as per the procedure reported earlier from our group.23 All solvents used were analytical grade and were taken as such.
2.2Preparation of graphene oxide (GO)
GO was prepared from a graphite powder by a modified Hummers' method.15 5 g of graphite (0.416 mol) and 2.5 g of NaNO3 (0.029 mol) were mixed with 108 mL H2SO4 (18 N) and 12 mL H3PO4 and stirred in an ice bath for 10 min. Later, 15 g of KMnO4 (0.0949 mol) was slowly added to the mixture and the temperature was maintained below 50 °C. Then the suspension was stirred for 2 h and the temperature was increased to 40 °C and kept at this level for 60 min and then the temperature was again increased to 98 °C and maintained for 60 min. Later, 400 mL of deionized (DI) water was added to this system and subsequently 15 mL of H2O2 was added and stirred well for 30 min. Finally the reaction product was centrifuged and washed with DI water repeatedly and the product was dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 12 h.
2.3Modification of GO with 3-PDPP (GPC)
Modification of GO with 3-PDPP was carried out as follows: 2 g of GO (0.16 mol) was dispersed in 50 mL of alcohol and sonicated for 1 h to obtain a uniform solution, and then 0.5 g of 3-PDPP (0.001 mol) in 50 mL of toluene was added dropwise to the system, and the resulting mixture was refluxed for 12 h at 80 °C. After cooling to room temperature and centrifugation, the residue was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. The brownish residue formed was designated GPC.
2.4Preparation of the PANI–GPC nanocomposites (PGPCs)
Conductive PGPCs were prepared with varying weight ratios of aniline and GPC through the same procedure and are designated PGPC1, PGPC2, PGPC3 and PGPC4 and the experimental details are given in the ESI in Table S1. In a typical procedure, 0.1 g GPC was dispersed in 100 mL of distilled water. Aniline (2 g) was added to the GPC dispersion and stirred for half an hour in order to form the aniline–GPC adduct. Later, APS was added to the adduct to initiate the polymerisation to form the PGPC. It changed the colour from brown to emerald green due to formation of the conductive PGPC. For comparison, PANI prepared without the presence of GO was used.
2.5Fabrication of symmetrical supercapacitors
10 wt% of PGPC in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) was prepared and coated on two indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates and dried in an air oven at 60 °C to form thin films of PGPC. Symmetrical supercapacitors were fabricated by sandwiching porous Whatman filter paper soaked in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte between these two electrodes. Similarly a second type of supercapacitor fabricated using a PVA–H3PO4 gel electrolyte (prepared by dissolving PVA powder (1 g) in 10 mL DI water and 85% H3PO4 (2 mL)) as the electrolyte between ITO–PGPC electrodes. The specific capacitance, energy density, power density and cycling stability of the fabricated supercapacitors were then evaluated using the galvanostatic charge–discharge technique.
