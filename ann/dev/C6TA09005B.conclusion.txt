Conclusions
We have successfully developed a strategy to prepare a mechanically strong and ion conductive monolith membrane as a novel separator for lithium ion batteries by taking advantage of both epoxy resin-based mesoporous monolithic structures and reinforcement by the incorporation of well-dispersed CNFs. The pore size of the monolith membranes prepared via the polymerization induced phase separation process between sacrificial layers changed drastically from macropores (&gt;100 nm) to mesopores (10–50 nm) as the addition of the diblock copolymer PGMA-b-PHEMA increased. Regarding the polymer monolith materials, a large internal surface area was achieved for mesoMMs in the range of 50–100 m2 g−1.
The utility of monolith membranes as separators for LIBs was examined by using tensile tests, TGA, and ionic conductivity measurements. Three promising characteristics were found: (i) the mesoMM reinforced with CNFs showed a Young's modulus over 0.6 GPa, (ii) the monolith membranes were thermally resistant up to at least 200 °C, and (iii) the ionic conductivity of the monolith membranes was comparable to those of commonly used polyolefin separators. The monolith membranes can be used as separators for LIBs, fuel cells and so on.
