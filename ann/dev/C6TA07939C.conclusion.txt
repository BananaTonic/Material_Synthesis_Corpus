Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized for the first time a 3D anionic porous metalloring organic framework (MROF-1), which possesses attractive structural and topological features such as novel [In6(thb)6] metalloring nodes with the largest diameter of ca. 21 Å among the reported MROF materials, unprecedented sextuply interlocked nanocages, a 3D self-catenated framework and an original 12-c topology net. In particular, MROF-1 exhibits a high proton conductivity up to 1.72 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 70 °C and 97% RH, which is higher than that of most of the dimethyl ammonium-contained MOFs and comparable to the highest proton conductivity of existing MOF materials under hydrated conditions. Our investigation thus not only provides a new route and further insights for the design and synthesis of metalloring clusters with a large internal cavity size, but also develops MROF materials as a new functional material platform for fuel cells.
