4.Conclusion
In this work, a new flexible stand-alone all-solid-state chemically linked hybrid MOF-polymer electrolyte film has been successfully synthesized by a simple one-pot photopolymerization with postsynthetic modification of the MOF, PEGDA and lithium salt and is used in LIBs for the first time. The prepared hybrid MOF-polymer electrolyte shows high ionic conductivity and superior interfacial contact with the electrode. The ionic conductivity of the hybrid electrolyte (HSPE-1-8) can reach 4.31 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C, which is over 5 times higher than that of the pure polymer electrolyte (P-PEGDA, free from MOFs) under the same conditions. Moreover, the assembled Li/HSPE-1-8/LFP cells with the hybrid covalently linked MOF-polymer electrolyte exhibit outstanding cycle performance and excellent rate properties. The average discharge specific capacity is 151 mA h g−1 at 60 °C (0.5C) with a coulombic efficiency close to 100% in the whole cycles. The average specific discharge capacities are 151, 146, and 102 mA h g−1 at the C-rates of 0.5, 1 and 2C (60 °C), respectively. The superior rate capacity and long cycle performance of the Li/HSPE-1-8/LFP cell have also been demonstrated at RT (discharge capacity reaches 80 mA h g−1 at 1C, initial discharge capacity is 140 mA h g−1 at 0.2C and the retention of specific capacity is 121 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles). The excellent electrochemical properties, along with the facile preparation process, make the novel MOF-based hybrid all-solid-state electrolyte very promising for RT all-solid-state LIBs.
