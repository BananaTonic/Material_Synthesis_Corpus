Preparation of side-chain-type AEMs
Synthesis of (ω-bromoalkyl)trimethylammonium bromide (Br-n-QA)
Br-n-QA was synthesized according to the literature with some modifications.28 The synthetic route for preparing Br-n-QA (n = 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12), where n is the number of carbon atoms linking the –Br groups and QA groups, is shown in Scheme 1. Taking Br-6-QA as an example, 24.4 g (100 mmol) of 1,6-dibromohexane and 150 mL of THF were placed into a 500 mL three-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. Trimethylamine gas was produced by heating trimethylamine solution at a certain temperature and then was introduced into the flask at a rate of 12 mL min−1 at RT for 4 h through a glass tube which extended below the surface of the reaction solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 24 h to obtain a white precipitate. The precipitate was filtered and washed with THF several times, followed by vacuum drying at RT for 24 h to give a product. Br-n-QA (n = 3, 4, 8 and 12) was synthesized using the same method. The chemical structure of the products was characterized using 1H NMR spectra in DMSO-d6.

Synthesis of hydroxyl-containing poly(ether sulfone) (PES-OH)
PES-OH was synthesized from methoxyl-containing poly(ether sulfone) (PES-OCH3) via the demethylation reaction as our previous report.29 A typical procedure for preparing PES-OCH3 is described as follows (Scheme 1). To a 100 mL three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, a Dean–Stark trap and a nitrogen inlet/outlet, 5.0850 g of FPS (20 mmol), 1.0087 g of BPHF (3 mmol), 2.3824 g of MHQ (17 mmol), 5.5284 g of K2CO3 (40 mmol), 55 mL of DMAc and 15 mL of toluene were mixed and heated to 140 °C for 4 h, followed by heating up to 155 °C for another 18 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT and poured into a large excess of methanol solution to precipitate the copolymers. The product was filtered and washed with methanol thoroughly and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h (yield: 96%).
For preparing PES-OH, 5.000 g of PAES-OCH3 was dissolved into 100 mL of chloroform to form a solution in a 250 mL three-necked flask with a magnetic stirrer and a nitrogen inlet/outlet. 4 mL of BBr3 was added dropwise into the PAES-OCH3 solution at RT. After reaction for 12 h, the resulting precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly with a large excess of methanol. Then, the solid was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h (yield: 88%).
Synthesis of quaternary ammonium-functionalized poly(ether sulfone)s (PES-n-QA)
Scheme 1 shows the procedure for preparing PES-n-QA (n = 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12). Typically, the synthesis of PES-6-QA is given as an example. 1 g of PES-OH (2.2858 mmol –OH) and 20 mL of DMSO were placed into a 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a condenser and a gas inlet/outlet. The mixture was heated to 90 °C with stirring until all the polymer was completely dissolved to form a brown homogeneous solution. Then, Br-6-QA (1.0392 g, 3.4287 mmol), K2CO3 (0.6318 g, 4.5716 mmol) and KI (0.0379 g, 0.2283 mmol) were added and the reaction was continued at 90 °C for 24 h. After cooling to RT, the copolymer was precipitated in acetone and washed with acetone and water several times to remove residual DMSO and other salts, followed by vacuum drying at 80 °C for 24 h to yield a light brown solid (yield: 95%).
Fabrication of membranes
The PES-6-QA (1 g) was dissolved in DMF (20 mL) to form a 5 wt% solution. The resulting solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter and was then cast onto four glass plates and dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 24 h to make the PES-6-QA membranes in bromide form. The resulting membranes were peeled off and immersed in a 1 M KOH solution at RT for 48 h to make the hydroxide form PES-6-QA membranes, followed by repeatedly washing with deionized (DI) water to remove any residual free ions and immersing in DI water for more than 48 h before use.
Characterization
1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded at 500 MHz on a Bruker AV500 spectrometer using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. The molecular weight of the copolymers was determined using a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) system (Waters, USA) using THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Sigma, Zeiss, Germany) was used to observe the morphology of the membranes. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the AEMs were captured on a DI Multimode V microscope (Bruker Co.) in a tapping mode at ambient temperature with a relative humidity of ∼60%. The characterization of the AEMs by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was carried out on a SAXSee-MC2 X-ray diffractometer (Anton Paar, Austria) under vacuum at RT. The membranes were placed under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h before measurements.
Measurements
Ion exchange capacity
Ion exchange capacity (IEC) was measured by both 1H NMR spectroscopy and the back titration method. A hydroxide form membrane was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h and then immersed in 30 mL of a 0.1 M HCl standard solution for 48 h. Subsequently, the solution was neutralized with a 0.1 M KOH solution using phenolphthalein as the indicator. The IEC of the membranes can be calculated from eqn (1).1where m (g) is the weight of the dry membranes, and M1 and M2 are the initial and final amount of H+ in the HCl solution, respectively.
Water uptake and the swelling ratio
Water uptake and the swelling ratio were measured after drying the hydroxide form membranes under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. The dried membranes were immersed in DI water at a certain temperature for 24 h. Subsequently, the mass and length/thickness of the membranes were recorded. The water uptake of the membranes is calculated by2where md is the mass of the dry membranes and mw is the mass of the wet membranes. The number of absorbed water molecules around each QA group (λ) is calculated by3
The in-plane and through-plane swelling of the membranes is estimated by the difference between the wet and dry dimensions in the length or thickness direction, which can be calculated by45where Lw and Ld are the length of the wet and dry membranes, and Tw and Td are the thickness of the wet and dry membranes, respectively.
Hydroxide conductivity
The hydroxide conductivity (σ, mS cm−1) of the membrane sample (size: 1 cm × 3 cm) is calculated by6where d is the distance between the reference electrodes (here 1 cm), and A is the cross-sectional area of the membrane (cm2). The membrane impedance R (kΩ) was recorded on a Parstat 263 electrochemical workstation (Princeton Advanced Technology, USA) over the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz using the two-point probe alternating current technique. The hydroxide conductivity measurements were carried out under a fully hydrated condition by placing the cell into DI water (degassing treatment) to equilibrate at least for 2 h and then to record the impedance spectrum.
Water state analysis
The water state of the AEMs was studied using a low temperature differential scanning calorimeter (DSC; HT-DSC 404, Netzsch, Germany). Before measurement, the excess water in the surface of the fully hydrated membrane samples was removed. The membrane sample was cooled to −20 °C and then heated to 20 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The amount of free water can be calculated by the integral area of the endothermic peaks near 0 °C using the fusion enthalpy of water (334 J g−1).30,31 The amount of bound water can be calculated by subtracting the free water from the total amount of water.
Mechanical properties and thermal stability
Mechanical properties were measured on an Instron 3343 universal testing machine with a stretching rate of 5 mm min−1 under ambient conditions. The membrane samples were cut into a dog-bone-shape (5.0 mm × 2.0 mm in the gauge area). The wet membranes were obtained by keeping them in DI water for at least 24 h.
The thermal decomposition of the membrane samples was investigated on a thermogravimetric analyzer (SDT-Q600, TA instruments, USA). Prior to measurements, the samples were dried in an oven under vacuum at 120 °C to a constant weight. The thermal decomposition data were recorded in the temperature range from 50 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Alkaline stability
The alkaline stability of the AEMs was determined by immersing the membrane samples into a 1 M aqueous KOH solution at 60 °C. During the test, the hydroxide conductivity and 1H NMR spectra were monitored. Prior to measurements, the membranes were washed with DI water and kept in DI water at RT for at least 48 h to remove residual KOH solution.
Membrane electrode assembly fabrication and fuel cell performance
The catalyst ink was prepared by mixing the Pt/C catalyst (40 wt%, Johnson Matthey Co.) with PES-6-QA ionomer solution (5 wt%), water and ethanol. The mass ratio of the dried ionomer to catalyst was controlled to be 2 : 8. Afterward, the catalyst inks were sprayed onto both sides of the PES-6-QA membrane with a thickness of 45 μm to prepare the catalyst-coated membranes (CCMs). The Pt loading in both the anode and cathode was 0.5 mg cm−2. The effective area of the electrodes was 4 cm2. The resulting CCMs were sandwiched between two pieces of carbon paper (Toray TGP-H-060, Japan), followed by hot-pressing at 5 MPa and RT for 5 min to fabricate the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). The H2/O2 fuel cell performance of the MEA was tested on a fuel cell test system at 60 °C. The flow rate of fully humidified H2 and O2 gases was controlled at 100 mL min−1.
