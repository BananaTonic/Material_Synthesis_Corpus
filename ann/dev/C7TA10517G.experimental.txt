Synthesis of LLTO nanofibers
Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning and subsequent calcination processes. For the electrospinning solution, 3.3 mmol lithium nitrite (LiNO3, Sigma-Aldrich), 5.6 mmol lanthanum nitrite hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mmol titanium butoxide (Ti(OC4H9)4, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in a 20 ml solvent mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich)/acetic acid (CH3COOH, Sigma-Aldrich) (8 : 2 by volume) and kept under magnetic stirring for 30 min. Then 2 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1 300 000, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and a yellow transparent solution was formed after stirring overnight. Precursor nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning of the mixture solution at a high voltage of 15 kV with a feeding rate of 0.75 ml h−1. The distance between the stainless-steel needle and aluminum collector was fixed at 15 cm. The as-spun nanofibers were subsequently calcined at different temperatures of 700, 800 and 900 °C for 2 h in air with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
Synthesis of the LLTO nanofiber filled PEO/LiTFSI solid composite polymer electrolyte
A salt solution was first prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide lithium (LiTFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) in 17.1 g acetonitrile (CH3CN, Sigma-Aldrich). LLTO nanofibers with 10, 15 and 20 wt% (based on the total weight of PEO and LiTFSI) were added into the above solution and were sonicated for 10 min. Then 1 g poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, Mw = 600 000, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the weight ratio of PEO/LiTFSI was fixed at 2 : 1. After magnetically stirring overnight, the mixture was then directly dropped onto the stainless-steel spacer (1.89 cm2, MTI). Solid composite electrolytes were obtained after drying under vacuum at 60 °C overnight to completely remove the solvent.
Structure characterization
Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA, Perkin Elmer Pyris 1) was conducted under an air atmosphere with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 to examine the LLTO ceramic nanofiber formation during the calcination process. Scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, FEI Verios 460L, USA) and aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, FEI Titan 80-300, USA) were used to identify the morphology of the LLTO nanofibers. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted with a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (Japan) with CuKα radiation (1.5418 Å) in a 2θ range of 10° to 80°. Diffraction data were acquired using a step size and count time of 0.05° 2θ and 3 s per step, respectively.
Electrochemical performance characterization
For the ionic conductivity measurements, a dried solid composite electrolyte membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and this was done for each solid composite electrolyte membrane. Measurements were conducted on three samples for each composition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out using Gamry Reference 600 devices from 1 MHz to 1 Hz at an AC voltage of 5 mV. For the linear sweep voltammetry tests, lithium metal was used as the counter and reference electrode while stainless steel was the working electrode. The tests were conducted at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Symmetric Li/solid composite electrolyte/Li cells were prepared using Li foil as the electrodes and were tested at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 at 25 °C. The cells were run for 0.5 h in each cycle. The assembly was carried out in an argon filled glove box.
