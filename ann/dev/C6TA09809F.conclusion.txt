4.Conclusions
Na3+xMxP1−xS4 phases with various tetravalent dopants M = Ge4+, Ti4+, Sn4+ (x = 0, 0.1) have been prepared using ball milling followed by annealing at 250 °C. In line with our parallel computational studies, we find the highest sodium ionic conductivity when using Sn as the dopant Na3.1Sn0.1P0.9S4. The computational studies also demonstrate that the overcrowding of Na sites is more important than the transition from tetragonal to cubic symmetry in enhancing the ionic conductivity and that the effective migration barrier will in this compound slightly decrease with increasing dopant size. The high potential of Sn-doped cubic Na3PS4 as a solid electrolyte is demonstrated by realising for the first time a full cell all-solid-state sodium ion battery with a first discharge capacity near the theoretical cathode capacity of 113 mA h g−1 both at room temperature (when cycled with 0.1C) and at 80 °C (when cycled at a 2C rate). Over 100 cycles with the 2C rate, 80% of the capacity is retained at 80 °C, while the two previous reports in the literature on full all-solid state cells could only demonstrate up to 10 or 26 cycles, respectively, and worked only at high temperatures. All components of our cell are stable beyond 250 °C with moderate thermal expansion &lt;3%, so that the cell should be able to operate over such a wide temperature range.
