Conclusion
In summary, ceramic LLTO nanofibers with a high aspect ratio were successfully prepared by simple electrospinning and subsequent calcination processes. LLTO nanofibers were further dispersed into a PEO polymer to fabricate the PEO/LLTO composite solid polymer electrolytes. Incorporation of the LLTO nanofibers in the PEO matrix has significantly influenced the overall performance of the solid composite polymer electrolytes: LLTO nanofibers, with a high aspect ratio, provided continuous ionic conductive pathways for ion transport and they simultaneously limited the recrystallization kinetics of the PEO chains and maintained the lower crystallization of the PEO matrix. Hence, the PEO/LiTFSI/LLTO composite electrolyte, with 15 wt% LLTO nanofibers with respect to the total PEO and LiTFSI amount, showed a high ionic conductivity of 2.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, which is nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of the bare PEO/LiTFSI polymer electrolyte. In addition, for the PEO/LiTFSI/LLTO composite electrolyte, a considerably enlarged electrochemical stability window was achieved, which could endure up to 5 V vs. Li/Li+ and could satisfy most lithium based batteries. Therefore, it is demonstrated that the PEO/LiTFSI/LLTO composite solid electrolyte, with high ionic conductivity and a large electrochemical stability window, opens an opportunity for next-generation high-energy density and safe lithium batteries.
