Experimental
Synthesis of Mo2C nanosheets and the Mo2C/CC composite
Firstly, 0.726 g Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.198 g glucose and 1 g NaCl were dissolved in 20 ml deionized water under ultrasonic treatment. Then the mixture was magnetically stirred and heated to 80 °C until the evaporation of solvent. The obtained brown precipitate was then annealed at 800 °C for 2 h under nitrogen flow. Finally, the annealed product was purified with water and ethanol through centrifugation. The flexible carbon cloth based Mo2C/CC composite was assembled through in situ growth of Mo2C during the above reaction. The carbon cloth (2 cm × 3 cm) was ultrasonically washed with acetone, deionized water, and ethanol, respectively, and then acidified with nitric acid.
Sulfur loading on a Mo2C based substrate
Mo2C and sublimed sulfur were mixed with different weight ratios of 2 : 8, 3 : 7 and 4 : 6. Afterwards, the mixture was ground and annealed in a tube furnace at 155 °C for 4 h under nitrogen flow.
Sulfur loading on the Mo2C/CC composite
The sulfur CS2 solution (5 mg mL−1) was added dropwise onto the Mo2C/CC substrate and dried at 40 °C. Then the sulfur containing Mo2C/CC substrate was further annealed at 155 °C for 4 h under a nitrogen atmosphere.
Synthesis of polysulfides (Li2S6)
In a typical synthesis, sublimed sulfur and lithium sulfide were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a molar ratio of 5 : 1 under stirring. A yellow powder precipitate was obtained after drying at 35 °C. All procedures were conducted in an Ar-filled glovebox.
Polysulfide adsorption study and XPS/Raman sample preparation
A Li2S6 solution was prepared by dissolving Li2S6 in THF. Then, 30 mg of Super P and 30 mg of Mo2C powder were separately added to the Li2S6 solution under stirring. The mixtures were allowed to settle down to observe the color change. As a comparison, the same Li2S6 solution was filled in a blank vial without any addition. To prepare the XPS and Raman samples, Mo2C powder was added to the Li2S6 solution under stirring. Solid Li2S6/Mo2C was collected after drying at 35 °C. All procedures were conducted in an Ar-filled glovebox.
Characterization of the materials
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of Mo2C were recorded through a Philips PW3040/60 X-ray diffractometer using Cu K radiation at a scanning step of 0.06° s−1 over the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron micro-analyzer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were conducted with a JEM-2100F field-emission TEM. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed with a spectroscope attached to the HRTEM. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the Mo2C was conducted on a thermal analyzer (Pyris 1 TGA) in the temperature range from 50 °C to 700 °C under air flow. Surface areas and pore size distribution of the products were calculated by using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms via the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, AUTOSORB-IQ2-MP) method at 77 K. The conductivity of Mo2C was determined by a custom-built 4-point probe measurement. For XPS, the analysis was performed on an ADES 400 instrument, operating with an Mg Kα radiation source and an ultra-high vacuum. Raman spectra were measured using a LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer system (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
Electrochemical measurements
The Li–S batteries were assembled using both CR2025-type coin cells and soft-package batteries in an Ar-filled glovebox. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were conducted in a voltage range from 1.8 to 2.6 V with the LAND battery cycler test system. Current density and specific capacity were calculated based on the mass of the S active material. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of the electrode were performed on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, China) in the potential window from 1.8 to 2.6 V and at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz with an amplitude of 5 mV.
