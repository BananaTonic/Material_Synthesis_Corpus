Experimental
Preparation of pure NiCo2O4
All the chemicals (analytical reagent) could be directly used without further purification. 3 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 6 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.35 g of Na2C2O4 and 3.5 g of C6H12N4 were dissolved in 300 mL deionized water, and heated at 90 °C with stirring for 12 h. Then, the NiCo2O4 nanosheets were collected by centrifugation. After washing with deionized water/ethanol several times and then drying at 45 °C for 12 h, accumulational NiCo2O4 nanosheets were prepared.
Preparation of checkerboard-like NiCo2O4/C/CNT nanosheets
The checkerboard-like NiCo2O4/C/CNT nanosheets were prepared via a first ultrasonic/freeze-drying treatment and a subsequent heat-treatment process. Firstly, 5 g wood-derived cellulose nanofiber was homogeneously dispersed in 500 mL of deionized water by ultrasonic treatment for 10 min. After freeze drying, cellulose with a 2D-nanonetwork structure was prepared and used as a raw material in the subsequent experiments. Then, 0.3 g obtained cellulose was dispersed in 100 mL deionized water by ultrasonic treatment for 3 min. Here, a cellulose suspension with a concentration of 3 mg mL−1 was prepared. Furthermore, 0.02 g multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs, Aladdin, Shanghai, China) and 0.3 g as-prepared NiCo2O4 were added to the 0.3 g cellulose suspension (100 mL, 3 mg mL−1) and dispersed by high-power ultrasonic treatment (Ultrasonic Cell Disruption System, JY99-IIDN, Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology Co. Ltd, China) for 5 min (weight (NiCo2O4) : weight (CNTs) = 15 : 1). After that, the suspension solution was placed in a refrigerator for 12 h. After freeze-drying treatment, a NiCo2O4@CNTs/cellulose aerogel was prepared. Then, the as-prepared NiCo2O4@CNTs/cellulose aerogel was heated at 800 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere, and annealed in flowing air for 12 h. The obtained NiCo2O4@C/CNT aerogel was named N@C/CNT-85.1. Meanwhile, NiCo2O4@carbon was prepared by the same processes without CNTs. For comparison, NiCo2O4/C/CNT nanosheets with different ratios of NiCo2O4 to CNTs (0.02 g of CNTs; 0.3 g of cellulose) of 0 : 1, 5 : 1, 10 : 1 and 20 : 1 were prepared by the same route, and named C/CNT nanosheets, N@C/CNT-61.4, N@C/CNT-77.6 and N@C/CNT-89.1, respectively. Moreover, pure carbon nanosheets were prepared by using pure cellulose nanosheets as the carbon source under a same carbonization process.
To further highlight the superior structure of N@C/CNTs, a NiCo2O4/CNT composite with a NiCo2O4 coated CNT structure was synthesized by a sample hydrothermal process. In this process, 0.1 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.2 g of Co(NO3)2·6H2O with 0.01 g oxidized CNTs were dispersed in 80 mL deionized water. The pH was adjusted to 9 by using NH3·H2O (5%). Then, this mixture was placed in a 100 mL Teflon-lined sealed autoclave, and heated at 70 °C for 12 h. After washing with deionized water and annealing at 250 °C for 12 h under air, the NiCo2O4/CNT composite was prepared.
Characterization
An emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Quanta FEG 250, FEI, USA) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20, FEI, USA) were used to observe the microstructure of the samples. The phase structure was determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, D/MAX 2200, Rigaku, JPN), and the surface elemental distribution was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250 XI, Thermo Fisher Co, USA). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra (4000–400 cm) were obtained by using a Nicolet 5700 Spectrometer by the KBr micro-tableting method. The NiCo2O4 content of composites was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Thermal Analysis Instruments, Burlington, MA, USA) at 10 °C in air. Raman spectra (LabRAM HR800, JY, Horiba) were collected with an excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm. The four-point probe method was used to measure the conductivity (Keithley 6220/2182A; Tektronix Co, USA). An Ultrasonic Cell Disruption System (JY99-IIDN, Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology Co. Ltd, China) with a power of 650 watts was used to prepare and disperse the samples. The obtained samples were freeze-dried with a freezer dryer (SCIENTZ-18ND, Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology Co. Ltd, China).
Electrochemical measurements
In the preparation processes of N@C/CNTs and C/CNT electrodes (Fig. S10), the as-prepared aerogels were placed on the nanocarbon-coated copper foil (Conductive Carbon Coated Copper Foil, Hefei Kejing materials technology co. led., China) at first. Then, excess N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) without other reagents was dropwise added into the aerogel that was neatly pressed flat by glass bar. The obtained sample was dried at 110 °C for 12 h, and then rolled in 20 MPa by roller press. After cutting into circles with a diameter of 12 mm, the mass loadings of N@C/CNT electrodes in this Cu foil were about 0.7–13 mg cm−2. For other electrodes (1.8–2.3 mg cm−2 of active materials), a homogeneous electrode slurry was prepared by mixing 80 wt% of active materials, 10 wt% of carbon black and 10 wt% of PVDF dispersed in N-menthylpyrrolidone (NMP). A CR2032-type coin half-cell was assembled by sandwiching the PP microfiber filter film between the working electrode and counter electrode (Li metal) in a glove box filled with high-purity Ar. The electrolyte used was 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1 : 1, v/v). The electrochemical performances of the cells were evaluated using a Land Battery Test System (5V1A, BT-2016A, LAND, China) in a potential range of 0.1–3.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on a CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments Co.).
