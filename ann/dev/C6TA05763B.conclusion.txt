4.Conclusion
Co-doped ceria with nominal compositions of the Ca0.04Ce0.96−xSmxO2−δ series (x = 0, 0.09, 0.16, and 0.24) has been prepared by a co-precipitation method. Sm co-doping reduced the particle sizes, but increased the ionic conductivities, and the Ca0.04Ce0.80Sm0.16O1.73 composition presented the highest ionic conductivity of 0.039 S cm−1 at 600 °C. Moreover, composite formation between the semiconductor LSCF and the ionic conductor SCDC significantly increases the ionic conductivity to 0.188 S cm−1 for the LSCF–SCDC2 composite at 600 °C. Due to the semiconductor/ionic conductor coupling effect, extra O aggregates in the LSCF–SCDC interface region and the depletion of oxygen vacancies in LSCF–SCDC and LSCF–LSCF grain boundaries is significantly mitigated, resulting in the enhancement of ionic conductivity of semiconductor–ionic LSCF–SCDC composites. Finally, the EFFC made from the LSCF–SCDC2 composite exhibits the highest output power density of 814 mW cm−2 at 550 °C.
