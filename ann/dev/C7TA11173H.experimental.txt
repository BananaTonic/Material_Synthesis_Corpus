Preparation of cross-linked ACM/MWCNT films
Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) (purity ≥95%, diameter &lt;8 nm) were obtained from Chengdu Organic Chemicals Co. Ltd. of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Acrylate rubber (ACM) Nipol AR51 was supplied by Nippon Zeon Co. Ltd. Japan. 1,5-Diaminoanthraquinone (purity ≥97%) was obtained from Alfa Aesar Co. Ltd. Aniline (purity ≥99.5%) was provided by Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co. Ltd. All reagents used were of analytical grade and used directly without any purification.
The cross-linked ACM/MWCNT films were prepared by a chemical cross-linking method. Firstly, MWCNTs with various weights (0.2, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, and 0.5 g) were dispersed in 25 ml N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), respectively. And the corresponding weight of ACM (0.8, 0.7, 0.65, 0.6, and 0.5 g) was dissolved in 15 ml DMAc, respectively. The total weight of ACM and MWCNTs was always kept at 1 g. Then, the above ACM solution, the MWCNT dispersion and 4 wt% (with respect to the weight of ACM) diethylenetriamine (DETA) were mixed under mechanical stirring for 12 h. After that, the homogenous solutions were left to stand for 20 min for deaeration and then cast onto PTFE plates. After being dried completely at room temperature, the ACM/MWCNT films were crosslinked at 80 °C for 48 h. Finally, the uncrosslinked part of the ACM/MWCNT films was removed by extraction with acetone in a Soxhlet apparatus and cleaned with deionized water and then freeze-dried.
Preparation of ACM/MWCNTs@PDAA and ACM/MWCNTs@PANI electrodes
Both ACM/MWCNTs@PDAA and ACM/MWCNTs@PANI film electrodes were prepared by an electropolymerization method. Prior to electropolymerization, ACM/MWCNT films were cleaned with ethanol. For the ACM/MWCNTs@PDAA anode, the ACM/MWCNT film of 1 cm × 1.5 cm, a Pt sheet of 2 cm × 2 cm, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode (containing 0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile, +0.300 V versus a saturated calomel electrode) were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (PDAA) was potentiostatically electropolymerized at +1.2 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) on the ACM/MWCNT film in an acetonitrile (AN) solution containing a 5 mM 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (DAA) monomer, 0.1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (Et4NBF4), and 0.5 M trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH) for different charge densities (1, 2 and 4 C cm−2). For the ACM/MWCNTs@PANI cathode, its preparation process is similar to that of the ACM/MWCNTs@PDAA anode, but the reaction was conducted at +1 V (vs. Ag/Ag+) in an acetonitrile (AN) solution containing 0.1 M aniline, 0.5 M CF3COOH and 0.1 M Et4NBF4 for different charge densities (1, 3 and 5 C cm−2). The electropolymerization was performed in an argon-filled glovebox.
Assembly of the organic asymmetric stretchable supercapacitor
Before assembling organic asymmetric stretchable supercapacitors (denoted as oASSCs), the ACM/MWCNTs@PANI cathode and ACM/MWCNTs@PDAA anode were immersed in 1 M Et4NBF4–AN. The cathode and anode were firstly laminated onto both sides of the ACM/Et4NBF4–AN quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte (QPE), and then two titanium foils were covered closely on the electrodes to function as current collectors, sealed by a PDMS membrane. The preparation process of the ACM/Et4NBF4–AN QPE is shown in the ESI. And the PDMS membrane was fabricated by vigorously mixing a silicone-elastomer base and curing agent (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) at a weight ratio of 10 : 1, followed by degassing in a vacuum oven for 30 min and thermal curing at 80 °C for 5 h. The whole assembly process was carried out in an argon-filled glovebox.
Characterization
The morphology of the samples was observed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a Smart OMNI Sampler. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The weight loss of the samples was measured using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, NET-ZSCH STA 449 C) from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The electronic conductivity of the samples was determined by using an SX 1934 four-probe instrument. The mechanical properties of the film electrodes were evaluated with a Zwick Roell testing system at a tensile speed of 5 mm min−1. The plastic deformation of the film electrodes after stretching–relaxation cycles was tested by using a Mark-10 ESM301 at a tensile speed of 10 mm min−1.
Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements of the electrodes were performed in a three-electrode mode and were conducted inside an Ar-filled glovebox. The as-prepared film electrodes were used directly as working electrodes with a Pt counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. CV, GCD and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of the oASSC devices were conducted on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation. Cycling stability was obtained using a program testing system (Land CT2001A). The volumetric specific capacitance, volumetric energy and volumetric power densities of the full oASSC device were calculated based on the total volumes of the two electrodes and the organic QPE.
