Experimental section
Materials
Iron(iii) sulfate [Fe2(SO4)3, 97%], sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8, ≥99.0%), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), cation exchange resin, anion exchange resin, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) were purchased from Aldrich Chemicals. Graphene platelet powder (N002-PDR, Angstron Materials) and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT; TMC220-10, Nano Solution) bundles were obtained. All solvents and chemical reagents were used as received without any further purification.
Preparation of PSS/carbon material dispersions
PSS was used as a dispersant for the graphene and MWCNTs, similar to our previous report.17 PSS was treated with a mixture of cation and anion exchange resins to eliminate extra ions before we utilized it as a dispersant. The desired amounts of carbon materials (0.12 g or 0.20 g) and PSS (4.0 g) were directly added to deionized water (580 g). The aqueous mixture of PSS/carbon materials was stirred for 30 min by ultrasonication with a tip sonicator in order to obtain a well-dispersed system of PSS/carbon materials. The samples were prepared with graphene (denoted as ‘G’), MWCNT (‘M’), or a 1 : 1 weight ratio of graphene/MWCNT mixture (‘G/M’). The carbon materials were 3 wt% or 5 wt% of PSS solid contents. The total composition of the carbon materials was limited to 5 wt% in our experiment, because nanocomposites with more carbon materials had a large amount of agglomerates in thin films.
In situ polymerization of PEDOT in the presence of PSS and carbon materials
The aqueous dispersion of PSS/carbon materials was bubbled with inert argon gas (99.999%) for 60 min at a rate of 3 L min−1 in order to remove the dissolved oxygen from the aqueous medium and minimize over-oxidation of EDOT units during the polymerization. The EDOT monomer (5.01 g) was added and mixed with a mechanical stirrer for 30 min in the dispersion. The oxidizing reagents of iron(iii) sulfate (0.20 g; 5.01 × 10−4 mol) and sodium persulfate (8.02 g; 3.45 × 10−2 mol) were dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water. The solutions were then added to the EDOT and PSS/carbon material dispersion to facilitate oxidative polymerization of EDOT in the presence of PSS and the carbon materials. The polymerization was carried out for 48 h at 5 °C with bubbling inert argon gas. After the polymerization, the composite product was blended with 300 mL of a mixture of bead-type cation and anion exchange resins for 1 h, followed by filtering through a 30 μm mesh. As a control sample, pristine PEDOT:PSS was also prepared without the addition of any carbon materials.
Characterization of PEDOT:PSS/carbon composites
In order to analyse the electrical and thermoelectric properties of the composites, thin films of the composites were prepared by the bar-coating method on a glass substrate. Prior to the deposition, the dispersion of the PEDOT:PSS/carbon material hybrid was mixed with DMSO and stirred for more than 1 h under ambient conditions to enhance the electrical conductivity.27 The as-coated thin films were dried at 150 °C for 2 min in a convection oven. The gold electrodes for measurement of the conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient were deposited onto the surface of the hybrid film with a distance of 10 mm to minimize the electrical contact resistance. The conductivity of the samples was obtained by the van der Pauw method using a home-built system. The Seebeck coefficient of the hybrid samples was measured by using two Peltier devices attached to an aluminum heat sink using a thermal paste to prevent thermal disturbance and to maintain a controlled temperature gradient across the thin films.
The Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained from the composite thin films by using an FT-IR spectrophotometer (TENSOR 27, Bruker) and an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV, RIGAKU), respectively. The electron binding energy of the composites was measured by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; K-alpha, Thermo U.K.) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Raman spectra of the composite films were obtained using a Raman spectrometer (LabRam Aramis, Horriba Jovin Yvon) using a Nd:Yag laser source with a wavelength of 532 nm. The thickness of the composite films was measured with a surface profiler (Alpha Step IQ, KLA-Tencor). The morphology of the composites was imaged by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEM-2010, JEOL Ltd.) operating at 200 kV. The thermal conductivity (κ) of the composites was obtained by using a laser flash apparatus (Netzsch LFA 457, MicroFlash Instruments Inc.) with a xenon flash lamp. The thermal conductivity is a function of the specific heat (Cp), thermal diffusivity (D), and density (ρ) of the material, according to the relationship: κ = CpDρ.
