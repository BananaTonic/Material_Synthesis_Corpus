Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized a broken linear sulfonate–carboxylate ligand and constructed a new stable Zr-based MOP using the SBUs of Cp3Zr3(μ3-O)(μ2-OH)3 and the ligand. The charged groups (–SO3−) on the organic ligands formed multiple charge-assisted H-bonds with the cationic SBUs, which greatly enhanced the stability of the whole structure (high thermal stability, and acid and alkali resistance). Multiple functions including highly selective CO2 capture and high proton conductivity of the porous materials are realized in one MOP, which enriches the study of MOP materials in these fields. The achievement will provide a new strategy for the preparation of new stable crystalline porous MOPs with the desired functionality.
