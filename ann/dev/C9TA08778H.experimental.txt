Experimental
Synthesis of the MnOOH@Al2O3 film
MnOOH nanowires were synthesized by a hydrothermal method.43 Typically, 21 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw: 55 000) and 42 mg of KMnO4 were dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water under continuous stirring for 0.5 h. Then, the solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and kept at 140 °C for 25 h. MnOOH nanowires were obtained by centrifugation separation and drying processes. The MnOOH nanowire film was fabricated by vacuum filtration of the solution with MnOOH nanowires. The thickness of the film can be regulated by controlling the amounts of MnOOH nanowires in the solution. Then, the hybrid film of MnOOH@Al2O3 was prepared by atomic layer deposition according to our previous reports.44
Synthesis of the HGPE
The HGPE was prepared by a solution casting method. Typically, poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) polymer (Mw: 400 000) was dissolved in acetone by vigorous stirring. Then, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), LiClO4, and LiNO3 were added into the solution and continuously stirred overnight. The resulting solution was cast onto a film of MnOOH@Al2O3 on a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate and dried at room temperature for three days to remove acetone solvent. For comparison, pure GPE was also fabricated in the absence of the film under the same conditions. The air electrode of Ni foam@Co3O4–RuO2 was prepared according to our previous report.45
Materials characterization
The thickness, structure, and composition of the HGPE were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi S-4800), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Tecnai G220), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) (D/Max-III-type, Cu Kα X-ray source).
Electrochemical measurements
Ni foam@Co3O4–RuO2 was free-standing and used as the cathode directly. The areal loading of the RuO2 catalyst is about 0.28 mg cm−2. The as-prepared HGPE serves as both the electrolyte and separator in quasi-solid-state cells. The electrochemical performances of Li–O2 batteries were evaluated by assembling Swagelok-type cells and tested on an Arbin battery testing system in 1 atm O2. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed on a Bio-Logic electrochemical workstation at open circuit potential.
