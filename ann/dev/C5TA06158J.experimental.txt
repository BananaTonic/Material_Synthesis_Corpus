Experimental
Preparation of Co9S8
Co9S8 compound was prepared using a high energy ball mill (FRITSCH PULVERISETTE-7) according to our previous work.38
Preparation of graphene oxide (GO)
Graphene oxide was prepared from natural flake graphite through the typical Hummer's method.39 The concentration of the GO suspension obtained was 1.0 mg mL−1, which was determined by drying 40 mL of the suspension at 60 °C under vacuum for 1 week and then weighing the dried GO.
Preparation of reduced graphene oxide (RGO)
RGO was synthesized using hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent.40 Typically, 40 mL GO suspension (C = 1.0 mg mL−1), hydrazine hydrate (20 μL, wt% = 80%, ρ = 1.03 g cm−3) and ammonium hydroxide (140 μL) were added into an airtight container (100 mL capacity). The mixture was kept at 90 °C for 1 hour, then washed with deionized water for several times after cooling to room temperature and finally dried by vacuum freeze-drying. The concentration of the RGO suspension was found to be 0.74 mg mL−1.
Preparation of the RGO/Co9S8 nanocomposite
Various RGO/Co9S8 nanocomposites with different weight ratios of RGO to Co9S8 were prepared by ball milling an appropriate amount of Co9S8 in the as-prepared RGO suspension in a ZrO2 vessel at a speed of 700 rpm for 6 h under an Ar gas atmosphere with a ball to powder weight ratio of 15 : 1. After that, the RGO/Co9S8 nanocomposite was collected by vacuum filtration, and freestanding papers were formed. The whole process is shown in Scheme 1.
Materials characterization
The crystal structures of the samples were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku D/max IIIA). The morphology of the Co9S8 and RGO/Co9S8 paper was investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6700) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI, Tecnai G2S-Twin). Raman spectra were obtained by using a Bruker Optics Senterra R200-L Raman scattering microscope with a laser wavelength of 663 nm. The electrical conductivity of the samples was measured using a Hall Effect Measurement System (Swim HALL8800, Chinese Taipei) at room temperature. The mechanical properties of the samples were measured using a commercial nanotensile testing system (Nano UTMTM Universal Testing System T150, Agilent Technologies).
Evaluation of electrochemical properties
The Co9S8 working electrodes were prepared by mixing 70 wt% of Co9S8 powder, 20 wt% of acetylene black, and 10 wt% of polyvinylidene difluoride binder in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurries were spread on copper foil substrates, and the coated electrodes were pressed after being dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 24 h.
The as-fabricated RGO/Co9S8 nanocomposite papers were directly used as the cathode in the electrochemical performance test. CR 2032-type coin cells used in the above two kinds of as-prepared electrodes were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box with lithium foil as the anode under moisture and oxygen concentrations below 1 ppm. The electrolyte used was 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1 : 1 in volume); microporous polypropylene paper (Celgard 2400) was used as the cell separator. The electrochemical properties of anodes were evaluated by a galvanostatic discharge/charge technique performed using a NEWARE battery tester at different current rates with a voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V (vs. Li+/Li). Electrochemical impedance spectra measurements were performed using an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 4000, Princeton, USA) on single cells under different discharge states from 100 kHz to 100 MHz.
