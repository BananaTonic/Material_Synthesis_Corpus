Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed and prepared a highly flexible, robust, and conductive paper anode based on the nanostructural RGO/Co9S8 nanocomposite for LIBs. Owing to the uniform distribution of Co9S8 nanoparticles on graphene that can improve the conductivity and accommodate volume expansion/shrinkage, this free-standing RGO/Co9S8 paper with a high tensile strength of 50.4 MPa can deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 1415 mA h gCo9S8−1 (944 mA h g−1electrode) and still maintain a reversible capacity of 573 mA h gCo9S8−1 (382.2 mA h g−1electrode) even after 500 cycles at a current density of 1C (1C = 545 mA g−1). These results suggest that the design of graphene with active materials to form robust and flexible paper brings new opportunities to construct free-standing electrodes for wearable and lightweight energy storage devices with high energy density.
