Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the preparation of 3C aerogels from waste paper using a general “oxidation-oven drying-carbonization” method, which is superior to the frequently used freeze drying approach. The 3C aerogels feature lightweight, high compressibility, electrical conductivity and oil absorption capacity. The 3C aerogels are superhydrophobic and superoleophilic, and are useful for the removal of free oils from water via different approaches. Moreover, the 3C aerogels are efficient for gravity-driven separation of water-in-oil emulsions and simultaneous adsorption of soluble organic pollutants in the emulsions. The 3C aerogels may also find applications in other fields including sensors, pressure-sensitive electronics and battery electrodes owing to their excellent properties. This work opens a new avenue for designing novel carbon aerogels. We believe that the findings in this study will shed light on the creation of new superwetting carbon aerogels for efficient oil/water separation.
