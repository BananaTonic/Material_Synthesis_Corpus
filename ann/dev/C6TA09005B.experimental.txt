Experimental
Materials
All reagents and solvents were used without further purification unless stated otherwise. The chemical structures of the reagents used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. 1,3-Bis(N,N′-diglycidylaminoethyl)cyclohexane (TETRAD-C, 98%) was purchased from Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc., Japan. Bis(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane (BACM) (mixture of isomers, 97%) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, partially hydrolyzed, degree of saponification: 86–90%, loss on drying at 105 °C: max. 6.0%) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan. Polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200, averaged molecular weight: 190–210) and 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC)–diethyl carbonate (DEC) (1 : 1, v/v, 99.5%) were used as received from Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan. Commercially available CNFs (2 wt% in water, mean diameter: 20–50 nm, specific surface area: 120 m2 g−1), namely BiNFi-s,21 were used as received from Sugino Machine Ltd., Japan. A block copolymer, poly(glycidyl methacrylate)-block-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PGMA-b-PHEMA), was supplied by Dainichiseika Color &amp; Chemicals Mfg. Co., Ltd., Japan and used after reprecipitation with hexane to remove any impurities. PGMA-b-PHEMA was prepared by successive addition of two monomers in living radical polymerization.22 The number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) of the first PGMA block was 3.8 × 103; it was determined via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and calibrated using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) standards (Shodex). The Mn of PGMA-b-PHEMA was 6.0 × 103, obtained from the results of GPC in THF, calibrated according to PMMA standards. The polydispersity index of PGMA-b-PHEMA was 1.5. For the GPC measurement, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was taken out during polymerization. PVA coated glass substrates were prepared as follows: a PVA solution in water (1.0 wt%) was spin-coated on a glass substrate (7.5 × 7.5 cm2) at 2000 rpm for 20 s, and the substrate was dried at 105 °C for 1 h.

Preparation of monolith membranes
Macroporous monolith membrane (macroMM)
BACM (0.575 g, 2.73 mmol) was completely dissolved in PEG200 (4.0 g) at 85 °C, followed by the addition of TETRAD-C (1.0 g, 2.73 mmol). The mixture was sonicated to remove any bubbles, placed on a PVA-coated glass substrate with spacers: polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) film (thickness ca. 10 μm), for achieving very thin membranes, as shown in Fig. 3, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) film (100 μm, NITOFLON films, Nitto Denko, Ltd., Japan) for tensile tests and ionic conductivity measurement, and then another PVA-coated glass substrate was placed on top to obtain a sandwich structure. The sample was clamped with double clips, heated at the prescribed temperature (70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130 °C) for 1 h in an oven, immersed in hot distilled water for 15 min, and finally washed with distilled water. The monolith membrane spontaneously detached from the substrate in water. Finally, the membrane was kept under vacuum overnight in order to complete the drying process to yield the macroMM.

Mesoporous monolith membrane (mesoMM)
The solution of varying amounts of PGMA-b-PHEMA in PEG200 was mixed with the solution of BACM and TETRAD-C in PEG200. The mixture was subjected to the same procedure as that for the synthesis of the macroMM to yield the mesoMM, taking into account the epoxy content of PGMA-b-PHEMA. The concentrations of BACM and TETRAD-C in PEG200 were the same as those used for the synthesis of the macroMM. The polymerization temperature was 110 °C. The obtained membrane is denoted as mesoMM-x, where x represents the weight percentage of PGMA-b-PHEMA against the monolithic framework.
CNF-reinforced monolith membrane (mesoMM–CNF)
First, commercially available CNFs in water were subjected to solvent exchange from water (1 wt%) to methanol, and then to PEG200, followed by extensive vacuum drying to remove all dissolved water and methanol, yielding a CNF slurry in PEG200 (3.85 wt%). Then, PGMA-b-PHEMA (0.16 g, 0.62 mmol against the glycidyl moiety), BACM (0.608 g, 2.89 mmol), and TETRAD-C (1.0 g, 2.73 mmol) were added to the solution of CNFs in PEG200 (4.5 g, content of CNFs = 0.16 g). Next, the mixture was defoamed by using a super stirrer (Awatori-rentaro, ARE-310, THINKY Ltd., Japan) to mix the solution homogeneously and to remove any bubbles. Finally, the sample was subjected to the same procedure as mentioned above for the macroMM, to obtain the CNF-reinforced mesoMM. The membrane is denoted as mesoMM-x–CNF-y, where x and y represent the amount of PGMA-b-PHEMA and CNFs against the monolith framework, respectively.
Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) observations were carried out on a JEOL JSM-6700F SEM operated at 1.5 kV. During the preparation of samples for cross-sectional observations, the membranes were fractured in liquid nitrogen to obtain fresh cross sections. Prior to SEM observations, the samples were sputter-coated with a thin layer of platinum to enhance their conductivity (Hitachi ion sputter E-1010); sputter time: 40 s; coat thickness: ca. 5 nm. The contact angle was measured using a DropMaster 700 (Kyowa Interface Sci. Co. Ltd., Saitama, Japan). Distilled water (2 μL) or PEG200 (2 μL) was dropped on a PVA-coated glass and an epoxy resin film, and the static contact angle was measured 1 s after dropping. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Shimadzu TGA-50H apparatus under a continuous flow of argon gas from 50 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Mercury porosimetry (AUTOPORE III, Micromeritics, USA) was used to characterize the macropores of the macroMM. The surface area was determined by the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) method using a BELSORP-mini II (MicrotracBEL Corp., Japan). Samples of approximately 100 mg were heated at 110 °C under vacuum for at least 3 h to remove adsorbed species. Nitrogen adsorption data were collected at 42 relative pressures from 0.001 to 0.99 at −196 °C, whereas desorption data were recorded at 27 relative pressures from 0.99 to 0.30 at −196 °C. The BET equation and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) scheme were used for calculating the specific surface area and the average pore width of the monolith membrane, respectively. The tensile mechanical strength of the monolith membranes was characterized using a commercial test machine (Tensilon RTG-1310, A&amp;D Co., Japan) with a 50 N load cell (UR-50N-D, A&amp;D Co.). Air jaws (J-JFAS-50N, A&amp;D Co.) with double cut faces (25 × 25 mm) (J-FFMD1-250N, A&amp;D Co.) were used as end taps. The average nominal elastic modulus (Young's modulus), tensile stress, and elongation at break were determined from the tensile stress–strain curves by using data processing and analytical software (TACT-STD, A&amp;D Co.). The nominal stress was obtained by dividing the tensile force by the initial cross-sectional area of the specimen. The elongation rate was 5 mm min−1 with a gauge length of 40 mm. The test specimens were 60 mm in length, 10 mm in width, and ca. 80 μm in thickness. The samples were dried under vacuum overnight prior to mechanical testing. A hot oven test was conducted for the determination of the thermal shrinkage of mesoMM-10–CNF-10 and a PP separator (Celgard®, monolayer polypropylene; 20 μm pores; high porous type commercial separator) at 180 °C for 10 min in an oven under an air atmosphere according to the procedure previously described with some modifications.23 The ionic conductivity of the monolithic separators was obtained by AC-impedance analysis using a multi-frequency LCR meter (Precision LCR meter E4980A, Agilent Technology Japan, Ltd., where LCR stands for inductance (L), capacitance (C), and resistance (R)). The monolith membrane used as a separator (thickness ca. 80 μm), soaked in 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte solution in EC–DEC, was mounted between two polished stainless-steel discs, which acted as ion-blocking electrodes, using polyimide-sheet spacers (70 μm), which determined the nominal gap between the stainless-steel discs. The assembly of all cells was carried out in an argon-filled glovebox (H2O &lt; 0.1 ppm). Just before the assembly, all parts for the ionic conductivity measurements including the monolith membrane were dried under vacuum overnight. The measurement cell was set in a thermostat oven chamber and data were collected at various frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 2 MHz, and at various temperatures (0, 10, 20, 30, and 45 °C for 1 M LiPF6 in EC–DEC; 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, and 45 °C for mesoMM-10–CNF-10). The stabilization time was at least 1 h during heating and 1.5 h during cooling. The ionic conductivity data were calculated as d/RS, where d and S are the thickness and superficial area of the monolith samples and R is the bulk resistance.
