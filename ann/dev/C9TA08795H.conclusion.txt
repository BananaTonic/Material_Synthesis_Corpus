4.Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated a novel flexible SIPE (LFPP@PVDF SIPE) with ultra-high ionic conductivity and excellent electrochemical performances. The LFPP@PVDF SIPE exhibited a very high ionic conductivity of up to 5.81 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature, wide electrochemical stability up to 5.2 V, and a lithium transference number of 0.91. To our knowledge, this ionic conductivity is among the highest ionic conductivities exhibited by SIPEs reported to date. The lithium plating/stripping performance of Li|SIPE|Li cells was very stable at 1 mA cm−2 for over 1400 h at room temperature. More importantly, the LFP/Li cell using the prepared single-ion conducting electrolyte as the electrolyte and separator demonstrates excellent long-term stability and reliability without obvious decay after 230 cycles at 0.2C at room temperature.
