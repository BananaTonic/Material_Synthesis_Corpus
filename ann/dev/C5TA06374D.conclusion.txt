Conclusions
In the present study, the LiPON/A-LLTO was successfully employed as a solid electrolyte in the non-aqueous Li–O2 cell. The Li–O2 cell containing the Li metal electrode protected by LiPON/A-LLTO exhibited significantly enhanced cycling stability with the cycle life of 128 cycles under the limited capacity mode of 1000 mA h g−1 within the potential range of 2.0 to 4.5 V compared with the cell without LiPON/A-LLTO exhibiting the cycle life of 47 cycles. Impedance, SEM, and XPS analyses confirmed that the improved cycle life of the Li–O2 cell using the protected Li metal electrode with LiPON/A-LLTO resulted from the effective suppression of lithium dendrite growth by the mechanical strength, as well as the suppression of electrolyte decomposition due to the prevention of the diffusion of oxygen and other contaminants from the oxygen electrode side during the operation of the Li–O2 cell.
