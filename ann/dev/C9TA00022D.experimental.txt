2.1.Preparation of spinning formulations
The PEDOT:PSS aqueous dispersion (Heraeus Clevios™ PH1000, PEDOT to PSS ratio of 1 : 2.5, concentration of ∼1.3 wt%, and mean particle size of 30 nm) was used as the main material for spinning. The spinning formulations were prepared with PEDOT:PSS concentrations ranging from 0.15 to 2.5 wt%. A homogeneous and aggregate-free dispersion of 2.5 wt% PEDOT:PSS was prepared by concentrating the original 1.3 wt% PEDOT:PSS dispersion using a vacuum rotary evaporator at 60 °C. Dispersions with concentration below 1.3 wt% were prepared by diluting the pristine PEDOT:PSS dispersion. For P2 and P4 fibers, the formulation was prepared by mixing 0.3 g of ethylene glycol (EG) with 10 mL of spinning formulation (2.5 wt%). All dispersions were bath sonicated (Branson B5500R-DTH, 40 kHz, 70 W) for 1 h to remove the bubbles prior to fiber spinning.
2.2.Wet-spinning of PEDOT:PSS fibers
Fibers were fabricated at room temperature using a custom-made bottom-up wet-spinning apparatus (Fig. 1a). Typically, the spinning formulation was loaded into a 3 mL syringe and then mounted on a syringe pump (KDS 100 Legacy). The formulation was extruded into H2SO4 coagulation bath through a blunt needle from the bottom of the coagulation bath using spinning flow rates of 1.5 to 3 mL h−1. The fiber was passed through a washing bath of ethanol/water mixture (volume ratio 3 : 1) to remove H2SO4 from fiber. PEDOT:PSS fibers were dried under tension at ∼60 °C using a 250 W halogen light as heating source. The light was placed ∼15 cm away from the fiber to avoid overheating the fiber, and collected by winding onto a spool. In this process, a 27 gauge needle (inner diameter 210 μm) was used to produce the P1 and P3 fibers, and a 32 gauge needle (inner diameter 110 μm) was used to produce P2 and P4 fibers. Multifilament PEDOT:PSS fibers were produced using the same method by replacing the single needle with a 7-hole spinneret (27 gauge) and using a spinning flow rate of 14 mL h−1. The PEDOT:PSS fiber fabricated in IPA coagulation bath was prepared following the literature reported method.27

2.3.Characterizations
The solidification process of PEDOT:PSS solution was monitored under a polarizing optical microscope (POM, OLYMPUS BX51). To study the phase separation, ∼100 μL of PEDOT:PSS dispersion (1.3 wt%) was injected into ∼5 mL H2SO4 solutions with different concentrations and the clear solutions were collected by filtration using glass fiber filter papers for further analysis. The UV-Vis spectra of the coagulation baths after spinning were recorded on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Cary 300, Agilent Technologies).
A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Supra 55VP) was used to study the morphology of the samples. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired on a Kratos AXIS Nova instrument equipped with a monochromated Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV) operating at 150 W at a step of 100 meV and dwell time of 250 ms. The SAXS/WAXS (small/wide-angle X-ray scattering) data of the PEDOT:PSS fibers was collected on the SAXS/WAXS beamline at the Australian Synchrotron (Melbourne, Australia), using 15 keV beam energy (wavelength 0.826 Å) and a Dectris-Pilatus 1M (169 × 179 mm; 981 × 1043 pixels) as the detector. The sample-detector distance was 281.1 mm. The data were integrated along the meridional and equatorial directions in the ±5° region using XMAS (X-ray Microdiffraction Analysis Software) to identify the anisotropic scattering. Calculation of the crystalline size and Herman's orientation function was discussed in ESI. Raman spectroscopy was performed using Renishaw InVia Raman Microspectrometer equipped with an Ar ion laser with 514 nm excitation wavelength at 5% laser power. The mechanical properties of the fibers were measured using a universal tensile testing system (Instron 30 kN Tensile Tester) with a 5 N load cell. Fiber samples were fixed between the grips with the aperture size of 5 mm and stress and strain data were recorded at the extension rate of 0.5 mm min−1. The electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS fiber was measured using a source meter unit (Keysight B2901A) by the aid of a custom-built four-point probe set-up.
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the fibers were obtained using a two-electrode configuration. Two PEDOT:PSS fibers were placed in parallel on a PET foil and coated with PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte. The gel electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 10 g of PVA and 10 g of H3PO4 in 100 mL of deionized water. Then device were died in air for 12 h before testing. The reserved electrode heads were connected to metal wires by silver paste for the electrochemical tests using an electrochemical workstation (BioLogic SP-300). The CV curves were recorded at a potential window of 0 to 1.0 V at scan rates ranging from 5 to 2000 mV s−1. The cyclic stability test was performed at 500 mV s−1 for 10 000 cycles.
For capacitive sensing, a capacitance (Cf) is formed between finger and electrode. The processor (Arduino uno R3) was used to recognize the change in capacitance. The humidity sensing experiment was performed using a custom-built humidity control system. The resistance of the fiber was recorded using a digital multimeter (Keysight 34461A) using a four-point probe set-up. All data were collected at room temperature.
