Conclusions
We have investigated the phase formation processes of Ln6−xMoO12−δ (Ln = La, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu; x = 0, 0.5) rare-earth molybdates in the range 900–1600 °C. The materials have been synthesized via mechanical activation of oxide mixtures, which ensured the formation of molybdates even during milling. Our data on low-temperature phase formation and crystallization processes in the range 900–1100 °C demonstrate the formation of a metastable fluorite, bixbyite, and tetragonal or rhombohedral phase, depending on the Ln ionic radius.
High-temperature synthesis in the range 1400–1600 °C allowed us to detect for the first time thermodynamic order–disorder (rhombohedral (R3̄)–bixbyite (Ia3̄)) phase transitions in the heavy rare-earth molybdates Ln6−xMoO12−δ (Ln = Er, Tm, Yb; x = 0, 0.5). The stability range of the rhombohedral phase increases with decreasing Ln ionic radius.
The total conductivity of La5.5MoO11.2 and two Yb6MoO12 polymorphs, with rhombohedral (R3̄) and bixbyite (Ia3̄) structures, has been determined in dry and wet air using impedance spectroscopy. Below 600 °C, the conductivity of La5.5MoO11.25 and bixbyite Yb6MoO12−δ (Ia3̄) has a significant proton contribution. Rhombohedral (R3̄) Yb6MoO12 has oxygen ion conductivity under these conditions (T &lt; 550 °C). At 600 °C in wet air, the conductivity of undoped La5.5MoO11.25, which has a complex structure derived from the rhombohedral one, is 2 × 10−4 S cm−1. The conductivity of rhombohedral (R3̄) Yb6MoO12 in air at 600 °C is 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 and that of bixbyite Yb6MoO12−δ at 600 °C is 1 × 10−5 S cm−1. So we have obtained and investigated the first members of oxygen ion- and/or proton-conducting materials with the bixbyite (Ia3̄) and rhombohedral (R3̄) structure in the family of Ln6−xMoO12−δ (Ln = Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu; x = 0, 0.5) molybdates.
