5.Conclusions
In summary, we have compared the performance of different PSF-based APEs to evaluate how the patterns of their microphase-separated morphologies influence their materials behavior. Conventional QAPSF (IEC = 1.02 mmol g−1) showed no obvious microphase separation and exhibited poor conductivity and high swelling. When introducing additional alkyl side chains into the QAPSF system by two different means, two kinds of APE materials (aQAPSF and pQAPSF) were realized, which show distinctly different patterns of phase-separated morphology. In aQAPSF, the aggregated hydrophilic species form broad and well-connected channels, significantly enhancing the ion conductive efficiency of the material and thus ensuring high ionic conductivity (0.1 S cm−1 at 80 °C) even when the IEC was as low as 0.98 mmol g−1. In contrast in pQAPSF, the aggregated but relatively isolated hydrophilic domains cannot guarantee the efficient transport of hydroxide ions, but its strong hydrophobic networks make it possible for such an APE to achieve good conductive performance by increasing the IEC. The conductivity of pQAPSF with an IEC of 2.04 mmol g−1 is 75.1 mS cm−1 at 80 °C with a swelling degree of 25.0%. Furthermore, aQAPSF and pQAPSF films exhibited much higher alkaline stability compared to the QAPSF membrane. High conductivities persisted in aQAPSF (IEC = 0.98 mmol g−1) and pQAPSF (IEC = 2.04 mmol g−1) after 30 days of stability testing in 1 M NaOH solution at 80 °C. Higher conductivity and good anti-swelling performance as well as greater chemical stability of APEs promise better performance characteristics of alkaline fuel cells. The peak power densities of APEFCs based on QAPSF (IEC = 1.02 mmol g−1), aQAPSF (IEC = 0.98 mmol g−1), and pQAPSF (IEC = 2.04 mmol g−1) were 0.11, 0.61, and 0.36 W cm−2, respectively, at 60 °C.
