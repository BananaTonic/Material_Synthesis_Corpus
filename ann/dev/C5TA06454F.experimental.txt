2.2Synthesis of perfluoroalkylene monomers
A 100 mL three-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet was charged with perfluoro-1,6-diiodohexane (5.54 g, 10.0 mmol), 1-chloro-3-iodobenzene (11.9 g, 50.0 mmol), Cu powder (9.53 g, 150 mmol) and DMSO (60 mL). The mixture was heated at 120 °C for 48 h. After the reaction, the mixture was poured into 300 mL of 0.1 M nitric acid to precipitate a gray powder. The crude product was collected by filtration and dissolved in 300 mL of methanol. The solution was filtered with a PTFE membrane filter (0.45 μm pore size, omnipore). The gray solid was washed several times with methanol. Into the combined filtrate, 500 mL of deionized water was poured slowly to precipitate a white crystalline powder. The product was washed with a 1/1 (by volume) mixture of methanol and water several times and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven to obtain pure perfluoroalkylene monomer 1 (x = 6) in 85% yield. The shorter chain length perfluoroalkylene monomer 1 (x = 4) was prepared in a similar manner from perfluoro-1,4-diiodobutane (30% yield).
2.3Polymerization
A typical procedure is as follows. A 100 mL three-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet and a mechanical stirrer was charged with the monomer 1 (x = 6) (5.42 g, 10.4 mmol), 1,3-dichlorobenzene (0.73 g, 4.99 mmol), 1,4-dichlorobenzene (0.95 g, 6.44 mmol), 2,2′-bipyridine (8.52 g, 54.5 mmol) and DMAc (55 mL). The mixture was heated at 80 °C to obtain a homogeneous solution. To this mixture, Ni(COD)2 (15.0 g, 54.5 mmol) was added. After polymerization for 3 h, the mixture was poured into 300 mL of methanol to precipitate a black powder. The crude product was treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid overnight, washed with water and methanol several times, and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven to obtain a white powdery product (PAF(C6)-2 (m1.00 n0.48 o0.62)) in 82% yield.
2.4Chloromethylation of PAF(C6)-2
A typical procedure is as follows. A 100 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser was charged with PAF(C6)-2 (m1.00 n0.48 o0.62) (4.20 g) and TCE (43 mL). After dissolution of the polymer, CMME (87 mL, 125 equimolar to phenylene unit in the hydrophilic moieties of the polymer), SOCl2 (13 mL, 20 equimolar to the phenylene unit in the hydrophilic moieties of the polymer), and ZnCl2 (1.18 g, equimolar to the phenylene unit in the hydrophilic moieties of the polymer) were added into the mixture. The mixture was heated at 80 °C for 24 h and poured into 800 mL of methanol to precipitate a white powder. The crude product was washed with methanol several times and dried at 60 °C in a vacuum oven to obtain a chloromethylated polymer (CMPAF(C6)-2 (m1.00 n0.48 o0.62)) in 97% yield.
2.5Quaternization of CMPAF(C6)-2
CMPAF(C6)-2 (m1.00 n0.48 o0.62) (2.00 g) was dissolved in 60 mL of 45 wt% trimethylamine aqueous solution. The mixture was stirred for 48 h at room temperature. Then, the mixture was poured into 240 mL of 2 M HCl to neutralize the excess trimethylamine. The mixture was dialyzed and evaporated to dryness to obtain a brown solid (QPAF(C6)-2 (m1.00 n0.48 o0.62)) in 98% yield.
2.6Membrane preparation
QPAF(C6)-2 (2.00 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of DMSO. The solution was filtered with a syringe stuffed with cotton and cast onto a flat glass plate. Drying the solution at 80 °C overnight gave a transparent light brown membrane (ca. 50 μm thick).
2.7Measurements
1H-NMR spectra were obtained on a JEOL JNM-ECA/ECX500 using deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) or deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as a solvent and 0.03% tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference. The molecular weight was measured with a gel permeation chromatograph (GPC) equipped with two Shodex K-805 L columns and a Jasco 805 UV detector (270 nm) with DMF containing 0.01 M LiBr as an eluent. The molecular weight was calibrated with standard polystyrene samples. For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation, a piece of the membrane was stained with tetrachloroplatinate ions by ion exchange of the ammonium groups in 0.5 M K2PtCl4 aqueous solution at 60 °C, and dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 60 °C. The stained membrane sample was embedded in epoxy resin, sectioned to 50 nm thickness with a Leica microtome Ultracut UCT, and placed on copper grids. Images were taken on a Hitachi H-9500 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
Ion exchange capacity (IEC) was determined by titration. The membrane samples (ca. 50 mg) in chloride ion forms were immersed in 12.5 mL of 0.1 M NaNO3 for 24 h. The amount of Cl− released from the membranes was measured by titration with 0.01 M AgNO3 using K2CrO4 as an indicator and NaHCO3 as a pH adjuster. The hydroxide ion conductivities of the membranes were measured in degassed, deionized water (18 MΩ) at 30, 40, 60, and 80 °C using a 4-probe conductivity cell attached with an AC impedance spectroscope (Solartron 1255B, Solartron Inc.). Ion conducting resistances (R (Ω)) were determined from the impedance plots obtained in the frequency range from 1 to 105 Hz. The hydroxide ion conductivity (σ) was calculated from the equation, σ = l/AR, where A (cm2) and l (cm) are the cross-sectional area of the membrane and the distance between two reference electrodes, respectively. Water uptake was measured in deionized water at room temperature for 24 h. Drying the membranes in a vacuum oven at 80 °C provided a dry weight (Wd). The wet weight (Ww) was measured after the surface water was carefully wiped off with paper. The water uptake was calculated using the following equation: water uptake (%) = (Ww − Wd)/Wd × 100. The ion conductivity and water uptake of the membranes in chloride ion form were measured under N2 with controlled humidity with a Bel Japan solid electrolyte analyzer system MSB-AD-V-FC equipped with a chamber, a magnetic suspension balance, and a 4-probe conductivity cell. The chloride ion conductivities were measured after equilibrating for at least 1 h at set temperature and humidity by using an AC impedance spectroscope (Solartron 1255B, Solartron Inc.). For water uptake measurements, membrane samples were set in a chamber and dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 3 h to obtain the dry weight, and the wet weight was collected after equilibrating for at least 1 h at set temperature and humidity.
The alkaline stability test of the membranes was performed in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at 60 and 80 °C. The hydroxide ion conductivity was recorded in degassed water at 40 °C as a function of testing time. The post-test membranes were analyzed by using IR spectra.
Gas permeability was measured using a GTR-Tech 20XFYC gas permeation measurement apparatus containing a Yanaco G2700T gas chromatograph with a Porapak-Q column and a TCD detector. Argon and helium were used as the carrier gas for the measurement of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively. A membrane sample in chloride ion form (40 mm in diameter and 50 μm thick) was set in a cell that had a gas inlet and an outlet on both sides of the membrane. On one side of the membrane, hydrogen or oxygen test gas was supplied at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1, while on the other side of the membrane, the same gas used as the carrier in the gas chromatograph (flow gas) was supplied at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 and gases on both sides were dried or humidified under the same conditions to ensure homogeneous wetting of the membrane sample. Then, 7.4 mL of flow gas was sampled and subjected to gas chromatography to quantify the test gas permeated through the membrane. The measurement was repeated until stable permeation data were obtained at least for 5 h. The gas permeation coefficient, Q (cm3 (STD) cm cm−2 s−1 cmHg−1) was calculated by the following equation: Q = 273/T × 1/A × B × 1/t × 1/(76-PH2O), where T (K) is the absolute temperature of the cell, A (cm2) is the permeation area, B (cm3) is the amount of permeated test gas, t (s) is the sampling time, l (cm) is the thickness of the membrane and PH2O (cmHg) is the water vapor pressure.
Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was carried out with an ITK DVA-225 dynamic viscoelastic analyzer. Temperature dependence of storage modulus (E′(Pa)), loss modulus (E′′(Pa)), and tan δ at 60% RH and 10 Hz was obtained for the membranes (5 × 30 mm) between r.t. and 95 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1.
Tensile strength testing was carried out with a Shimadzu universal testing instrument Autograph AGS-J500N equipped with a temperature and humidity controllable chamber. The samples were cut into a dumbbell shape (35 × 6 mm (total) and 12 × 2 mm (test area)). Stress strain curves were obtained at 80 °C and 60% RH at a stretching rate of 10 mm min−1 after equilibrating the membrane at least for 3 h.
2.8Preparation of the catalyst coated membrane (CCM) and fuel cell operation
Pt (50 wt%) catalysts supported on carbon black (0.80 g) (TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo), water (3.30 g), and ethanol (3.30 g) were mixed by using a planetary ball mill at 270 rpm for 30 min. After adding 5 wt% QPAF(C6)-2 solution in ethanol (6.80 g), the mixture was further mixed by using a ball mill for 30 min at 270 rpm and by using a pot mill for 12 h. The mass ratio of the dried ionomer and carbon black was adjusted to be 0.8. The slurry thus obtained was sprayed onto both sides of the QPAF(C6)-2 or QPAF(C6)-4 membrane (54 μm thick) and pressed at 10 kgf cm−2 at r.t. for 3 min to obtain a catalyst coated membrane (CCM). The coated area was 4.4 cm2. The Pt loading in the catalyst layer was ca. 0.20 mg cm−2 for each electrode. The CCM was treated with 1.0 M KOH for 48 h for ion exchange and with deionized water for 24 h to remove residual KOH. The treated CCM was mounted on a single cell with a gas diffusion layer and a gasket. Prior to the measurements, fully humidified hydrogen and nitrogen were supplied to the anode and cathode, respectively. The fuel cell was operated at 40 °C or 60 °C by supplying full humidified H2 and O2 gas at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 to the anode and the cathode, respectively. The high-frequency resistance (HFR) of the cell was measured with a Kikusui FC impedance meter 2150 at 5.0 kHz.
