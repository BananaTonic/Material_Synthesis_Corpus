Conclusions
In summary, we developed a new checkerboard-like structure design to achieve the individual dispersion of NiCo2O4 NPs in C/CNT hybrid nanosheets at a high mass loading of 85.1%. In the nanosheets, CNTs and cellulose-derived carbon act as a high-speed conductive network and loading substrate, respectively, and show excellent electrical contacts and a stable structure between them. We showed that the nanosheet possesses a stable 2D, 1D and 0D ternary hybrid structure and can assemble into electrodes without binders or other additives. The assembled electrode shows an excellent conductivity of 175.9 S cm−1 even at a high NiCo2O4 loading of 85.1%, enabling us to achieve a high mass loading of 12.8 mg cm−2 with a high density of 2.5 g cm−3. The resultant binder-free anode has a high capacity, superior rate performance and long life, even at a high current density and a high mass loading. This strategy opens up a new way to increase the content, conductivity, stability and utilization of nanoscale TMOs in electrodes by constructing a checkerboard-like hybrid structure and may have higher application potential in other fields, such as water splitting, water purification, and air batteries.
