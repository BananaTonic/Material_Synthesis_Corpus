2.3.Synthesis of the gel electrolytes
The conductive gel electrolytes were prepared by the radical polymerization of IMMA (TFSI or FSI), or PYRMA (TFSI or FSI), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and LiTFSI, with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMMA) as the cross-linking agent (1 wt%), Irgacure 651 (1 wt%) as the photo-initiator, and EMIFSI, EMITFSI or PMPFSI as liquid electrolyte. The homogenous solution comprising all comonomers and the photoinitiator were transferred into a glass vial, degassed by nitrogen bubbling and ultrasonicated for 10 min. After that, 825 μL of comonomer solution was injected into an oxygen-free atmosphere in a circular teflon mould of 2.5 cm diameter. In this mould, the photoinitiated bulk polymerization was performed by irradiation with UV light (365 nm) at RT for 55 minutes. Then, the gel electrolyte was demoulded and conditioned at RT. IGPs of ≈1300 μm thick were obtained. The chemical structures of formulation components are depicted in Scheme 1. The composition and nomenclature of the synthesized IGPs are shown in Table 1.

For all the electrolytes, basic characterization has been done, including structural characterization of the monomers by NMR and of the IGPs by FTIR and Raman microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermal stability and rheology. Details on this are given in Section S2 of ESI, Table S1 (thermal stability), Fig. S6 and Table S2 (rheology), Fig. S8 (XRD) and Fig. S9 (confocal Raman microscopy). The IGPs prepared can be easily handled as shown in the movie attached in the ESI. The study of the bulk of the electrolytes by optical and electron microscopy and by Raman microscopy (Fig. S9a) has revealed highly homogeneous materials with a liquid-like soft appearance and no evidence of poor mixing or poor dissolution of the Li salt.
2.4.1Viscosity and density
The viscosity (η) of the liquid phase in each electrolyte has been determined at 25 °C using an Anton Paar SVM 3000. These liquid phases have been prepared so as to mimic as far as possible the mobile phase in the gel electrolytes, and they have the same composition as their solid electrolyte analogues except for the polymer scaffold. The viscosity of the liquid phases and their composition are shown in Table 2.

All angle X-ray scattering measurements were performed using a D8 Advance Bruker instrument (Cu-Anode, Kα, Cu). Measurements were conducted at an intensity of 40 mA and voltage of 40 kV. Diffractograms were performed over the angular range of 2θ = 2–60°, with an accumulation time of 0.5 s at each increment of 0.5°. At least three measurements were taken on each sample.
2.4.3Confocal Raman spectroscopy
Measurements were done in a Renishaw InVia Reflex Raman system with an optical microscope coupled to the system. The Raman scattering is excited using a diode laser at a wavelength of 785 nm. The laser beam is focused on the sample with a 50× microscope objective which provides a spot size of ≈1 μm. The laser power at the sample, exposure time and number of accumulations for the Raman measurements correspond to 160 mW, 10 seconds and 1, respectively. The spectral range is 200–1800 cm−1. The mapping areas of 10 × 10 and 20 × 20 μm have been studied, by collecting one spectrum for every micron in the range of 700–1400 cm−1.
2.4.4ATR-FTIR
ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded on the surface of the electrolytes using a FTIR Perkin Elmer Spectrum-One, with 10 scans and 2 cm−1 resolution.
2.4.5PGSE-NMR
7Li and 19F PGSE-NMR measurements
The NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker Avance™ 400 spectrometer equipped with a 89 mm wide bore and 9.4 T superconducting magnet (Larmor frequencies of 7Li and 19F at 155.51 and 376.51 MHz, respectively). The 7Li and 19F diffusion reported data were acquired at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C with a Bruker diffusion probe head, Diff60, using 90° radiofrequency (rf) pulse lengths of 11.0 μs.
In the diffusion experiments, a pulsed field gradient stimulated spin echo pulse sequence was used.19 The time between the first two 90° rf pulses (the echo time), τ1, was 3.5 ms, and the self-diffusion coefficients of 7Li and 19F, D(Li) and D(TFSI) or D(FSI), respectively, were measured by varying the amplitude of the gradient pulse from 0 to up to 1800 G cm−1. The diffusion time, Δ, and length of the gradient pulses were 80 and 2 ms, respectively. The repetition rate was always five times the spin-lattice relaxation time, T1, of the nuclei being observed. The total acquisition time for these experiments varied from 10 min to 2 h. The decay of the echo amplitude was monitored typically to at least 50% of its initial value, and the apparent diffusion coefficient was calculated by fitting a mono-exponential function to the decay curve. Previously, the magnetic field gradient was calibrated as described elsewhere.9
2.4.6Conductivity measurements
The conductivity of the electrolytes was determined in a NOVOCONTROL GmbH Concept 40 broadband dielectric spectrometer in the temperature range from −50 °C to 90 °C and in the frequency range between 1 and 107 Hz. Disk films of dimensions of 2.5 cm diameter and ∼1300 μm thickness were inserted between two gold-plated flat electrodes, and the samples are cooled to −50 °C. Then, a frequency sweep is done for every 10 °C heating from −50 to 90 °C; thereafter the same measurements are done but while cooling from 90 to 25 °C (Fig. S7). The ionic conductivity (σ) reported in this work corresponds to the second cooling σ measurements.
2.5.Methodology and nomenclature
To prepare the IGPs in Table 1 four different PILs, IMMATFSI, PYRMATFSI, IMMAFSI and PYRMAFSI, and a neutral monomer MMA have been used. The liquid electrolytes consisted of EMIFSI, PMPFSI and EMITFSI doped with LiTFSI. Starting from the IGP named PIMTFSI/Li/EMIFSI, described in our previous work,17 new IGPs have been prepared, by varying (i) the nature of the cation in the polymer chain (IMMATFSI or IMMAFSI and PYRMATFSI or PYRMAFSI), (ii) the molar fraction of the polycation in the polymer chain (by introducing varying amounts of MMA), (iii) the cation in the liquid electrolyte phase (EMI or PMP), (iv) the anion in the liquid electrolyte phase (by varying the counteranion of the ionic liquid and of the polycation) (TFSI and FSI) and (v) the concentration of Li in the liquid electrolyte phase. The number of experimental variables is high and for an efficient study of the same, the methodology summarized in Scheme 2 has been followed, where 4 main sets of polymers are proposed:
Methodology followed for the preparation of the samples.
• To check the effect of a neutral monomer in the chain on substitution of either IMMA and PYRMA polyelectrolytes, a series with increasing MMA in the chain and the same liquid electrolyte, beginning with PIMTFSI-MMA0.34/Li, where a fraction of the IMMA units in the chain were substituted by MMA, χMMA = 0.34. This fraction was higher in PIMTFSI-MMA0.61/Li/EMIFSI (χMMA = 0.61), and finally a pure PMMA (χMMA = 1) was used to prepare PMMA/Li/EMIFSI.
• To check the effect of the nature of the polycation, the following pairs of electrolytes have been prepared which are similar except for the polycation: PIMTFSI/Li/EMITFSI and PYRTFSI/Li/EMITFSI (EMITFSI/LiTFSI as the liquid electrolyte) and PIMTFSI/Li/EMIFSI and PYRTFSI/Li/EMIFSI PIMFSI/Li/EMIFSI and PYRFSI/Li/EMIFSI (EMIFSI/LiTFSI as the liquid electrolyte). To check the effect of the polycation counteranion, the following pairs can be compared, which are similar except for the counteranion: PIMTFSI/Li/EMIFSI, PIMFSI/Li/EMIFSI, PYRTFSI/Li/EMIFSI and PYRFSI/Li/EMIFSI.
• To check the effect of the liquid electrolyte viscosity on both IMMA and PYRMA polyelectrolytes, two series have been prepared. The first one with polyelectrolyte PIMMATFSI and three ionic liquid phases: PIMTFSI/Li/EMIFSI, PIMTFSI/Li/PMPFSI, and PIMTFSI/Li/EMITFSI. The second one is prepared with the PYRMATFSI polycation and the same three liquid phases: PYRTFSI/Li/EMIFSI, PYRTFSI/Li/PMPFSI, and PYRTFSI/Li/EMITFSI.
• Anion-exchange transport occurs only over a given [Li] threshold. To check the effect of [Li], two series were prepared using PIMFSI based electrolytes with decreasing [Li] (appearing as a subscript in the name of the electrolyte): PIMFSI/Li1.2/EMIFSI, PIMFSI/Li/EMIFSI, PIMFSI/Li0.8/EMIFSI and PIMFSI/Li0.6/EMIFSI. Also using PIMTFSI, PIMTFSI/Li/EMIFSI and PIMTFSI/Li0.86/EMIFSI were prepared.
The structural relationship among the electrolytes is summarized in Scheme 2.
This methodology attempts to identify the structural features which enhance anion exchange transport the most, and to do so it is important to understand at the same time the extent of viscous effects affecting conventional diffusivity (eqn (1)). For instance, when changing the liquid phase from EMIFSI/LiTFSI to PMPFSI/LiTFSI and finally to EMITFSI/LiTFSI a progressive increase in viscosity should be expected, as shown in Table 2. This should decrease the diffusivity of the anions and of Li (for according to other authors14 and to our previous experience17 Li is transported both by Stokes–Einstein and anion exchange diffusion mechanisms). Special attention should be paid to changes in the [Li], for opposing effects are expected: on one hand addition of the Li salt is known to increase the viscosity of ionic liquids (see Table 2) (decreasing the diffusivity of all ions consequently) but on the other hand it has been proposed that the anion exchange mechanism occurs at high [Li], and therefore higher [Li] could increase Li diffusivity.
