Conclusions
The conductivity and hydrogen permeability of BCZY27/STN95 (BS27) composite cercer compositions of 50, 60, and 70 volume% STN95 were measured. The total conductivity for BS27 is significantly lower than the prediction given by standard effective medium theories for composite electrical properties. Thus, a modified effective medium model explicitly accounting for interfacial effects between the two phases was developed. This interfacial effective medium (IEM) model more accurately described the response of BS27, but does not fully describe the electrical properties at high STN95 volume fractions (&gt;60%). Calculations of interfacial conductivities based on space charge layer theory are consistent with the value of the interfacial resistance obtained from the IEM calculations. Hydrogen flux was observed only for BS27_5050 samples, indicating that boosting the total conductivity by adding more STN95 chokes off the proton-conducting BCZY27 phase. The performance of BS27_5050 in pure permeation mode (without catalysts or electrodes) was 0.004–0.008 μmol cm−2 s−1 from 600–800 °C, and is comparable to some single-phase and cercer ceramic membrane materials, while falling short of many cermets and at least one new cercer membrane. The deposition of thin palladium layers (100 nm) to a BS27_5050 sample by sputtering improved the measured flux at 700 °C by a factor of 4.5 to a maximum of 0.026 μmol cm−2 s−1. Overall, there are a number of challenges to optimizing BS27 as a competitive hydrogen separation material.
