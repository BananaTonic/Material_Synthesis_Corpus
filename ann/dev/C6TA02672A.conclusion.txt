4.Conclusions
(i) Single-phase Sr0.8Ln0.2V1−yNbyO3−δ (Ln = La or Y, y = 0–0.10) ceramics with cubic perovskite structure were synthesized by a solid-state route under reducing conditions at 1500 °C in 10% H2–N2 atmosphere;
(ii) Sr0.8Ln0.2V1−yNbyO3−δ ceramics exhibit metallic-like electrical conductivity. The conductivity is nearly p(O2)-independent in the oxygen partial pressure range studied and decreases with donor-type substitutions. For the studied compositional range, electrical conductivity exceeds 100 S cm−1 at temperatures ≤950 °C being sufficiently high for SOFC electrode applications;
(iii) Partial substitutions of strontium by rare-earth metal cations expand the phase stability domain to more oxidizing conditions. At 900 °C, the upper-p(O2) stability boundary was found to shift from ∼10−15 atm for the parent strontium vanadate to ∼6 × 10−13 atm for Sr0.8Y0.2VO3−δ, whereas oxidative decomposition of Sr0.8La0.2VO3−δ occurs in the p(O2) range between 10−10 and 10−5 atm.
(iv) Co-substitution by niobium in vanadium sublattice has rather minor (Y-containing series) or even negative (La-containing series) effect on the perovskite phase stability boundary, but results in slower kinetics of oxidative decomposition to V5+-based phases under an inert atmosphere;
(v) Sluggish oxidation kinetics under inert gas environment, demonstrated by electrical, thermogravimetric and dilatometric studies, results in almost reversible behavior of substituted vanadates after exposure to an inert atmosphere (T ≤ 1200 °C), enabling the fabrication SrVO3−δ-based anodes of solid electrolyte cells under these conditions;
(vi) An additional benefit of donor-type substitution is suppressed chemical expansion on thermocycling and better thermomechanical compatibility of Sr0.8Ln0.2V1−yNbyO3−δ ceramic electrodes with solid electrolytes.
