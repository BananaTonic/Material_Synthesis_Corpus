4.Conclusion
In conclusion, a novel completely freestanding solid polymer electrolyte film of LiPEOP 4 based on PEO, PDMS and LiClO4 is developed having high Li+ ionic conductivity of ∼0.03 mS cm−1 and high Li-ion transport number (0.69). LiPEOP 4 is found to be mechanically robust (Young's modulus ∼0.98 MPa), hydrophobic (WCA &gt; 100°), transparent in the visible range (85%), and simple to process. It is also found that large area thickness controlled films can be developed using techniques such as a doctor's blade thin film applicator technique. The addition of LiClO4 in ethanol to PEO–PDMS polymer matrix introduced the salting in effect due to the ion–dipole interactions initiated by ClO4− anions, leading to the amorphization of the PEO structure. This augments the Li-ion transference through the polymer membrane leading to a high ionic conductivity. Further, a transparent flexible capacitor is developed using this TSE, and its capacitance is found to be ∼1 F g−1. Rechargeable Li-ion half-cells are also constructed without the aid of liquid electrolyte interfaces and the energy density is found to be close to 55 mA h g−1. The energy density values do not reach the theoretical specific capacity (170 mA h g−1),48 but it is to be noted that these cells are developed without much focus on the electrode–electrolyte interface engineering for making low impedance interfaces, and this can be addressed using state of the art electrode development tools and post heat treatments. Nevertheless, this demonstration of a simple, completely transparent, flexible, hydrophobic, solid polymer electrolyte of high ion conductivity can open new avenues in the development of solid state batteries which are more environmentally benign and safer in any extreme environments.
