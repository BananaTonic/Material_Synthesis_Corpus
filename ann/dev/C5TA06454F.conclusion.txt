4.Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized ammonium functionalized copolymers (QPAFs) composed of perfluoroalkylene and phenylene main chains without heteroatom linkages. The polymerization, chloromethylation, and quaternization reactions were quantitative to provide high molecular weight copolymers with a controllable IEC value. QPAFs thus obtained were soluble in a variety of polar organic solvents such as methanol, DMF, and DMSO, and provided bendable membranes by solution casting. Because of the significant hydrophilic/hydrophobic differences in the main chain between the perfluoroalkyl and the quaternized phenylene groups, the random copolymers exhibited a distinct phase-separated morphology as suggested by TEM images. The QPAF membranes exhibited a volcano type dependence of the hydroxide ion conductivity on the IEC, and balanced conductivity and water uptake properties were obtained for the QPAF membrane with IEC = 1.26 meq g−1. Because of the lack of heteroatom linkages in the main chains, QPAF membranes showed reasonable stability in water and alkaline solution at 80 °C. However, the benzyl trimethylammonium groups were decomposed in hot 1 M KOH resulting in a decrease in the conductivity within several hundred hours. QPAF and Nafion membranes, both containing perfluorinated alkylene groups in the main chain, exhibited similar mechanical properties, while the QPAF membrane showed much lower gas permeability presumably because of the rigid phenylene units attached to the ammonium groups. A fuel cell using the QPAF as the membrane and electrode binder was successfully operated with humidified hydrogen and oxygen (no back pressure). The maximum power density obtained was 139 mW cm−2 at a current density of 420 mA cm−2, proving that the QPAF functioned well in an operating fuel cell.
