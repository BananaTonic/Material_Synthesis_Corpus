Conclusions
A sulfide-based superionic conductor, Li6PS5Br, was synthesized via a liquid-phase technique employing a homogeneous tetrahydrofuran and ethanol-based solution. Synthesis of the Li6PS5Br solid electrolyte using tetrahydrofuran and ethanol offers the advantages of a shorter reaction time compared with that of the solid-phase method. Of all the SEs prepared by liquid-phase techniques, the prepared Li6PS5Br shows the highest ionic conductivity of 3.1 mS cm−1 at 25 °C. In addition, a wide contact area between the NMC electrode and Li6PS5Br electrolyte was constructed by the coating technique employing the Li6PS5Br precursor solution. This process generated a favorable interface, resulting in a higher reversible capacity of 119 mA h g−1 relative to that of the cell with the conventional mixture electrode. In addition, infiltrating a porous electrode with the precursor solution of the solid electrolyte easily brought about homogeneous composite electrodes to improve cell performance. Moreover, the all-solid-state cell employing the fine Li6PS5Br powder with a higher conductivity of 1 mS cm−1 or more showed a reversible capacity of 150 mA h g−1. Thus, this technique is both effective for the preparation of solid electrolytes and applicable to all-solid-state batteries.
