Conclusions
Li6PS5Br with an ionic conductivity of 2.58 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature was obtained by annealing the precursors acquired from simple direct milling of the raw materials at a low rotation speed. Structural and conductivity analysis showed that in order to achieve Li6PS5Br with an ionic conductivity close to 1 mS cm−1 using this simple solid-state reaction route, the heat treatment temperature should be higher than 400 °C. Neutron diffraction results suggest three kinds of jumps in Li6PS5Br; the doublet jump, the inter-cage jump, and the intra-cage jumps, which directly correlate to the ionic conductivity and are influenced by the annealing temperatures. A high Li-ion conductivity can be achieved when the Br ordering over 4a and 4c sites ratio is close to 3. The capacity of the Li6PS5Br-based all-solid-state Li–S batteries arises from two separate contributions, which include the active materials and the solid electrolyte in the cathode mixture.
