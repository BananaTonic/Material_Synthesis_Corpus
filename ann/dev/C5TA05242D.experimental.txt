G2E (Alfa Aesar) was purified by distillation and further dried with 4 Å molecular sieves. MFE (TCI Co., Ltd.) and FEC (Zhangjiagang Guotai-Huarong Co., Ltd.) were used as received. 0.8 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Morita Chemical Industries Corporation Ltd.) was dissolved in the mixture of G2E/MFE/FEC (50 : 45 : 5 wt%) to obtain the new electrolyte for lithium ion batteries. 0.8 M LiTFSI–G2E and 0.8 M LiTFSI–G2E/MFE (50 : 50 wt%) electrolytes were also prepared in a similar way. The procedure was carried out in an argon-filled glovebox. The water content was detected by using a moisture titrator (Metrohm 73KF coulometer) based on the Karl-Fischer method, and the value was less than 30 ppm. A conventional electrolyte (Zhangjiagang Guotai-Huarong Co., Ltd.), 1 M LiPF6–ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/DEC (1 : 1 : 1 by weight ratio), was used as a reference. 5 wt% FEC was added to this commercial electrolyte as another reference.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments were performed to investigate the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. The working electrode was a glassy carbon disk (3 mm diameter), and lithium metal was used as both counter and reference electrodes. The glassy carbon electrode was polished with alumina paste (d = 0.1 μm). The polished electrode was washed with deionized water and dried under vacuum. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry experiments were conducted to study the electrochemical behavior of the Al current collector. A disk of Al foil (14 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode, and lithium metal was used as both counter and reference electrodes. The surface morphology of Al foil was also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, NOVA NanoSEM 230).
Viscosity was measured by using a viscometer (DV-III ULTRA, Brookfield Engineering Laboratories, Inc.), and conductivity was measured by using a DDS-11A conductivity meter. The wettability of the electrolyte to the separator and electrode was analyzed by using a contact angle apparatus (OCA20, Dataphysics). The Li+ transference number (tLi+) was evaluated by impedance combined with a dc polarization method using a lithium symmetric cell, as described in the literature studies.16–18 The flammability test was carried out according to the reported method.19,20 The flame of the lighter approached the surface of the electrolyte (1.0 g) for some time, as shown in Fig. 4. If the electrolyte did not ignite, the electrolyte was considered to be non-flammable. If the electrolyte ignited immediately and the electrolyte kept burning when the flame was removed, the electrolyte was flammable. If the electrolyte ignited immediately and the ignition of the electrolyte ceased when the flame was removed, this phenomenon was defined as “self-quench”. Each electrolyte was tested three times. The flash point was measured by using a close-cup flashpoint tester (Shanghai SUN Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd.) based on the standard of a ASTM D3828, and determined as an average of three consecutive tests.
A coin cell was used to evaluate the performances of electrolytes in lithium ion batteries. The commercial LiFePO4 cathode and graphite anode were obtained from Jiangsu Litian New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. The cathode was composed of 93 wt% LiFePO4, 3 wt% acetylene black (AB) and 4 wt% PVDF, coated onto Al foil. The loading of LiFePO4 was about 17.0 mg cm−2. The composition of the anode was 94 wt% graphite, 2 wt% AB, 2 wt% CarboxyMethylCellulose (CMC) and 2 wt% Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR), deposited onto Cu foil. The loading of graphite was about 9.0 mg cm−2. Li/graphite and graphite/LiFePO4 coin cells using a Celgard® 2320 as the separator were assembled in the glovebox. In order to ensure complete penetration of the electrolyte into the thick electrode sheet, the cell was kept at room temperature for 24 h before the test. A CT2001A cell test instrument was used to perform the charge–discharge (C–D) test of the graphite/LiFePO4 cell. The current rate was determined according to the theoretical capacity of the LiFePO4 cathode (170 mA h g−1). Charge had one process: constant current rate, cut-off voltage of 4.2 V, and discharge also had one process: constant current, cut-off voltage of 2.5 V.
The measurements of LSV, CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), chronoamperometry and dc polarization were conducted on a CHI660D electrochemistry workstation.
