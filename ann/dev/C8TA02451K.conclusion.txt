Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated microporous carbon nanomaterials using an intrinsically porous polymer (PIM-1 in this study) as a precursor and developed a facile strategy (NIPS process in this study) for creating hierarchically porous architectures for use in SC electrodes. Importantly, the concept of starting with intrinsically porous components was shown to be crucial for the design and SC performance of the resulting electrode. The hierarchically porous structure of the prepared materials featuring a three-dimensionally interconnected network resulted in exceptional surface areas, improved reaction kinetics (due to facilitated ion/electron transport), enabling a high specific capacitance, good rate capacity retention at high specific currents, and superior specific energy. We thus anticipate that the developed strategy for the fabrication of hierarchically microporous materials may open up a wide range of new opportunities, potentially, for advanced separation and energy technologies.
