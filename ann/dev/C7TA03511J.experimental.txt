Preparation of SC-WP
100 g of the shredded WP was soaked in 3 L of deionized water for 24 h and mechanically stirred for 3 h at 720 rpm to form homogeneous WP pulp. Then, 120 mL of the WP pulp was diluted to 400 mL with deionized water in a flask, and an appropriate amount of SC was dissolved in the pulp. The pulp was adjusted to pH 4.5 using acetic acid followed by oxidation at 80 °C for 2 h under mechanical stirring at 550 rpm. Finally, the SC-WP pulp was washed with deionized water until pH 6, then washed with anhydrous ethanol three times to remove the residual water and re-dispersed in 300 mL of ethanol.
Preparation of 3C aerogels
The SC-WP suspension in ethanol was homogenized at 10 000 rpm for 20 min. After that, the suspension (300 mL) was poured into a cylindraceous mould 23.5 mm in diameter, filtered to yield the SC-WP aerogels, and then dried in an oven at 60 °C for 6 h. Finally, the SC-WP aerogels were pyrolyzed in a tubular furnace at a certain temperature (200–1000 °C) for a period of time (1–8 h) in a N2 atmosphere to form the 3C aerogels. In order to remove the air trapped in the samples, the furnace was repeatedly evacuated and charged with N2 six times. The furnace was heated up to the preset temperature at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and held at the temperature for a period of time (1–8 h), and then cooled down naturally to room temperature.
