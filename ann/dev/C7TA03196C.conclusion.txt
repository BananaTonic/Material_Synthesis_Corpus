Conclusions
In conclusion, the first ionic thermoelectric paper has been demonstrated by making a composite from nanofibrillated cellulose and a polyelectrolyte. The introduction of nanofibers of cellulose led to a robust nanocomposite, not fragile nor brittle as was the pure polyelectrolyte. The thermoelectric properties of the paper composite were as good as the pure polyelectrolyte (ZTi = 0.025 at room temperature). The ionic conductivity of the composite was almost the same as that of pure PSSNa at high humidity and its Seebeck coefficient was higher than that of pure PSSNa. The fabrication of ionic thermoelectric paper opens up new possibilities in term of mass manufacturing of materials for large area ionic thermoelectric SCs. Those devices are designed to convert thermal energy from intermittent heat sources into stored electricity.
