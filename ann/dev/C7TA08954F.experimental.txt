2.1Sample preparation
Y1−xCaxBaCo2O5+δ powders (YCBC, x = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3, denoted as YCBC-0, YCBC-1, YCBC-2, and YCBC-3, respectively) were synthesized via a combined ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) and citric acid complexing method. Y(NO3)3, Ca(NO3)2, Ba(NO3)2 and Co(NO3)2·6H2O (AR, Sinopharm, China) served as raw materials for the necessary metal ions, while EDTA (AR, Guangdong Xilong, China) and citric acid monohydrate (AR, Guangdong Xilong, China) played the role of complexing agents. The molar ratio between the total amount of metal ions, EDTA and citric acid monohydrate was 1 : 1 : 1.5 and the pH was adjusted to 7 with ammonia (AR, Sinopharm, China). The mixed solution was dehydrated at 80 °C to form a gel, and then the gel was calcined at 250 °C for 2 h to achieve fluffy combustion powders. Subsequently, the precursors were ground and calcined at 400 °C for 2 h and at 800 °C for 6 h to remove organic residues. Finally, the powders were heat-treated at 1000 °C for 10 h in air to get the desired double perovskite phases. La0.4Ce0.6O2−δ (LDC) and Ce0.9Gd0.1O2−δ (GDC) powders were synthesized by using the same method. To get dense samples for electrical conductivity measurements, rectangular bars (40 mm × 7 mm × 3 mm) of each chemical composition were uniaxially pressed and sintered at 1050–1150 °C for 6 h in air.
2.2Cell fabrication
Dense La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3−δ (LSGM, http://fuelcellmaterials.com) pellets with a diameter of 13 mm were sintered at 1450 °C for 8 h and then polished to a thickness of 300 μm. Homogeneous electrode slurries were prepared by mixing the respective electrode powders with α-terpineol solution of 6 wt% ethylene cellulose, in a weight ratio of 2 : 1. For the fabrication of symmetric cells, Y1−xCaxBaCo2O5+δ (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2) slurries were symmetrically screen-printed on both sides of the LSGM electrolyte with an active area of 0.5 cm2. The electrodes were heat-treated at 1000 °C for 3 h. The electrochemical performance of the YCBC cathode was tested in an electrolyte-supported single cell. To prevent reaction at the anode/electrolyte interface and interdiffusion of ionic species, La0.4Ce0.6O2−δ (LDC) was employed as the buffer layer and calcined at 1400 °C for 2 h. SrFeMo0.65Ni0.35O6−δ (SFMN) double perovskite was used as the anode, and it was screen-printed onto the LDC layer and then sintered at 1150 °C for 2 h.40 The YCBC/GDC composite cathode (50 : 50 in wt%) was screen-printed on the electrolyte and calcined at 1000 °C for 3 h. The active area of the cathode was 0.5 cm2 with a thickness of about 40–50 μm. Ag paste was used as the current collector in the constructed cells, which was painted on and fired at 700 °C for 0.5 h. Then, the obtained cells were sealed on an alumina tube using a ceramic-based sealing material (Cerama-bond 552-VFG, Aremco, USA). Humidified H2 with a flow rate of 80 cm3 min−1 was fed as a fuel to the anode, and air was supplied to the cathode side at a flow rate of 100 cm3 min−1 as an oxidant.
2.3Characterization techniques
The phase purity and crystal structure of YCBC materials as well as their chemical compatibility with the LSGM electrolyte were characterized by an X-ray diffraction method at RT (XRD, Rigaku D/max-A, Cu-Kα radiation) with a step of 0.02 deg. Additionally, high-temperature XRD studies were also performed in air up to 900 °C on a Panalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with an Anton Paar 1200N oven-chamber and PIXcel3D detector over the 2θ range of 10–110 deg. Rietveld refinements of the XRD patterns were conducted using the GSAS/EXPGUI set of software.41,42 HT-XRD data also allowed the calculation of the thermal expansion coefficient for the considered YCBC materials. Thermogravimetric measurements (TG) were performed on a TA Instruments Q5000 IR thermobalance in synthetic air, with a flow rate of 100 cm3 min−1 in a temperature range of 30–900 °C with a heating/cooling rate of 2° min−1. The average oxidation states of Co and oxygen nonstoichiometry at room temperature were determined by iodometric titration analysis.43 The microstructure of dense sinters of YCBC and the morphology of porous cathode layers were observed by using a scanning electron microscopy technique (SEM, LEO-1450). The total electrical conductivity of YCBC was measured with a four-terminal DC method over a temperature range of 200–850 °C in air. The conductivity data were collected every 25 °C after equilibrium was achieved at each temperature. A Solartron 1260 impedance gain-phase analyzer combined with a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface was used to record the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and current–voltage (I–V) curves. The polarization resistances of the symmetric cells were measured under open circuit conditions in a frequency range from 106 to 0.1 Hz, with a signal amplitude of 10 mV. To measure single-cell performance, the I–V curves were recorded in the temperature range of 650–850 °C.
2.4Ab initio computations
Ab initio calculations were performed with Materials Studio software using the CASTEP code to estimate the oxygen vacancy formation energy as well as to calculate the density of states (DOS) of the considered YCBC. The GGA and PBE scheme was employed in this work. The plane-waves cut-off energy was set as 571.4 eV. The cell parameters and atomic coordinates of the simulated structures were optimized by using the BFGS algorithm. Tolerance for self-consistency was chosen as 1.0 × 10−5 eV per atom, 0.03 eV Å−1 for force, 0.05 GPa for maximum stress, and 0.001 Å for the maximum displacement. The structural model of the YCBC material was based on a tetragonal cell with 38 atoms (Y4Ba4Co8O22 and Y3CaBa4Co8O22) that corresponds to a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of YBaCo2O5.5, see Fig. S1.
