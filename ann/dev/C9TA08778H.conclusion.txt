Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed a novel class of nanowire-film-reinforced hybrid gel polymer electrolytes for application in Li–O2 batteries. To address the drawback of weak mechanical strength of GPEs, a MnOOH@Al2O3 skeleton was designed to uniformly strengthen the mechanical properties of HGPEs, avoiding the inhomogeneity of powder fillers. The controllable thickness of the MnOOH@Al2O3 films enables the fabrication of an ultrathin HGPE with great mechanical properties. The highly porous network also has ensured the continuity of the filled GPE for high ionic conductivity. In this context, the suppression of Li dendrites and high ionic conductivity are simultaneously achieved in the HGPE. Benefiting from these merits, the Li metal symmetric cells with the HGPE exhibited stable cyclability for over 2100 h. The Li–O2 battery also delivered an ultralong cycle life of up to 494 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance also indicated the capability of the HGPE to effectively suppress Li dendrite growth. Here, the MnOOH nanowire was chosen as an example to show the fact that the assembled porous film with a free-standing structure can be used as the skeleton to simultaneously achieve suppression of Li dendrites and high ionic conductivity of the GPE. Actually, an ionically conductive nanowire-film, for example LLZO nanowires, may be a better candidate for preparing HGPEs. The present study may open a new way for reinforcing GPEs and offer an opportunity for developing quasi-solid-state LMBs.
