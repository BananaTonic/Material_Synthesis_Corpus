2.1Materials
Zirconium chloride (98%, Aladdin), 2-aminoterephthalic acid (99%, Aldrich), hydrochloric acid (36–38%, Beijing Chemical Works), nitric acid (65–68%, Beijing Chemical Works), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Beijing Chemical Works), methacryloylchloride (95%, Aladdin), triethylamine (99%, Aladdin), poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA, Mn = 1000 g mol−1, Aladdin), and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (98%, Macklin) were used directly without other processing. Dichloromethane (≥99.5%, Beijing Chemical Works) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, Beijing Chemical Works) were dried with CaH2 and then distilled before use. LiTFSI (99%, Aladdin) was dried at 80 °C for 24 h in a vacuum before use.
2.2Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Thermo Nicolet AVATAR 360 infrared instrument employing the attenuated total reflectance technique with the wavenumber from 4000 to 500 cm−1. A Hitachi SU8010 field emission scanning electron microscope was used to acquire the microstructures and morphologies of UiO-66-NH2, M-UiO-66-NH2 and the cross-linked electrolyte films (sputtered with Au for 30 s). X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured on an automated multipurpose X-ray diffractometer (Smartlab) with Cu-Kα X-ray radiation (λ = 1.54 Å). This equipment was operated at a high power of 9 kW, voltage of 45 kV, electric current of 200 mA and scan rate of 5° min−1. 1H NMR spectra were measured on a JNM-ECZ400S (JEOL, 400 MHz) spectrometer employing tetramethylsilane as the standard with d6-DMSO and HF as solvents at room temperature (RT, ∼28 °C). To acquire phase-transition temperature, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies were performed using a Q2000 calorimeter fabricated by TA Instruments in a nitrogen atmosphere with a cooling/heating rate of 20 °C min−1, and the samples were encapsulated in aluminum pans. Thermal stability analyses were performed using a Perkin Elmer TGA 1 series instrument with a thermal gravimetric analyzer from 30 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. A tensile testing machine (Instron 5900, the tensile speed was 2 mm min−1) was used to obtain the stress–strain curve of the HSPE-1-8.
2.3Synthesis of M-UiO-66-NH2
2.3.1Synthesis of UiO-66-NH2
Nanosized UiO-66-NH2 particles were prepared according to previous reports.36,37 Typically, ZrCl4 (pre-dissolved in a HCl/DMF mixture with v(HCl) : v(DMF) = 1 : 5) and 2-amino-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (pre-dissolved in DMF) at a molar ratio of 1 : 1.4 were mixed and heated at 80 °C overnight. The obtained sample was segregated by centrifugation. DMF and absolute ethyl alcohol were successively used to wash the sample 3 times. Finally, the product was dried at 100 °C for 24 h in a vacuum.
2.3.2Synthesis of M-UiO-66-NH2
UiO-66-NH2 (0.3 g) and trimethylamine (0.3 ml) were added to a round bottom flask containing 5 ml of CH2Cl2 under a N2 atmosphere. To obtain a homogeneous mixture, the mixture was mixed for 3 min through sonication. Methacryloylchloride (0.3 ml) was added dropwise to the mixture at 0 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 72 h. The obtained product was isolated through centrifugation. Deionized water and absolute ethyl alcohol were successively used to wash the sample 3 times. Finally, the product was dried at 40 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven.
2.4Preparation of M-UiO-66-NH-PEGDA hybrid all-solid-state polymer electrolytes
The hybrid covalently linked M-UiO-66-NH-PEGDA electrolyte was synthesized through photopolymerization of M-UiO-66-NH2 and PEGDA while using 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone as the photoinitiator (moderate LiTFSI was added to the mixture before photopolymerization). In this study, four types of M-UiO-66-NH-PEGDA hybrid solid-state polymer electrolytes were fabricated by changing the weight ratio of M-UiO-66-NH2 and PEGDA (mUiO-66-NH2 : mPEGDA = 0 : 1, 1 : 10, 1 : 8 and 1 : 5, respectively) while keeping the [EO]/[Li] = 20; according to the contents of PEGDA and the modified MOF, the obtained electrolytes were named P-PEGDA, HSPE-1-10, HSPE-1-8 and HSPE-1-5, respectively. Specifically, M-UiO-66-NH2 (0, 12, 15, and 24 mg, respectively) was mixed with PEGDA (0.12 g), 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (4 wt% of the total weight contents of monomers) and LiTFSI solution (0.1 g ml−1, dissolved in THF). After sonication for 5 min, the homogeneous solutions were separately poured into a polytetrafluoroethylene mould. Then THF was mostly steamed out after 20 min at RT. Afterwards, the mould containing the samples were exposed to a UV lamp (λ = 360 nm, W = 1 kW, GGJ-X1000) for 5 min. Finally, the all-solid-state electrolytes were obtained after the samples were dried at 100 °C for 24 h under vacuum.
2.5Electrochemical measurements
The ionic conductivities of the P-PEGDA and the HSPEs (sealed in a stainless steel mold) were measured on a Zahner-Ennium electrochemical workstation via EIS with a two-probe method. The AC amplitude was 5 mV, the frequency ranged from 1 Hz to 1 MHz, and the temperatures were set from 30 to 80 °C with a step size of 10 °C.
The ionic conductivity was obtained using the following equation:1where L is the thickness of the electrolyte membrane, R is the bulk resistance of the electrolyte membrane, and S is the contact area of the electrode and electrolyte.
The interfacial compatibilities of the P-PEGDA and the HSPE-1-8 were measured by monitoring the interfacial resistance of the Li/electrolytes/Li cells at RT for various times while the frequency ranged from 1 mHz to 10 MHz.
The electrochemical stability window of the HSPE-1-8 was measured using the Zahner-Ennium electrochemical workstation with a cell of Li/HSPE-1-8/stainless steel coin cell, and its linear sweep voltammogram was recorded at RT at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 from 3 to 7 V (vs. Li+/Li).
Galvanostatic cycling of the Li/Li symmetrical cell using HSPE-1-8 was conducted at a current density of 50 μA cm−2 (cycled at RT). Both the charge and discharge times were 6 h, respectively.
The cycle performance and rate capacity of the HSPE-1-8 were evaluated using cells of LiFePO4 (LFP)/HSPE-1-8/Li. The cathode consisted of LFP (70 wt%), super P (20 wt%) and PVDF (10 wt%, binder). A LANHE CT2001A battery testing system was used for all the tests of the all-solid-state cells at 60 °C or 28 °C with the voltage range from 2.5 to 4 V.
