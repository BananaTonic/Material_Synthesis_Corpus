Experimental section
The Ln6−xMoO12−δ (Ln = La, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu; x = 0, 0.5) materials were prepared using the mechanical activation of starting oxides followed by high-temperature heat treatment of green compacts. All of the rare-earth oxides and molybdenum oxide used in our preparations were 99.9% pure.
After preheating the starting Ln2O3 (Ln = La, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) oxides at 1000 °C for 2 h, they were mixed with MoO3 and co-milled in a SPEX 8000 ball mill for 1 h. MoO3 was previously activated in a high energy Aronov ball mill for 4 min. The mechanically activated mixtures of the oxides were uniaxially pressed at 680–914 MPa and sintered at 900, 1100, and 1200 °C for 4 h, and 1400, 1500 °C and 1600 °C for 3 h.
The geometric density of the as-prepared ceramics ranged from 64 to 96.38% of the theoretical one (Table 1). All samples were characterized structurally. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the polycrystalline samples were collected at room temperature on a DRON-3M automatic diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å, Bragg-reflection geometry, 35 kV, 28 mA) in the 2θ range 13° to 65° (scan step 0.1°). Table 1 summarizes the color, density, and crystallographic characteristics of the samples.

An excitation energy of 20 keV was chosen as the accelerating voltage. The L-shells of Mo, La, Gd, Dy, Ho, Er, and Tm, and the M-shells of Yb and Lu were used for EDX analysis. 5–14 spectra were collected for each sample for Ln/Mo ratio determination. EDX measurements, as well as recording of the SEM images, were carried out in high vacuum mode (pressure p ≈ 4 × 10−6 mbar). To prevent shifts in the images and heating of the sample caused by charging effects, the sample was coated with a 4 nm gold layer (Quorum Q150R ES) before the analysis. Microanalysis data of the Ln and Mo-containing samples are presented in Table 2.

Both faces of the disk-shaped polycrystalline samples sintered as described above (2–3 mm thick with a diameter of 9–10 mm) were covered with Pt ink (ChemPur C3605) and fired at 1000 °C for 30 min.
The temperature dependence of the total (electronic and ionic) conductivity of La5.5MoO11.25 in dry and wet air was extracted from impedance spectra obtained using a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer. The spectra were recorded in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz on cooling from 900 °C to 150 °C; the root mean square ac voltage amplitude was set to 150 mV. Depending on the atmosphere and temperature it took from 2 to 5 h for the samples to reach the equilibrium conductivity values. The relative humidity of the air fed into the sample stage was controlled by passing it over freshly dehydrated silica gel (designated “dry”) or through a water saturator maintained at 20 °C (designated “wet”), which ensured a constant water content of about 2%.
Electrical conductivity measurements of the two polymorphs, Yb6MoO12 bixbyite (Ia3̄) and Yb6MoO12 rhombohedral (R3̄), were performed using a P-5X potentiostat/galvanostat combined with a frequency response analyzer module (Elins Ltd, Russia) over the frequency range of 500 kHz to 0.1 Hz at a signal amplitude of 150 mV in the temperature range of 100–900 °C. A dry atmosphere was created by passing air through KOH and a wet atmosphere through a water saturator held at 20 °C. The air flow rate is 130 ml min−1.
