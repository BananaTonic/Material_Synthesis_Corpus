Experimental
Material preparation
Na3V2−xMnx(PO4)3 materials (x = 0 and 0.1, hereafter referred to as NVP and NVMP, respectively) were synthesized via a combustion method. The solution was prepared by dissolving stoichiometric NaH2PO4, NH4VO3, Mn(NO3)2·6H2O, citric acid, and sucrose in 160 ml of distilled water with a molar ratio of Na : V + Mn : P = 3 : 2 : 3, where the added maximum molar ratio of Mn : V was 0.1 : 1.9. The dissolved solution was vigorously stirred for 2 h. The solution was then stirred and heated at 120 °C for 6 h to produce a sol, which was subsequently combusted at 200 °C. The as-burnt sample was transferred into an electric furnace and further heated at 400 °C for 12 h in air to remove any remaining organic compounds. This powder precursor was calcined at 900 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 10 h with heating/cooling rates of 5 °C min−1.
The as-received powders (5 g) were mixed with pitch (0.25 g) dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone, and the mixtures were stirred and heated at 120 °C for 6 h in an Ar-filled atmosphere to prevent possible oxidation during the coating process. The collected powder mixture was heated at 750 °C for 2 h under an Ar stream for carbonization of the pitch.
Characterization
The produced powders were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD; PANalytical). Rietveld refinement of the XRD data was performed using the program Fullprof.36 The particle morphologies were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Hitachi H-800). The optical absorbances of the powders were determined using Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw InVia) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy (Avantes AvaLight-DHS). The UV-vis spectra of the synthesized powders were used to derive the bandgap energy, which was calculated using the Kubelka–Munk equation.37 The direct-current electrical conductivity was measured using the direct volt–ampere method (CMT-SR1000, AIT), in which disc samples, 0.785 cm2 × 3 mm thickness, were contacted with a four-point probe. An elemental analyzer (EA110, CE Instruments) was used to determine the amount of carbon in the final products.
Computational details
First-principles calculations were conducted to estimate the energies of the given materials based on the spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using DFT. We used a plane-wave basis set and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method42 implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).43 PAW potentials have shown good predictive capability in cathode materials for Li rechargeable batteries, and the Hubbard parameter was added to correct for the self-interaction of GGA. Ueff values for V and Mn of 3.32 and 2.44 eV, respectively, were selected, which were previously used in studies on Na3V2(PO4)3 (ref. 40) and Na4Mn3(PO4)2(P2O7).41 A plane-wave basis with an energy cutoff of 500 eV was used. All the structures were optimized until the force in the unit cell converged to within 0.05 eV Å−1.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties were measured using R2032 coin-type cells. The electrodes were fabricated from a mixture of the prepared powders Na3V2−xMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0 and 0.1) (85 wt%), Super P carbon black (7.5 wt%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (7.5 wt%) in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP). For the carbon-coated composites for which the final amount of carbon residue was approximately 2.9 wt% as analyzed by an elemental analyzer, the electrode was a mixture of active materials (87.6 wt%), Super P carbon black (4.95 wt%), and PVDF (7.5 wt%), finally equalizing the amount of active materials and carbon content for both the non-coated and carbon-coated composite electrodes. The obtained slurry was then applied onto Al foil and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 1 h. The electrode was further dried overnight at 80 °C under vacuum. The typical amount of loaded active material was approximately 3 mg cm−2. The electrolyte was 0.5 M NaPF6 in polycarbonate (PC) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (98 : 2 v/v). Glass filters (GB-100R, Whatman) were used as separators to isolate the Na metal anode in the coin cells. The fabricated cells were charged and discharged in the voltage range of 2.5–4.3 V with a constant current of 20 mA g−1 at 25 °C. For the full cell test, carbon-coated Na3V2−xMnx(PO4)3 (x = 0 and 0.1) cathodes were paired with presodiated hard carbon anodes obtained from direct contact with sodium metal, balanced with a N/P ratio of 1.2 based on the specific capacities of the electrodes. The same electrolyte and glass filter separators were used for the full cells. The assembled cells were charged/discharged at different current densities from 24 mA g−1 (at 0.2C) to 6000 mA g−1 (at 50C) at 25 °C.
Post-cycled electrodes
Operando XRD (O-XRD) measurements were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical), of which the custom-built hermitically sealed in situ cell was charged and discharged under the same conditions as those used for the coin cells. The lattice parameters were calculated using the following method: the positions of the individual peaks were fitted with a pseudo-Voigt or Lorentz function, and the peak positions were used as inputs to minimize the least-squares difference between the calculated and measured peak positions by adjusting the lattice constant and vertical displacement of the sample. To further investigate the structural change occurring during charge and discharge, we employed XANES analysis to follow the average oxidation states of the vanadium and manganese elements in the compounds during charge and discharge in Na cells. The XANES measurements were performed at the 8C Nano XAFS beam line at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Pohang, South Korea. The K-edge XANES data were taken in total electron yield mode, and the sample current was recorded. Ion chamber detectors filled with high-purity N2 were used to record the XANES spectra. Ex situ XRD and TEM were used to investigate the structural changes occurring in the active material during cycling. To prepare the ex situ XRD samples, the coin cells were disassembled in an Ar-filled glove box, and the electrodes were washed with salt-free dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The washed electrodes were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. The ex situ XRD patterns were carefully calibrated using the aluminum current collector as the internal standard.
Thermal stability
After charging to 4.3 V, the coin cells were disassembled in a glove box, and the electrodes were washed by immersion in salt-free DMC for 1 day. The electrodes were centrifuged in NMP to remove the PVDF and conducting carbon, leaving only the desodiated powders after vacuum drying at 80 °C for 1 day. The electrochemically desodiated powders (3−5 mg) were loaded into stainless-steel-sealed pans with gold-plated copper seals (which can withstand 150 atm pressure before rupturing and have a capacity of 30 μL). These measurements were performed using a calorimeter (Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1) using a temperature ramp rate of 1 °C min−1. The weight was constant in all cases, indicating that no leaks occurred during the experiments.
