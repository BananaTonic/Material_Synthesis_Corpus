Experimental
Powder synthesis
To synthesize the NHP powders, P2O5 (1.067 g, 7.517 mM, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was saturated with hexanes (anhydrous, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) in a dry N2-purged glove box and then NaH2PO4·H2O (1.038 g, 7.522 mM, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) and HfO2 (3.166 g, 15.04 mM, 99.99%, Alfa-Aesar) were added. This mixture was thoroughly ground with a mortar and pestle, placed in an alumina crucible, and ramped at 5 °C min−1 to 1050 °C in air, where it was held for 12 h before cooling to room temperature at 5 °C min−1.
NZP powders were synthesized in the same manner as NHP powders, except an equimolar quantity of ZrO2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) was substituted for HfO2.
Thin film synthesis
NHP thin films were prepared via chemical solution deposition, adapting procedures recently reported for the growth of NZP thin films.31,39 It should be noted that the present chemistry is distinct from methods used by other groups, including 2-methoxyethanol-based routes for thin films,32 or oxalic acid-based sol–gel routes for NaSICON powders.33
In a dry, argon-filled glovebox, hafnium(iv) n-butoxide (1.695 g, 3.60 mmol, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1-butanol (9.56 mL, 104 mmol, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich), dibutyl phosphate (1.135 g, 5.400 mmol, &gt;97.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), and sodium ethoxide (0.123 g, 1.81 mmol, &gt;95%, Fluka) were sequentially added to a 20 mL glass vial, ensuring thorough mixing between additions. This NHP precursor solution was magnetically stirred overnight at room temperature. These solutions were further diluted with 1-butanol to obtain NHP concentrations of 0.15 or 0.3 M.
In air, platinized silicon wafers37 (100 nm Pt//40 nm ZnO//400 nm SiO2//Si (001)) were coated with 0.15 M NHP precursor solution filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter, spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s, placed on a 300 °C hotplate for 5 minutes, and loaded into an air-filled tube furnace preheated to 775 °C for 10 minutes. Samples were subsequently removed and allowed to cool to room temperature. This process was repeated for 3 layers total.
A similar process was used to coat NZSP pellets. Here 0.3 M NHP precursor solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter, spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and loaded into an air-filled furnace which was ramped at 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 775 °C, held for 10 minutes, and cooled back to room temperature at 10 °C min−1. This process was repeated for three or six layers. Later, a revised thermal treatment was developed where 0.15 M NHP precursor solution was filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter, spun at 3000 rpm for 30 s, placed on a 300 °C hot plate for 5 minutes, and then cooled to room temperature. This process was repeated for three layers. After the third layer, the NZSP pellets were transferred directly from the 300 °C hotplate to a furnace preheated to 300 °C. The furnace was then ramped at 10 °C min−1 to 775 °C, held for 10 minutes, and cooled to room temperature at 10 °C min−1. This three-layer coating and annealing process was performed twice to create 6 layers of NHP on the NZSP pellet (“6 L revised NHP”). All NZSP pellets were 25 mm in diameter, 1.0 mm thick, obtained from Ceramatec Corporation (Salt Lake City, UT, USA), and characterized in depth elsewhere.14,15
Chemical stability of ceramic powders
Bulk powder stability was evaluated by immersing 0.250 g of NHP or NZP powder in 10 mL of electrolyte (e.g., 10 M KOH), sealed in a Teflon-lined autoclave, and heated to 80 °C for 72 h. After removing the autoclave from the oven and cooling to room temperature, the solution was transferred to a 25 mL centrifuge tube and spun at 2450 × g for 10 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and 10 mL fresh 18.2 MΩ cm deionized water used to resuspend and wash the powder before centrifuging again. This washing process was repeated until the pH of the supernatant registered 7, as judged by pH paper. The solids were separated and dried overnight under 20 mTorr vacuum. The dried solid was interrogated by X-ray diffraction (XRD).
Electrochemical measurements
90 nm thick platinum top electrodes approximately 0.003 cm2 were sputtered through a shadow mask onto the NHP thin films; actual areas were measured with optical microscopy and image analysis. NHP thin film ionic conductivity of NHP films was evaluated using impedance spectroscopy with an HP 4192 LCR meter over a range of 1 MHz to 112 Hz with a 50 mV (rms) oscillator in a metal–electrolyte–metal geometry. The top and bottom platinum electrodes serve as Na-ion blocking electrodes. Fits to the complex plane impedance data were performed with Bio-Logic EC-Lab software. A circuit element of a constant phase element in parallel with a resistor was used to model the ionic conductivity of the NHP electrolyte and a constant phase element in series to model the blocking electrodes. An additional series resistor was used to account for resistances of the metal electrodes, which proved to be negligible. Temperature dependent measurements were performed within a Delta Design 9023 environmental chamber between 25 and 200 °C.
NZSP pellets with and without NHP coatings on one side were evaluated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and open circuit potential (OCP) measurements in electrolyte heated to 80 °C. EIS measurements occurred at 0 V DC with respect to the open circuit potential (OCP) with a 5 mV RMS AC amplitude over 1 MHz to −100 mHz using a Solartron Modulab system.
For conductance measurements in aqueous NaOH, an NZSP pellet was sealed in a NW-10 vacuum flange in a water-jacketed U-shaped glass cell (Adams and Chittenden, Berkeley, CA, USA). 5 mL of electrolyte was placed on each side of the cell. A four electrode cell was constructed: on one side a large area platinum mesh served as the current source, while a freshly polished 1.6 mm diameter platinum disc electrode (MF-2013 BASi, Inc.), placed near the NZSP pellet, measured the potential of the electrolyte. On the other side of the NZSP pellet, another platinum disc electrode measured the electrolyte potential and a platinum mesh served as the current sink. To evaluate the chemical stability of the NZSP pellets, a three electrode electrochemical cell was fashioned using the NZSP pellet as the working electrode, a large area platinum mesh as the counter electrode, and a freshly polished 1.6 mm platinum disc as the pseudo reference electrode (standard reference electrodes were avoided, as their porous glass frits etch rapidly in hot, concentrated KOH). A gold wire was electrically contacted to an NZSP pellet using silver paint (Ted Pella Leitsilber 200), added to the side not coated with NHP, and the paint was dried at 80 °C for 1 h in air. Upon cooling, a standard two part epoxy (Extra fast setting, Royal Adhesives &amp; Sealants, Wilmington, CA) was used to mechanically stabilize the silver–gold connection. A viton gasket sealed the NHP-coated side of the pellet against a glass NW-10 vacuum flange in a water-jacketed U-shaped glass cell (Adams and Chittenden, Berkeley, CA, USA). The dry assembled cell was then preheated to 80 °C using a circulating bath to heat the cell jacket, and the electrolyte was separately heated to 80 °C on a hotplate. After all components reached 80 °C, 5 mL hot electrolyte was added to the electrochemical cell (on the side of the pellet coated with NHP) and the measurements commenced.
Material characterization
NaSICON phase chemistry and crystallinity were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Bruker D2 Phaser system set in the traditional Bragg–Brentano geometry with Cu Kα radiation. NHP thin film microstructure was evaluated in plan-view and cross section using a Zeiss Supra 55VP scanning electron microscope (SEM) at 3 kV and 5 mm working distance in an in-lens imaging mode.
