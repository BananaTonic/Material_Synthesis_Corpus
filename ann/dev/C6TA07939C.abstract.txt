An attractive anionic metalloring organic framework (MROF-1) containing unprecedented sextuply interlocked nanocages made up of original metalloring clusters with the largest diameter of ca. 21 Å shows a high proton conductivity up to 1.72 × 10−2 S cm−1 at 70 °C and 97% RH, owing to plenty of counter cations (Me2NH2)+ located in the 1D channels.
