Preparation of LiPON/A-LLTO pellets
A-LLTO powder with the nominal composition of (Li0.33La0.56)1.005Ti0.99Al0.01O3 was prepared via the citrate-gel method from LiNO3, La(NO3)3·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, titanium isopropoxide, ethylene glycol, and citric acid, as well as an excess amount of LiNO3 of 20 mol% to avoid the loss of Li due to the volatilization of lithium-oxide during the synthesis. The detailed preparation process has been described elsewhere.36 The A-LLTO powder obtained after annealing at 750 °C was ground and pelletized under a high pressure of 350 MPa. To prevent further Li loss, the powdery pellets were then covered and embedded in the powder of the same composition before being sintered at 1350 °C for 6 h to obtain the final product of ceramic pellets. The surface of the A-LLTO ceramic pellets was polished carefully using abrasive papers from #180 to #2000 grade to obtain a thickness of 200 ± 5 μm. A 200 ± 5 nm thin interlayer of LiPON was then deposited on one or both sides of the A-LLTO pellets for 2 h at an optimised temperature, particularly 400 °C, under the N2 atmosphere with a pressure of 5 mTorr and RF power of 100 W using the RF-sputtering method.
Physical characterization
The microstructural and chemical characterizations of the materials were conducted using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD; D/MAX Ultima III, Rigaku diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation), a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; Hitachi S-4700), and an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy system (XPS; a MultiLab 2000, VG). For clear observation, the surface of the A-LLTO ceramic pellet was heat etched at 1300 °C for 2 h before FE-SEM analysis. The chemical compositions of materials were analysed using inductive coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES; OPTIMA 8300 DV).
The temperature dependence of ionic conductivity of the ceramic pellets was obtained from AC impedance measurements using an impedance analyser (ZIVE SP2) in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. Prior to the impedance measurement, for good contact with the samples, the samples were coated with a 20 nm-thick platinum thin film on both sides and connected with silver glue before annealing at 500 °C for 1 h. The active area for the impedance measurements was 0.28 cm2. The testing temperature was controlled to be between 5 and 65 °C. In order to evaluate the stability of A-LLTO ceramics before and after the deposition of LiPON against the Li metal electrode, R2032 coin cells with the symmetric configuration of Li/LiPON/A-LLTO/LiPON/Li and Li/A-LLTO/Li were prepared in an argon-filled glove box before impedance measurements in an air atmosphere at 25 °C.
Electrochemical characterization
The LiPON/A-LLTO pellet with 16 mm in diameter was employed in an aprotic type Li–O2 cell as a solid electrolyte. These modified coin-type Li–O2 cells were assembled in the argon-filled glove box. The configuration of the Li–O2 cell is shown in Fig. S1. For the Li–O2 cells, the stainless steel cover of the positive side in the coin cells was drilled to make 17 holes of 1 mm diameter, which were evenly distributed to allow the ingress of oxygen gas. A separator of Whatman® glass fibre impregnated with organic electrolyte of 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) was placed between the LiPON/A-LLTO pellet and the oxygen electrode to activate the full cell composed of Li/LiPON/A-LLTO/separator/oxygen electrode. Meanwhile, 5 μL of organic electrolyte was inserted between the Li and LiPON/A-LLTO to ensure good surface contact. In this study, carbon and binder free type oxygen electrodes were prepared using the hydrothermal method. Firstly, Ni foam with a thickness of 200 μm was rinsed in ethanol ultrasonically, etched in 1 M HCl solution, and rinsed with deionized water. Subsequently, Ni foam was placed into the autoclave, which contained a 500 mL solution blend of 0.02 M KMnO4, 0.01 M MnSO4, and a few drops of NH3 (28 v%) solution to maintain the solution pH in the alkaline range. The autoclave was heated to 150 °C and then maintained for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the Ni foam was rinsed with deionized water and finally annealed at 450 °C for 5 h. The charge–discharge behaviour of the Li–O2 cells was investigated using a Wonatech battery cycler. All potentials are hereafter reported as indicated potential versus Li/Li+ potential.
