Conclusions
A scalable PEO-LAGP-SN composite solid polymer electrolyte enhanced by bifunctional SN was successfully prepared via a convenient technique. It is notable that this neoteric SPE presents a high conductivity of 1.26 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C with liquid-modified PEO in a LiTFSI–SN mixture. The SPE-14-15 electrolyte possesses a wide window of 2 to 4.9 V. Moreover, the tLi+ of this SPE was greatly improved by immobilizing TFSI− in the LAGP and PEO matrix, indicating excellent Li-ion-dominant conduction behaviour. It is important that the high DLi+, tLi+ and low J can effectively enhance the stability against the Li electrode and the ability to impede Li dendrite growth. This discovery can be used as guidance in designing composite electrolytes for LMBs. The Li|SPE-14-15|LFP cell exhibits excellent cycling and rate performance at 40 °C. The discharge specific capacity at 0.5C is 142.6 mA h g−1 at 40 °C, and 91.2% of the initial capacity can be retained after 200 cycles. We believe that these scalable SPEs with enhanced performance can be used as promising candidates for next-generation electrolytes to replace the conventional flammable liquid electrolytes and separator membranes for ASSLMBs.
