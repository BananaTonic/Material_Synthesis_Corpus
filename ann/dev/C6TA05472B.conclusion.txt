Conclusions
Protic organic ionic plastic crystals (POIPCs) are promising solid-state proton conductors. As a special mesophase, their isotropy happens before their transition into a molten state. With guanidinium nonaflate ([Gdm-H][NfO]) as an example, we show that solid-state proton conductors based on POIPCs can be achieved via appropriate molecular design involving symmetrical ions. Differential scanning calorimetry and variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction measurements together reveal the presence of plastic crystalline phases in the temperature range between 88 °C and 185 °C. As expected, [Gdm-H][NfO] exhibits a short-range disorder and a long-range positional order in the plastic crystalline phases. Above 176 °C, the ionic conductivity of [Gdm-H][NfO] exceeds 1 × 10−4 S cm−1 prior to its melting point at 186.2 °C. In the high temperature plastic crystalline phase, the elegant symmetrical guanidinium cations of [Gdm-H][NfO] seem to rotate freely, leading to a simpler crystal structure of higher symmetry and fast ion conduction. The vehicle mechanism is assumed to be the underlying conduction mechanism in the plastic crystalline phases of [Gdm-H][NfO]. In the molten state, the proton conduction is proposed to occur via both the vehicle mechanism and the Grotthuss mechanism (structural diffusion). Due to the exceptional physicochemical properties such as high thermal stability, negligible volatility, non-flammability, no leakage, high electrochemical stability, high anhydrous proton conductivity, and wide plastic crystalline phases, POIPCs like [Gdm-H][NfO] are attractive electrolytes for high temperature (100–200 °C) proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), in particular, all-solid-state high temperature PEMFCs. In addition to its role as a dopant to replace H3PO4 for state-of-the-art membrane matrices, [Gdm-H][NfO] may also function as a solid-state matrix for acids to develop more conductive proton conductors. It is anticipated that POIPC-based fast solid-state proton conductors will also find applications in sensors and other electrochemical devices. Further work on [Gdm-H][NfO] (e.g. demonstration in practical fuel cells) is in progress in our labs. It is noteworthy that poly(ionic liquid)s offer promising membrane matrices for solid-state proton conductors.47
