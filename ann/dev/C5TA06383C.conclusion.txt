4Conclusions and outlook
We have shown that BaFeO2.5 can be reversibly transformed into two different hydrated modifications, LW-BaFeO2.5 and HW-BaFeO2.5, depending on the detailed hydration temperature used, transforming the compound from a poor electron conductor into a proton conductor with a grain proton conductivity in the range of ∼10−6 to 10−7 S cm−1 in dry atmospheres around ambient temperatures. This represents the first report of proton conductivity in a Fe based perovskite, and raises potential applications in solid oxide fuel cells and/or electrolysers and H2 separation membranes.
In order to take this work further, thin film studies are required to eliminate the grain boundary contribution. Also, the conductivity is intended to be studied under variable oxidizing and non-oxidizing, wet and dry, atmospheres to obtain a deeper understanding of the conditions where proton conductivity can be regarded to be superior compared to the electronic contribution. Furthermore, chemical substitution of the A- and B-site cations might be expected to allow for material optimization with regards to the magnitude of the proton and electronic contribution to the conductivity, as well as the stability.
