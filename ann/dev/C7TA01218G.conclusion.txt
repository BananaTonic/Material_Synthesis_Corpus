4Conclusions
A novel alkaline group, HMTA with four functionalities, is proposed as a mono-quaternization reagent in the present work. PSF-QuOH membranes have been successfully synthesized through a heterogeneous quaternization route. With strong electrostatic interactions among polymer chains, PSF-QuOH AEMs effectively restrict water swelling at high IECs. The obtained high concentration of hydroxide and the continuous hydrogen-bond networks between mono-quaternized HMTA and hydroxide/water are helpful to improve hydroxide conductivity at low water swelling. The PSF-QuOH 2.23 membrane shows high hydroxide conductivity of 35 mS cm−1 at 20 °C, which is within the best main-chain-type AEMs with different alkaline functional groups at similar swelling ratios. Meanwhile, swelling ratio is restricted well at around 21% at 60 °C and the mechanical strength could be kept at 17.7 MPa. 86% of the initial hydroxide conductivity could be retained after 1 M KOH immersion at 60 °C for 168 h.
