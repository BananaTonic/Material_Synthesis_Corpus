The development of fast-charging lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is an urgent necessity. Nevertheless, it is still a huge challenge to prepare superior high-rate cathode materials for LIBs. In this work, porous Mg–Ti co-doped LiFe0.985Mg0.005Ti0.01PO4 microspheres are successfully synthesized via a carbothermic reduction reaction in combination with a spray drying process, with FePO4 as the Fe and P source. Through X-ray diffraction (XRD) combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) Ar+-sputtering technology, it confirms that Mg and Ti are in the form of doping rather than surface recombination inside LiFePO4 microspheres, and the existence of Fe3+ inside the samples is confirmed as residual FePO4. Compared to the undoped sample, the porous Mg–Ti co-doped LiFePO4 microspheres show great improvement in electronic conductivity (1.58 × 10−3 S cm−1) and diffusion coefficient (5.97 × 10−9 cm s−1 for charging and 4.30 × 10−9 cm s−1 for discharging). More importantly, the porous Mg–Ti co-doped LiFe0.985Mg0.005Ti0.01PO4 microspheres show excellent high-rate capabilities, delivering a discharge capacity of 161.5, 160.3, 156.7, 147.5, 139.8 and 131.5 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 3C, 5C and 8C, respectively.
