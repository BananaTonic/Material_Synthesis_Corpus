Conclusions
We prepared two POPs (1E and 1ES) using a microwave-assisted solvothermal method. Porous material 1E was successfully modified via a postsynthetic sulfonation process to obtain a polymer (1ES) covalently tethered with sulfonic acid groups. The high proton conductivity achieved by 1ES (1.59 × 10−1 S cm−1 at 80 °C and 90% RH) is due to the facilitation of proton transfer along the conduction channels by the covalently attached sulfonic acid groups. To the best of our knowledge, the achieved conductivity exceeds those of any other POPs reported to date. The present material with exceptional conductivity and significant long-term performance (&gt;4 months) has potential for application in PEMFCs.
