Conclusions
In conclusion, the CGMD computation predicts that grafting hydrophobic chains onto both the nitrogen center and backbone effectively induces quaternary ammonium aggregation. Meanwhile, CGMD simulations offer reliable evidence for inspecting the effects of graft density and graft length on micro-morphologies, demonstrating that C16C6-X40Y10 with the largest population of grafted alkyl chains has the most prominent micro-phase separation. The experimental results further reveal that C16C6-X40Y10 exhibits a pretty high hydroxide conductivity of 61 mS cm−1 at 30 °C, although its water uptake is only 15.8%. The maximum power density of a H2/O2 fuel cell with the incorporated C16C6-X40Y10 reaches 322 mW cm−2. This newly designed unique architecture will serve as a platform for exploring promising AAEMs. Imparting more robust backbones and cationic head-groups on this platform will accelerate the development of commercially available AAEMs.
