Experimental
Sample preparation
[Gdm-H][NfO] was prepared by combination of equimolar amounts of nonaflic acid (n-C4F9SO3H, TCI, 98%) and carbonate salt of guanidine (NH2C(NH)NH2·½H2CO3, Alfa Aesar, 98%). The nonaflic acid was firstly diluted and then slowly added to a solution of the carbonate salt of guanidine under magnetic stirring in an ice bath for 3 h. The mixture was further heated at 120 °C in a silicon oil bath for 24 h to promote the neutralization reaction. Bubbles of carbon dioxide were released during the reaction. After the reaction, the compound was purified by heating it on a Schlenk line in vacuo at 190 °C for 18 h to remove water and the excess base or acid (if any), resulting in a dry crystalline powder. The purified samples were stored in an argon-filled glove box prior to further characterizations.
Deuterated guanidinium nonaflate [Gdm-D][NfO] (Fig. 1) was prepared as follows: 10.0 g of D2O (99.9 at.% D, InnoChem, Beijing) was used to dissolve 2.0 g of [Gdm-H][NfO] (n([Gdm-H][NfO]) : n(D2O) = 1 : 90) in a well-sealed flask with magnetic stirring for 12 h. The solution was then stored at room temperature for 1 week. The deuterated sample was thereafter dried at 55 °C on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain a white solid. Then the deuteration process was repeated using 10.0 g of D2O (100.0 at.% D, Acros Organics) as the solvent for the once deuterated sample. The obtained solution was kept at room temperature for another week to guarantee further deuteration. The solution was again dried at 55 °C on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain a white solid. The sample was further dried by evacuating on a Schlenk line at 200 °C for 12 h to eliminate remaining heavy water and then ground to fine powders in a glove box (water content and oxygen content both below 0.1 ppm).
Water content determination
The water content of purified [Gdm-H][NfO] was found to be less than 2000 ppm by volumetric Karl Fischer titration (870 KF Titrino plus, Metrohm).
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis
The FTIR spectra of the ([Gdm-H][NfO] and [Gdm-D][NfO]) powders at room temperature were recorded in the spectral range between 650 and 4000 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1 using an FTIR spectrometer (NEXUS, Thermo Nicolet) with a universal ATR accessory.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
TGA measurements were performed on a STA 449 C Jupiter® simultaneous thermal analyzer (Netzsch). The sample was placed in an Al2O3 pan and heated from room temperature to 650 °C at a ramp of 5 °C min−1 in a nitrogen or air atmosphere (50 mL min−1). The onset temperature of mass loss was reported as the decomposition temperature (Td).
Isothermogravimetric analysis (IGA) experiments were conducted on the same instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere (50 mL min−1) at 150, 225, 250 and 275 °C, respectively. The initial mass of each sample was controlled to be around 11.1 mg. Prior to each IGA measurement, each sample was heated from room temperature to the target temperatures at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
DSC measurements were performed on a Pyris 1 Thermal Analysis System (PerkinElmer). Measurements were made between −100 °C and 200 °C at heating/cooling rates of 10, 15 and 20 °C min−1. Three consecutive runs were conducted for each heating/cooling rate, wherein the first two heating/cooling scans were performed to eliminate the thermal history effects.
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
Temperature-dependent XRD measurements of fine powders of [Gdm-H][NfO] were performed from room temperature to 185 °C under vacuum on a powder X-ray diffractometer (X'Pert PRO DY2198, PANalytical) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) to identify the solid–solid phase transitions. The sample was stabilized at each measurement temperature (accuracy: ±1 °C) for 2 min before each measurement. The measurement consisted of θ–2θ scan from 5° to 50° with a step size of 0.017° and a scan speed of 0.4° s−1.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance™ III 400 MHz spectrometer at room temperature. δH (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ/ppm): 6.88 (s, 6H, [C(NH2)3]+); δC (101 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ/ppm): 158.31. The concentration of the samples for 1H NMR tests was controlled to be the same for all measurements.
Morphological observations
Polarized optical microscopy was used to confirm the solid-solid phase transitions or detect the possibility of partial melting via recording the morphological changes of fine powders of [Gdm-H][NfO] during the heating scan (5 °C min−1) from 35 °C to 190 °C. The fine powders were placed between two thin glass plates and then heated on a Linkam TMS 93 heating/cooling microscope stage (accuracy: ±0.1 °C) and focused on by an Olympus BX60 imaging microscope with a 10×/0.30 objective lens.
Conductivity measurements
The temperature and frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity (dielectric constant) of [Gdm-H][NfO] was studied using an Alpha-Analyzer high resolution dielectric analyzer in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 10 MHz with an AC voltage of 100 mV (Vrms). The material was placed in a stainless steel conductivity cell (diameter: 20 mm; thickness: 0.50 mm) and then heated to 200 °C to ensure complete filling of the cell. The dielectric measurements were started at 200 °C followed by cooling to −150 °C in steps of 2.5 °C at an initial rate of 10 °C min−1, and then subjected to temperature stabilization for 10 min. Afterwards, the sample was heated again from −150 °C to 200 °C and finally cooled down again to room temperature. The temperature was controlled by liquid nitrogen gas flow via the Novocontrol Quatro Cryosystem. By correlating the amplitude and phase of the current passing through the dielectric sample capacitor with the applied AC voltage, the Alpha-Analyzer can calculate the complex impedance and capacity. From these data, the complex conductivity and permittivity can be calculated, respectively. The conductivity was determined by a plateau in the conductivity vs. frequency plot, which lies in between the subdiffusive conductivity region and the electrode polarization region as discussed below.
When measuring the ionic conductivity of ionic liquids as a function of AC-voltage frequency, there are three regions of the ionic conductivity, each of which reveals certain material and sample properties.13a At very high frequencies, the conductivity is dominated by the subdiffusive conductivity, as determined by the sample geometry, giving the appearance of very high conductivity. At the low frequency end, due to incomplete charge transfer between the electrode and the organic salt, the conductivity is hindered by the electric double layer13b as a result of an effect known as electrode polarization, where the sample appears to have a very low conductivity. It is in the intermediate region that we can find the true sample conductivity, where the conductivity is high compared to the capacitive conductivity and low when compared to the electric double layer conductivity. For more information on how the ionic conductivity should be determined, we refer the readers to our previous work.13a The conductivity contribution from the empty cell is subtracted using a simple parallel impedance model, yielding the final conductivity. These steps are applied at every measurement temperature.
