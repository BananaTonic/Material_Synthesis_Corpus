Strontium vanadate-based perovskites are considered as promising anode materials for hydrocarbon-fueled solid oxide fuel cells due to high electronic conductivity, sulfur tolerance and resistance to coking, but possess a narrow phase stability domain precluding their use in practice. This study aimed at expanding the perovskite phase stability domain by donor-type substitutions focusing on Sr0.8Ln0.2V1−yNbyO3−δ (Ln = La or Y, y = 0–0.10) solid solutions. The upper-p(O2) stability boundary at 900 °C was found to shift from ∼10−15 atm for the parent strontium vanadate to ∼6 × 10−13 atm for Sr0.8Y0.2VO3−δ, whereas oxidative decomposition of Sr0.8La0.2VO3−δ occurs in the p(O2) range between 10−10 and 10−5 atm. Co-substitution by niobium in the vanadium sublattice has rather minor (Y-containing series) or even negative (La-containing series) effects on the perovskite phase stability boundary, but results in a slower kinetics of oxidative decomposition in an inert atmosphere. Sluggish oxidation kinetics in inert gas environments, demonstrated by electrical, thermogravimetric, dilatometric and structural studies, results in a nearly reversible behavior of Sr0.8Ln0.2V1−yNbyO3−δ after exposure to inert atmosphere, thus enabling the fabrication of solid-electrolyte cells with SrVO3−δ-based anodes under these conditions. Donor-type substitution is demonstrated also to decrease the electronic conductivity, which still remains sufficiently high for electrode application (&gt;100 S cm−1 at temperatures ≤950 °C), and to suppress chemical expansion thus improving the thermomechanical compatibility with solid electrolytes.
