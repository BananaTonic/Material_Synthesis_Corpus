Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted much attention due to their unique and fascinating physicochemical properties.1–4 Owing to their relatively high surface area and unusual electronic properties, 2D materials, including metal dichalcogenides, metal oxides, metal carbides, etc., have been widely studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors.2–8 Recently, 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a new class of electrode materials for supercapacitors.9–12 COFs and MOFs have a highly tunable pore structure and functional units. It is thus promising to design high-performance COF and MOF electrodes for supercapacitors. One of the major challenges is boosting their electrical conductivity without compromising their inherent structural characteristics.13–15 To construct conductive COFs, much effort has been focused on introducing functional groups, such as 4-thiophenephenyl,16 lithium imidazolate groups17 and other functional units18 into the framework skeleton. Recently, Xu et al. and Jeong et al. separately showed that the ionic conductivity of COFs can be highly improved by introducing Li+-responsive groups onto the surface of the pore channels.19,20 However, the electronic and ionic conductivity of these COFs are still limited, mainly ranging from 2.38 × 10−6 to 7.2 × 10−3 S cm−1.16–20 Therefore, new strategies need to be developed to construct COFs with high electrical conductivity for high pseudo-capacitance.
Examples of 2D conductive MOFs in applications of supercapacitors have been demonstrated. A redox-active conductive 2D MOF with an exceptionally high volumetric capacitance of 760 F cm−3 and a high areal capacitance of 20 F cm−2 was constructed based on hexaaminobenzene linkers and metal ions (Ni2+ or Cu2+).21 Sheberla and co-authors reported on a highly conductive MOF, [Ni3(HITP)2]n (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene), with high electrical conductivity (50 s cm−1) and high areal capacitance.22 Ni3(HITP)2 is composed of π-conjugated 2D layers, and each layer is constructed from HITP molecules and Ni2+ linkers. The high conductivity could be ascribe to the planar Ni(ii) coordination. Inspired by this, we aim to design a 2D COF with a highly conjugated structure and metal coordination. Herein, a conductive 2D Ni-containing covalent organic framework (Ni-COF) is thus designed and synthesized for high-performance supercapacitors. The Ni(ii)-Salphen units, accompanied by the π-conjugation, favour the formation of a planar structure, contributing to the 2D layered structure. The temperature-dependent electrical conductivity revealed that Ni-COF behaves as a semiconductor at room temperature. The high conductivity and high-density active sites result in remarkable capacitance and excellent cycling stability.
Ni-COF was solvothermally synthesized by reacting 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine (BTA) and 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzenedicarboxaldehyde (HBC) with Ni(OAc)2·4H2O at 120 °C for 3 days in a mixed solvent of mesitylene and 1,4-dioxane (Fig. 1a). The formation of Ni(ii)-Salphen units can compete with the aldehyde-amino Schiff-base reaction, which would likely slow down the nucleation and result in a crystalline COF. Ni-COF shows good chemical and thermal stability. No decomposition and dissolution were detected by soaking in boiling water, 3 M HCl, 3 M KOH and common organic solvents for 5 days (Fig. S1). TGA analysis confirmed the negligible weight loss below 250 °C (Fig. S2).

(c) The stick model with regular microporous (d) Simulated structure with a 2D eclipsed layered arrangement.
PXRD analysis was used to demonstrate the structure of Ni-COF. As shown in Fig. 1b, the strong peak at 6.8° is attributed to the (100) facet, while the minor peaks at 8.5, 9.0 10.8 and 25.5° are attributed to (200), (210), (220) and (001) facets, respectively.23 The presence of the (001) plane indicates π–π layered stacking.24 The experimental PXRD pattern agreed well with the simulated pattern based on the eclipsed stacking model, and the unit cell parameters were calculated (a = 13.5094 Å, b = 13.2250 Å, c = 24.1050 Å, α = 25.6050, β = 32.1431, and γ = 55.6497) with acceptable residuals (Rp = 5.37% and Rwp = 6.23%). Ni(ii) coordinates to two nitrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. The N–Ni–N angle is 87° and the O–Ni–O angle is 91°, resulting in a square-planar Ni(ii) coordination geometry. Six Ni(ii)-Salphen units as the apexes are connected through alternately sharing the benzene rings of benzenetetraamine benzenedihydroxy, which form a hexagonal macrocycle (Fig. 1c). These π-conjugated Salphen hexagons are further extended to generate a 2D honeycomb-like layer structure. The shortest intralayer Ni⋯Ni distance is 7.6 Å, resulting in hexagonal pores with a pore size of 1.0 nm and a wall thickness of 0.3 nm. In addition, the pore-to-pore distance was calculated by using the Bragg equation according to the peak at 6.8°. It is 1.3 nm, which is consistent with the sum of pore diameters and wall thicknesses. It is noted that Ni-COF has a high Ni content of 17.6 wt%. From the simulated powder X-ray diffraction patterns, Ni-COF is verified to have a layered structure through an eclipsed stacking AA model with an interlayer separation of 3.4 Å (Fig. 1d).
According to the FT-IR spectra, the C–O stretching vibration of HBC at 1282 cm−1 shifts to 1295 cm−1 for Ni-COF (Fig. 2a), but is located at a similar place (1281 cm−1) for the COF without Ni2+ (Fig. S3). The shift thus could be ascribed to the Ni(ii) coordination. The appearance of a signal from CN (1621 cm−1) and the concomitant disappearance of the characteristic N–H stretching vibration (3389–3197 cm−1) and the CO stretching band (1654 cm−1) demonstrated the formation of Ni(ii)-Salphen units (Fig. 2a).25,26 The 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum of Ni-COF further reveals the presence of CN and C–O groups (Fig. 2b and S4). The resonance signals of CN and C-O for the COF without Ni2+ appear at 173 and 156 ppm, respectively. However, the corresponding peaks of Ni-COF shift to 171 and 158 ppm, respectively, due to the effect of Ni(ii) coordination.27,28 These results confirm the formation of Ni-COF. SEM images show that Ni-COF possesses a spherical flower-like morphology, which is composed of numerous sheets (Fig. 2c and d, S5). TEM images of Ni-COF show optically translucent features and a layered structure (Fig. 2e and f, S6). The EDS mapping images reveal that the C, N, O and Ni elements in the selected area are uniformly distributed (Fig. 2g). The XPS survey of Ni-COF also confirms the presence of C, N, O and Ni. The signals at 399 and 532 eV correspond to N 1s and O 1s, respectively.29 The Ni 2p spectrum exhibits two main peaks around 856.1 and 873.6 eV which are assigned to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, together with their corresponding satellites around 861.3 and 880.1 eV, respectively (Fig. S7).30,31

The N2 sorption isotherm of Ni-COF is a type I isotherm with a sharp N2 uptake at low relative pressures (P/P0 &lt; 0.01), which indicates its microporous nature (Fig. 2h, S8 and S9).32 The BET surface area of Ni-COF was calculated to be 362 m2 g−1. The pore size distribution was computed by using nonlocal density functional theory. The pore size distribution was concentrated at 1–1.6 nm, which is consistent with the simulated pore diameter.
To explore the effect of Ni(ii) on electrical conductivity, a COF without Ni2+ (Ni0-COF) was synthesized for comparison (Fig. S10–S16). The electrical conductivity of Ni-COF powder was measured to be 1.3 × 10−2 S cm−1, which is more than 1500 times that of Ni0-COF (8.4 × 10−6 S cm−1). To further study the electrical conductivity of Ni-COF, a thin film was prepared on a quartz substrate and its electrical conductivity was measured by the van der Pauw method.33 The electrical conductivity of Ni-COF increases linearly with temperature, which shows a high electrical conductivity of 1.2 S cm−1 at room temperature with a semiconducting nature (Fig. 2i). The electric conductivity of Ni-COF is superior to that of most of the reported COFs and COF composites, such as PEDOT@AQ-COF (1.1 S cm−1),14 TThPP films (2.38 × 10−6 S cm−1),16 ICOFs (7.2 × 10−3 S cm−1),17 PyVg-COF (4 × 10−3 S cm−1),18 Li+@TPB-BMTP-COF (5.49 × 10−4 S cm−1)19 and TpPa-SO3Li (2.7 × 10−5 S cm−1).20 The high electrical conductivity can be attributed to the strong π-conjugation and square-planar Ni(ii) coordination.
The capacitive properties of the 2D conductive Ni-COF were firstly evaluated in a three-electrode system in 3 M KOH. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the Ni-COF electrode at different scan rates in the potential range of 0–0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO are presented in Fig. 3a. The CV curves demonstrate a pair of strong redox peaks, indicating that the energy storage and conversion are dominated by redox reactions. The shape of the CV curves is well maintained as the scan rate increased from 5 to 30 mV s−1, indicating fast charge transfer kinetics. Fig. 3b presents the galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) curves of the Ni-COF electrode at various current densities. The arch GCD profiles are in agreement with the CV analysis that Ni-COF is pseudo-capacitive. The capacitances were calculated to be 1478, 1257, 1054, 928, 860 and 711 F g−1 at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 A g−1, respectively (Fig. S17 and 3c). To preclude the impact of the Ni foam substrate on the capacitance, its electrochemical properties were evaluated (Fig. S18). The experimental results suggested that the contribution from the Ni foam substrate (48 F g−1) to the total capacity is negligible. The capacitances of Ni-COF at 0.5 and 1 A g−1 are much higher than those of Ni0-COF (204 and 184 F g−1, respectively), again confirming the importance of the square-planar Ni(ii) coordination (Fig. 3c and d, S19, S20). The capacitance of Ni-COF is superior to that of previously reported COF electrode materials, DAAQ-TFP COF (49 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1),34 [TEMPO]100%-NiP-COF (167 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1),35 DqTp-COF (154 F g−1 at 1.56 mA cm−2),36 TpOMe-DAQ (169 F g−1 at 3.3 mA cm−2),37 PEDOT-modified DAAQ-TFP-COF (197 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1),15 TaPa-Py-COF (209 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1),38 TpPa-(OH)2 (416 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1),39 and TDFP-1 (418 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1).40 The specific capacitance of Ni-COF is also comparable to that of COF composites and high-performance MOFs, such as PEDOT@AQ-COF (1663 F g−1 at 1 A g−1)14 and Co-LMOF (2474 F g−1 at 1 A g−1).41

(f) Comparison of Nyquist plots of Ni-COF and Ni0-COF.
The stability test of the Ni-COF electrode was performed at 1 A g−1. It demonstrates high stability with a high capacitance retention of 94% after 10 000 cycles (Fig. 3e). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out. According to the Nyquist plots (Fig. 3f), the Ni-COF electrode displays lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) and equivalent series resistance (Rs) than Ni0-COF. Rct and Rs are indicated by the diameter of the semicircle and the X-intercept of the Nyquist plot. This confirms the high electrical conductivity of Ni-COF. The slope of the linear part of the Nyquist plot of Ni-COF is larger than that of Ni0-COF, indicative of faster ion transport at the electrolyte/Ni-COF interfaces.
To evaluate the practical electrochemical performance, an asymmetric supercapacitor was made with activated carbon (AC) and Ni-COF. As shown by the CV curves in Fig. 4a and GCD profiles in Fig. 4b, the working potential window of the AC//Ni-COF supercapacitor can reach as large as 1.5 V. The rate capability of the AC//Ni-COF supercapacitor was firstly evaluated using CV measurements by varying the scan rate (Fig. 4c). The well-maintained shape of the CV curves suggests its good rate capability. Then GCD measurements were carried out at varied current densities from 1 to 10 A g−1 (Fig. 4d). The specific capacitances were calculated to be 417, 347, 305, 256 and 212 F g−1 at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 A g−1, respectively. The capacitance at 10 A g−1 reached 50% of the value at 1 A g−1, confirming its good rate performance (Fig. 4e). The energy density and power density of the AC//Ni-COF supercapacitor were presented in a Ragone plot (Fig. 4f). The energy density reaches 130 W h kg−1 at a power density of 839 W kg−1, which outperforms that of previously reported COF-based electrode materials and is also comparable to that of MOF-based electrode materials, such as TThPP (62.44 W h kg−1 at 70.04 W kg−1),16 TaPa-Py-COF (9.06 W h kg−1 at 100 W kg−1),38 TpPa-(OH)2 (29 W h kg−1 at 1956 W kg−1),39 TDFP-1 (58 W h kg−1 at 247 W kg−1),40 NiCo-MOF (49.4 W h kg−1 at 562.5 W h kg−1)42 and GM-LEG@Ni-MOF (32.7 W h kg−1 at 750 W kg−1).43

The possible energy storage/conversion mechanism is proposed in Scheme 1. Upon charging, hydroquinone is transformed into benzoquinone, which results in two-electron transfer (Scheme 1a).44 The presence of Ni(ii) favours the hydroquinone to benzoquinone transformation. Coupled with the 2D highly conjugated planar structure, the high electrical conductivity of Ni-COF helps the electron transport throughout each 2D planar layer (Scheme 1b).

In summary, by incorporating Ni2+ into COF frameworks, a 2D highly conjugated semiconducting Ni-COF has been synthesized as an advanced electrode material for supercapacitors. Ni-COF shows a high specific capacitance of 1257 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent cycling stability with 94% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles and an outstanding energy density of 130 W h kg−1 at a power density of 839 W kg−1. The high electrochemical performance can be mainly ascribed to the highly enhanced electrical conductivity, conjugated planar structure, and high-density redox-active centres. This work paves the way to improve the energy storage capacity of functional COFs in supercapacitors.
