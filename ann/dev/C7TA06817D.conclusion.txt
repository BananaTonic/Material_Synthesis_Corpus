4.Conclusions
Strontium-doped double perovskites (GdBa1−xSrxCo2O6−δ) possess improved oxygen evolution catalytic performance and higher electrical conductivity compared to undoped GdBaCo2O6−δ. XRD measurements together with Rietveld analysis showed that materials with higher Sr dopant content crystallised with higher symmetry, transforming from orthorhombic Pmmm with doubling in b and c (GBCO and GB9S1CO), transiting to the same Pmmm space group with doubling only in c (GB8S2CO and GB7S3CO) and finally to tetragonal P4/mmm (GB6S4CO and GB5S5CO). This transformation was accompanied by oxygen uptake, lowering the oxygen vacancy content. A combination of higher oxygen concentration, higher Co oxidation state and higher carrier bandwidth (which depends on the Co–O–Co buckling angles and Co–O bond lengths) explains the higher electronic conductivity. The surface enrichment of Ba and Sr, which are mainly in the form of hydroxides, was observed by LEIS and XPS. However, this does not make the surface inactive as shown by higher oxygen evolution current density observed with higher Sr dopant level. Hence, a thorough understanding of the crystallographic occupancy ordering and surface characteristics is essential for optimising the electrical conductivity, ionic mobility and catalytic performance, critical to designing efficient devices.
