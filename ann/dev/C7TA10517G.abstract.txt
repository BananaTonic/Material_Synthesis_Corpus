Li0.33La0.557TiO3 ceramic nanofiber-enhanced polyethylene oxide-based composite polymer electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium batteriesElectronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c7ta10517g
A polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based composite solid polymer electrolyte filled with one-dimensional (1D) ceramic Li0.33La0.557TiO3 (LLTO) nanofibers was designed and prepared. It exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 2.4 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature and a large electrochemical stability window of up to 5.0 V vs. Li/Li+, and is a promising electrolyte candidate for all solid-state lithium batteries.
