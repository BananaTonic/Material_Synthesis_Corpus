4.Conclusions
Taking ITOH as a precursor, the fabrication of nanoparticle layers via multiple spin-coating of a stable additive-free hydroxide ink is demonstrated. Surface modification with ETA on a spin-coated nanoparticle layer can promote the phase transformation of hydroxide into the crystalline ITO phase, which results in an earlier onset of crystallization and larger crystal size after the same annealing. The ETA modification also results in fewer hydroxyl groups after the annealing process, thus yielding a higher charge carrier concentration and dc conductivity two times higher than that of the non-treated layer. A conductivity of 43 S cmâˆ’1 combined with an optical transmittance above 90% is demonstrated for an ITO layer processed from a dispersion of hydroxide nanoparticles.
