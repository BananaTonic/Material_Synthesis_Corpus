Conclusion
In summary, we used the first-principles calculations based on DFT to demonstrate a kesterite-structured LCPS material and its Li ion transport behavior. The feasibility of the experimental synthesis of the LCPS material was estimated using the DFT calculated phase diagram and phonon dispersion spectrum. The electrochemical stability calculations based on the HSE06 calculated density of electron states and Li grand-potential phase diagrams indicate that the LCPS material is thermodynamically not stable at very high or low lithium chemical potentials, but it is possible to form electronically insulating but ionically conducting interphases, preventing the LCPS material from being further reduced or oxidized by passivating the surface and hence enhancing its electrochemical stability to a certain extent due to the limited kinetics. Based on the inspiring results from the nudged elastic band calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we characterized the LCPS material as a superionic conductor, which exhibits a much higher ionic conductivity of 84.9 mS cmâˆ’1 at 300 K than most solid-state electrolyte materials, such as Li10GeP2S12 and Li3PS4, due to its lower Li ion binding and the energy compensation when forming Li vacancies from the variable valence state of Cu+ cations. Our calculations demonstrate that the LCPS superionic conductor is quite promising for experimental synthesis and use as a solid-state electrolyte material for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries. We first identified an alternative design principle for fabricating new lithium, sodium and also multivalent ion superionic conductors with Li tetrahedral occupation by reducing the electronegativity difference between the anion element and non-lithium cation elements.
