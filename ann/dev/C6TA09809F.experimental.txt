Preparation of the solid electrolyte
The variation of formation energies of doped-Na3PS4 are plotted in Fig. 3, and the dissociation products are listed in Table 2, also showing for comparison data for homovalently (M = As) and trivalently (M = Al) doped samples. The stability of tetravalently doped Na3PS4 with varying dopant ion M decreases in the sequence Ge &gt; Si &gt; Ti ∼ Sn. The formation energy, and particularly the influence of different dopants on it, harmonises with literature DFT results,25 where such values are available. The slight difference in absolute values may be due to different computational settings and different sets of reference compounds. It may be noted that the stable dissociation products Na4MS4 for the different dopants M do not refer to the same structure type: Na4GeS4 and Na4SnS4 refer to the tetragonal Na4SnS4 structure type (space group P4̄21c),76 while Na4SiS4 and Na4TiS4 refer to the orthorhombic Na4GeSe4 structure type (space group Pnma).77 Given our experimental results of successfully doping 10% Ge, Sn and Ti, it may be concluded that the minor difference in dissociation energies (at 0 K) due to the choice of M is insignificant at the synthesis temperature. The dissociation energy of the 6.25% Al doped sample is comparable to the dissociation energy of the 12.5% tetravalently doped samples.

The dissociation energies corresponding to a doping concentration of 1.56% X are comparable to those of doping 6.25% M. It may be noted that the dissociation products include elemental sulphur, which may undesirably react with the electrode materials.
As seen in Fig. 4 any tetravalent doping increases the volume because additional Na is inserted into the structure. For the same dopant concentration, the volume increases in the sequence Si &lt; Ge &lt; Ti &lt; Sn in line with the atomic radii of the dopants. The extrapolation of linear trend lines of the volume vs. dopant concentration correlation with the undoped case leads to volumes close to those of the cubic phase although the energy-minimised supercells of the doped phases are inevitably slightly distorted variants of the cubic phase.

Characterisation of the solid electrolyte
Fig. 5 shows the Rietveld refinement of Na3PS4 prepared by ball milling and subsequent annealing under an argon atmosphere at 250 °C. The pattern indicates the formation of the cubic phase of Na3PS4 (space group I4̄3m) with lattice parameter a = 6.9781(1) Å at room temperature. Fig. 6 compares the temperature dependence of the cubic lattice parameter a obtained from Rietveld refinements of in situ X-ray diffraction data for the undoped, Ge- and Sn-doped samples during stepwise heating under vacuum with a heating rate of 3 K min−1. The average coefficient of thermal expansion of c-Na3PS4 over the range from room temperature to 250 °C is found to be 4.5 × 10−5 K−1. Both samples annealed at 350 °C and 500 °C under an argon atmosphere lead to the tetragonal phase. For the case of the sample annealed at 500 °C we find lattice constants a = 6.9676(1) Å, c = 7.0832(2) Å according to the Rietveld refinement shown in Fig. S2.

When partially replacing phosphorus with Ge in Na3.1Ge0.1P0.9S4, just ball milling will not lead to a cubic phase but to the tetragonal phase. The Rietveld refinement of a powder pattern for a Na3.1Ge0.1P0.9S4 sample annealed at 250 °C is shown in Fig. 7 (data collected at 200 °C), which demonstrates that the sample is stable at least up to 200 °C. The lattice parameters at room temperature for this compound are a = 6.9950(5) Å, c = 7.031(1) Å. The ratio between lattice parameters a and c is 0.99 indicating that the compound is pseudo-cubic. The compounds Na3.1Sn0.1P0.9S4 and Na3.1Ti0.1P0.9S4 with Sn and Ti dopants formed cubic phases with room temperature lattice parameters of 7.0088(3) Å and 6.9894(3) Å, respectively. Rietveld refinements of Na3.1M0.1P0.9S4 for M = Ge, Si, Sn are shown in Fig. S3–S5. From Rietveld refinements over 6 temperatures in the range between room temperature and 250 °C the coefficients of thermal expansion were determined to be 4.08 × 10−5 K−1 for Na3.1Ge0.1P0.9S4 and 4.11 × 10−5 K−1 for Na3.1Sn0.1P0.9S4. The variation of lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients appears plausible based on the different sizes of the dopant ions.

The body-centred cubic arrangement of PS43− groups in the cubic phase of Na3PS4 (space group I4̄3m) creates two distinct Na site types: the 6b site Na(1) with the partial occupancy of 0.8 that has a distorted octahedral coordination by 6 PS43− groups (or 4 + 4 coordination if the individual S2− are considered as the counterions), and the 12d site Na(2) with partial occupancy of 0.1 and a tetrahedral coordination by 4PS43− groups (or 4S2− at a distance of only 2.07 Å). For the average structure the Na(2) site is somewhat overbonded with a bond valence sum of 1.27 explaining why the “octahedral” Na(1) site is preferred. The tetragonal room temperature phase is a just slightly distorted variant of this cubic structure (not a heavily distorted fcc structure as was suggested in the original structural determination26), where the distortion allows increase of the average Na–Na distance from 3.498 Å to 3.527 Å by the coordinated displacement of 4 of the 6 Na per unit cell from the fully occupied octahedral site towards the tetrahedral site.
Our bond valence site energy models of Na+ ion migration paths in the average structure of the disordered cubic Na3PS4 (see Fig. 8a and b) phase show that “octahedral” Na(1) site is the only equilibrium site and the reported “Na(2)” site is just the saddlepoint along the Na(1)–Na(2)–Na(1) path. Thus the description of Na distribution in the cubic phase by Na(1) and Na(2) should be rather seen as an approximation to a large energy minimum that extends from the central Na(1) towards four surrounding Na(2) and is large enough to temporarily host more than one Na+ ion. If there is only one Na, then it will be predominantly located at the Na(1) site, while the presence of a second Na requires both of them to be displaced towards two of the Na(2) sites at opposite ends of the minimum, where they will have a higher site energy and therefore be considerably more mobile. This implies that for this structure subvalent doping on the P site (and consequentially an uptake of additional Na+) will be a more promising doping strategy than the creation of vacancies by supervalent doping, as it leads to lower effective migration barriers between the overcrowded extended Na sites.
Crystal structures of (a and b) the cubic phase and (c and d) the tetragonal phase of Na3PS4 projected on the a–c plane (green spheres: P, yellow spheres: sulphur, red (magenta) spheres: Na(2) (Na(1)) in the tetragonal phase; Na(1) in the cubic phase, blue crosses: Na(2) “sites” in the cubic phase that turn out to be saddlepoints). The superimposed isosurfaces in graphs (b and d) indicate bond-valence models of Na+ ion migration pathways of lowest activation energy. Red isosurfaces mark the plate-shaped space that is explored by Na while vibrating on the equilibrium site, the orange isosurface indicates the percolating pathways of lowest energy, which is 2D in the a–b plane for the tetragonal phase and 3D for the cubic phase. For the tetragonal phase the yellow isosurface in graph (d) shows the additional links perpendicular to the c-direction that allow for a 3D migration for Na+ with a migration barrier of ca. 0.45 eV. (e) Migration barriers in tetragonal (black) and cubic (red) Na3PS4 as determined from the bond valence site energy model.
In the tetragonal phase (Fig. 8c and d) that differs from the cubic phase mostly by the Na+ ordering into well-defined sites that can host only one ion, Na+ transport occurs via direct hops among the two nominally fully occupied equilibrium sites (an octahedral Na(2) site and a Na(1) site that is shifted from the octahedral site by ca. 0.6 Å towards one of the tetrahedral sites). Both sites correspond to the octahedral Na(1) site of the cubic phase. Thus, the achievable ionic conductivity will again crucially depend on the presence of vacancies or interstitials. Moreover, the relaxation of the immobile substructure in response to the Na+ ordering restricts the low energy paths for Na+ motion to the a–b plane with a substantially higher energy barrier for the motion along the c direction.
To gain a deeper insight into the ion transport in doped and undoped Na3PS4, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of the cubic phase Na392P120Si8S512 (with the same 6% Si doping proposed by Hayashi et al.) and the tetragonal phase Na384P128S512 over the temperature range 300–450 K. Fig. 9 compares the results of these simulations to experimental literature conductivity data of the same phases.22,50 The simulated conductivity of the tetragonal phase agrees both in absolute value and activation energy 0.42 eV with the available experimental data. In the fully ordered tetragonal phase the observed activation energy not only contains the migration energy (cf.Fig. 8e) but also a defect formation contribution. In contrast the activation energy observed for the Si-doped cubic phase (0.27 eV) closely matches both the experimental value and the one predicted in Fig. 7e from the static bond valence models. It should also be noted that the Arrhenius plot for the cubic phase is slightly curved so that the exact activation energy will exhibit a minor temperature dependence. The absolute value of the simulated conductivity exceeds the experimentally observed value by a factor of two, which may either be traced back to an inaccuracy of our softBV forcefield parameters or suggest that the experimental sample by Hayashi et al.13,18 does not have the exact same structure. The latter case might, e.g., involve incomplete crystallinity of the glass ceramic, as the more recent set of experimental data (for a rather limited temperature range) by Tanibata et al.19 from the same group perfectly matches both in terms of conductivity and activation energy.

When the tetragonal distortion is suppressed by enforcing the lattice parameters of the cubic phase while maintaining the stoichiometric composition, the simulated ionic conductivity remains practically unchanged at the low values of the tetragonal phase. This clarifies that the excess Na+ in the doped phase is crucial to enhance the conductivity and casts some doubts on whether in a study reporting an enhanced conductivity of Na3PS4 by optimized heat treatment of glass ceramics (as well as in the nominally stoichiometric samples produced in this work) unintentional doping may have been overlooked.45
As the volume change on doping shown in Fig. 10 should lead to a corresponding increase in free volume for the Na+ ion mobility, bond valence models yield a slight decrease of the migration barriers in the order undoped phase &gt; Si- &gt; Ge- &gt; Ti- &gt; Sn-doped phase. These bond valence migration barriers do not yet factor in the effect of Na concentration on the effective barriers of undoped and tetravalently doped phases. To achieve a deeper insight into the influence of the Na site overcrowding on the ion transport we calculated the Na site energies in pure and doped Na3PS4 applying our softBV forcefield to the DFT-optimized structures. Here, the site energy is defined as the interaction energy of an individual Na with the remaining structure including the other Na. We first verified that site energies in the t-Na3PS4 are lower than those of the majority sites in c-Na3PS4, consistent with the fact that t-Na3PS4 is more stable and has a fully ordered Na arrangement. As seen in Fig. 8 the average site energies of Na in all doped-Na3PS4 phases are higher than in both undoped cases, because more Na ions cause larger repulsion that is not fully compensated by the increase in unit cell volume. Thus the empirical simulations show that the average site energies of the Na ions decrease in the order Sn &gt; Ti &gt; Ge &gt; Si, which matches the trend of decreasing dopant ion size. In other words, the larger the dopant ion is, the more the overcrowding of Na sites is that raises the Na site energy, which has the beneficial side effect of lowering the effective migration barrier for interstitialcy-like motion, while (as seen above) it will also tend to slightly destabilize the doped phases. Hence, from our calculations Sn-doping appeared particularly promising.
Site energies of Na ions in undoped Na3PS4 and doped Na3+xMxP1−xS4 (M = Si, Ge, Ti, Sn; x = 0.0625), as calculated by the bond valence site energy approach for DFT optimised structure models. The site energies are listed relative to the most stable state (Na(1) in t-Na3PS4) as the reference point.
A DFT calculation of the band structures of Na3PS4 as well as of the isostructural Na3PSe4 (cf. ESI Fig. S6 and S7) suggests that the band gap of Na3PS4 (&gt;2 eV in the standard DFT approximation, which due to the systematic underestimation of bandgaps by DFT should translate to roughly 4 eV) is large enough to allow for its use as an electrolyte, while for Na3PSe4 (ref. 26 and 79) the band gap (ca. 1 eV in the DFT approximation) may be too low and hence electronic conductivity too high for practical applications as a solid electrolyte.
Doping
Predictions about the influence of doping on ionic conductivity are verified experimentally by impedance spectroscopy. A series of impedance plots of Na3.1Ge0.1P0.9S4 at different temperatures is shown in Fig. 11 as an example. As seen from the summary of the observed room temperature sodium ionic conductivities in Table 3, all three experimentally investigated dopants enhance the ionic conductivity and the highest conductivity is found for Sn doping. While this is qualitatively consistent with the theoretical prediction in this work as well as by Zhu et al.,25 the extent of the differences between the different dopants is only minor. SEM images of all the studied solid electrolytes in Fig. 12 show that all samples consisted of micron-sized agglomerated particles.

Preparation and characterization of electrodes
The cathode material Na2+2δFe2−δ(SO4)3 forms an alluaudite-type structure in the space group C2/c with lattice constants a = 12.654(1) Å, b = 12.761(9) Å, c = 6.503(5)Å, β = 115.52(1)° close to previously reported values for δ = 0.12 (see Fig. 13), the secondary phase observed is about 4% β-FeSO4 and possibly further amorphous impurities. The refined site occupancy of the Fe site accords with δ ≈ 0.1 though with a large error margin.

The temperature dependence of the lattice parameters as determined from Rietveld refinements of in situ XRD powder patterns is shown in Fig. 14. The coefficient of thermal expansions of lattice parameters are αa = 2.8 × 10−5 K−1, αb = 2.0 × 10−5 K−1, αc = 1.0 × 10−5 K−1, respectively, in accordance with a previous report.37 Moreover the change in thermal expansion above 350 °C may indicate structural changes that lead to thermal decomposition above 450 °C.

Thus all components of the envisaged all-solid-state battery remain (kinetically) stable between room temperature and at least 250 °C and show only moderate volume changes of 1–3% over this temperature range (comparable to the volume changes of insertion type active materials during cycling), so that it appears feasible to operate the envisaged all-solid-state battery over this entire temperature range.
Full cell performance test
Fig. 17 shows selected charge discharge cycles of the all-solid-state Na2+2δFe2−δ(SO4)3|Na3.1Sn0.1P0.9S4|Na2Ti3O7 battery cycled between 1.5 and 4.0 V at room temperate or 80 °C with currents corresponding to rates of 0.1 or 2C. Fig. 16 then displays the corresponding variation of the specific capacity with the number of cycles. When charged and discharged at 0.1C rate the first discharge capacity at room temperature reaches 113.5 mA h per g of Na2+2δFe2−δ(SO4)3 and the first charge capacity 107.5 mA h g−1 (see Fig. 16a), both close to the theoretical capacity of 113 mA h g−1 and a discharge capacity of 94 mA h g−1 is retained after the 10th cycle. When charged and discharged at a rate of 2C (Fig. 16b), still an initial discharge capacity of 84 mA h g−1 is achieved. Over the first 30 room temperature cycles with a rate of 2C the specific discharge capacity drops to 47 mA h g−1 and thereafter continues to fade to 16 mA h g−1 at the 100th cycle (see Fig. 18).

It should be mentioned that the voltage profile of the initial cycles differs slightly from those of the later cycles as also recently found by Oyama et al.39 The differential galvanostatic profiles (dQ/dV) of the Na2+2δFe2−δ(SO4)3|Na3.1Sn0.1P0.9S4|Na2Ti3O7 battery (Fig. 19) show, besides the main peak at 2.7 V vs. Na/Na+, two additional minor peaks (1.7, 2.0 V vs. Na/Na+) during the first discharge, one additional peak for the second discharge (1.7 V) and only the main peak at 2.7 V from the third discharge cycle onwards. The additional peaks in the first discharge cycles may indicate some irreversible structural transformations, but might also represent the different potentials for the removal of Na from the three distinct Na sites in Na2+2δFe2−δ(SO4)3. In contrast, the charging process consistently shows a single peak around 3.1 V only, which might suggest that the kinetics of the charging process (as well as of the later cycles of the discharge) in our all-solid state cells is controlled by the charge transfer at the interfaces of the alluaudites.

In summary, all components of the envisaged all-solid-state battery remain (kinetically) stable between room temperature and at least 250 °C and show only moderate volume changes of 1–3% over this temperature range (comparable to the volume changes of insertion type active materials during cycling), so that it appears feasible to operate the envisaged all-solid-state battery over this entire temperature range.
Fig. 16c shows that the first discharge capacity at 80 °C and a rate of 2C is 109 mA h g−1 of Na2+2δFe2−δ(SO4)3 close to the theoretical capacity (ca. 113 mA h g−1). Fig. 18 then demonstrates that 91% of the initial capacity is retained after 50 cycles, and 82% over 100 cycles.
Fig. 20 compares the current that can be drawn from the all-solid-state sodium-ion battery demonstrated in this work with the available literature all-solid-state sodium-ion full and half cell data (listed in Table 1). Therefrom it can be seen that this is the first reported full cell all-solid-state sodium-ion battery that achieves current capability comparable to those in liquid electrolyte cells at room temperature.

As for most all-solid-state cells only low rate capacity data were available, characteristic current data are consistently determined as experimental cathode capacity times C rate. For full cell data the respective operation temperatures are indicated; other data points refer to room temperature values at a rate of 2C (or the nearest C rate published).
