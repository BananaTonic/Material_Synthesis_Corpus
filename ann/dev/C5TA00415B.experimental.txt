Synthesis of monodispersed SiO2 solid spheres
Monodispersed SiO2 solid spheres about 250 nm in diameter were prepared by using a modified Stober process according to Yin's method.25 Mixture A was prepared containing 61.75 mL of ethanol, 24.75 mL of H2O, and 9.0 mL of ammonium. Then a mixture of 4.5 mL of TEOS and 45.5 mL of ethanol was immediately added into mixture A. After the reaction was allowed to continue at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours, a milky white suspension was produced and then washed in an ethanol solution several times, and dried at 80 °C for further use.
Preparation of porous PES/PVP composite membrane
PES (Mw = 534 000, Aldrich), a certain ratio of PVP (Mn = 360 000, IPS Technologies), and SiO2 spheres were dispersed in 10 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, reagent grade, Aldrich) and stirred for 1 day at RT. Then the as prepared polymer solution was cast on a flat framed glass and heated at 70 °C over 12 hours. Further, the SiO2 containing PES/PVP composite membrane was peeled off from the glass substrate and immersed into a HF solution for 1 week to remove the SiO2 spheres from the membrane, then the porous PES/PVP composite membrane was ready for further use.
Membrane characterization
The morphologies of the SiO2 spheres and the composite membranes were recorded on a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) detector (Camscan 3400, Oxford Instruments) at 20 kV accelerating voltage. To view the cross section of the PES/PVP membrane, all samples were ruptured in liquid nitrogen, followed by the sputtering of gold onto the cross section and surface of the membranes.
Determination of the porosity
The porosity of the as prepared submicro-pore containing PES/PVP was evaluated by the water absorbency.26,27 The formula is shown below:Wdry and Wwet are the membrane weights before and after immersion in water. Vdry is the volume of the membrane in the dry state. ρwater is the density of DI water. To determine the weight of the composite membrane in the wet state, the water absorption of the membrane itself has been deducted.
PA doping treatment
The PES/PVP composite membranes were immersed into an 85 wt% PA solution at RT for 24 h, and then wiped with filter papers. The weighting was estimated based on the difference in the membrane after and before the PA doping process. The PA doping level is defined as the amount of PA absorbed by the monomer unit of PVP. The formula is shown below:WA and WB are the membrane weights after and before the PA doping treatment. α is the content of PVP in the composite membrane. For each PA doping level reported, at least four samples were measured and the results were taken as the average.
Proton conductivity
The proton conductivity of the as prepared membranes was measured in a single cell via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy over a frequency range of 100 Hz to 1000 kHz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV using an IviumStat electrochemical workstation. The membranes were sandwiched into membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), and the measurements were carried out under dry H2 and O2 in a temperature range from 140 °C to 180 °C. Four different samples were used for the measurement and the conductivity values were taken as the average.
Single cell performance and durability test
The PES/PVP composite membranes were used to assemble MEAs. Pt/C with a Pt loading of 0.5 mg cm−2 was used as both the anode and cathode. Catalyst inks were prepared by blending the Pt/C powders and PVP solution (5 wt%, ethanol) under ultrasonic vibration. Then the catalyst ink was brushed onto the microporous gas diffusion layer (GDL) to prepare the electrodes, and dried at 45 °C. The membrane was sandwiched between two electrodes to obtain a MEA with hot pressing. The performances of a single fuel cell were tested at a temperature range of 120–180 °C by a fuel cell testing station G20 (Greenlight, Canada). Dry H2 and O2 were input with flow rates of 150 mL min−1. The continuous durability test was performed at a constant loading current of 0.2 A cm−2 at 150 °C.
