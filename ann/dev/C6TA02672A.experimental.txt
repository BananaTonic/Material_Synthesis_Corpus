Powders of SrVO3−δ and Sr0.8Ln0.2V1−yNbyO3−δ (Ln = La and Y; y = 0–0.1) were prepared by conventional solid state reaction route using SrCO3 (≥99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), La2O3 (≥99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), Y2O3 (≥99.9%, H. C. Starck), V2O5 (≥99%, Fluka) and Nb2O5 (&gt;99.9%. Alfa Aesar) as starting reagents. Prior to weighing, niobium and rare-earth oxides were calcined in air to remove the adsorbates. Weighed and mixed components were pre-reacted in air at 500 °C and 600 °C for 5 h at each temperature with intermediate regrinding. Subsequently, the mixtures were fired at 900 °C (3 × 5 h, with repeated regrinding) in a flowing 10% H2–N2 atmosphere and then subjected to high-energy milling (Retsch PM 100 planetary ball milling, 650 rpm, 3 h, nylon containers with Tosoh tetragonal zirconia milling media) to promote homogenization. After milling, the powders were compacted uniaxially at ∼40 MPa into disk-shaped samples and sintered at 1500 °C in a 10% H2–N2 atmosphere for 10 h. Sintering was performed using alumina plates as supports, with an interlayer of powder, with an identical cation composition to avoid possible interactions between support and samples.
Sintered ceramic samples were cut into rectangular bars and polished for dilatometric and electrical measurements (mean dimensions 1.8 mm × 3.3 mm × 13 mm). The density of ceramics was calculated from the mass and geometric dimensions of the samples. Powdered samples for X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermal analysis were prepared by grinding the sintered ceramics in a mortar. Before collecting the XRD data, the as-prepared powdered samples were heated in flowing 10% H2–N2 to 1000 °C and then cooled slowly to achieve an equilibrium state.
The XRD patterns were obtained at room temperature using a PANalytical X'Pert PRO diffractometer (CuKα radiation). The unit cell parameters were calculated using Fullprof software (profile match method). Microstructural characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU-70 instrument) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, Bruker Quantax 400 detector). The dilatometric measurements (vertical Linseis L70/2001 instrument) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Setaram SetSys 16/18 instrument, sensitivity 0.4 μg, initial sample weight ∼0.5 g) were carried out in flowing air, argon or 10% H2–N2 mixture between room temperature and 1000 °C at a constant heating-cooling rate of 2–3 °C min−1 or isothermally as a function of time.
The electrical conductivity was studied as a function of temperature and oxygen partial pressure using a 4-probe DC technique under reducing conditions set by controlled H2–H2O–N2 mixtures. Variations of the sample resistance in the redox cycles were recorded using impedance spectroscopy (Agilent 4284A precision LCR meter) with automatic data acquisition.
In all cases (synthesis/sintering and measurements), oxygen partial pressure p(O2) in a gas atmosphere was monitored using yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) solid-electrolyte sensors. Representative p(O2) values in Ar and 10% H2–N2 atmospheres corresponded to ∼5 × 10−5 atm and ∼10−20 atm at 900 °C, respectively.
