Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of PEDOT:PSS composites could be tuned by controlling the hybrid composition of carbon materials during in situ polymerization of PEDOT:PSS. A thorough analysis of the polymer/carbon composites was performed by using SEM, TEM, FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS, as well as electrical and thermoelectric measurements. We found that the conducting polymers and carbon materials with a low-dimensionality have strong electronic interactions that result in better electrical bridging between conductive domains. We also found that the synergic effects between PEDOT:PSS and carbon materials improve significantly when carbons with different dimensionalities, namely multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene platelets, are simultaneously incorporated, as the advantageous properties of both materials can be utilized. As a result, the hybrid composites of PEDOT:PSS, graphene, and MWCNTs with 5 wt% carbon content showed a higher electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and thermoelectric figure of merit as compared to the pristine PEDOT:PSS and composites of PEDOT:PSS and the single-type carbon material. These results emphasize the potential of in situ polymerization and hybridization of conducting polymers with multiple low-dimensional materials for the development of polymer-based energy devices such as thermoelectric modules, organic photovoltaic cells, and supercapacitors.
