Results
The CNF membranes were manufactured from an aqueous suspension of nanofibers characterized by high aspect ratio with a length of ≈300 nm and height of ≈2 nm (see ESI Fig. S1). Moreover, the CNF are characterized by high stability in acid conditions up to 30 °C (see ESI). This was also studied in detail by Fujisawa et al. on celluronic acid obtained by TEMPO mediated oxidized cellulose at pH 10.30 The water uptake and conductivity as a function of relative humidity of CNF membranes consisting of nanofibers with a surface charge density of 600 and 1550 μmol g−1 (CNF-600 and CNF-1550, respectively) is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1A shows the water uptake of the CNF-600 and CNF-1550 membranes before and after ion exchange (see also Table S1 ESI).

The water uptake for the CNF–COOH increases about one order of magnitude from 55 to 95% RH, while for the CNF–COONa ones increases two orders of magnitude. At 95% RH the water uptake of CNF–COONa is approximately 5× larger than that of CNF–COOH. The CNF membranes with higher surface charge density (1550 μmol g−1) have higher water uptake compared to the ones with lower (600 μmol g−1), in agreement with earlier reports.17,29 The carboxylic groups have a lower hydration shell than the carboxylated groups thus reducing the water uptake which further translates in lower swelling and higher dimensional stability. Moreover, in CNF–COOH, due to the hydrogen bond and absence of electrostatic repulsions, the attractive interactions between cellulose nanofibers is stronger, which results in a higher Young's modulus.31
The in situ conductivity of a number of samples was measured as a function of RH, from 95 to 55% and the results are shown in Fig. 1B. Note that the discrepancy in absolute values for the proton conductivity in Nafion measured in this work and the values in the literature is likely related to MEA preparation and internal resistances within the cell housing.
At 95% RH, the conductivity of H-CNF-1550 is ≈2 mS cm−1, two orders of magnitude larger than the highest values previously reported for nanocellulose-based membranes.23 However, the conductivity of H-CNF-1550 membranes is still 10–50× lower than that of Nafion 212, both in control experiments and literature data, respectively.10 The conductivity of H-CNF-1550 is constant above 65%, but drops significantly at 55% RH, whereas the conductivity of Nafion decreases exponentially with decreasing RH. The results shown in Fig. 1B indicate that the in situ conductivity of CNF membranes is far less sensitive to humidity changes than Nafion, probably due to the higher hydrophilic character of CNF compared to Nafion. For this reason, CNF membranes can absorb much more water compared to Nafion and thus the CNF membrane may have a conductivity less sensitive to lowered relative humidity. Namely, the water content λ,32,33 represented by the number of water molecules per proton conductive site in both CNF 600 and 1550 (Fig. S2), is &gt;100× higher than that of Nafion 212.10
The proton conductivity of the CNF membranes was also measured for membranes with different thicknesses, t, and surface charge densities.

The conductivity is observed to be independent of the membranes thickness, indicating that the membranes have a homogenous internal structure. The large conductivity observed in Nafion is ascribed to the large amount and the high acidity of the sulfonic group (pKa ≈ −6)34 as well as the presence of confined water channels between its hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains.11 Herein, the difference between CNF and Nafion is likely due to the use of functional groups that are significantly less acidic, i.e., the pKa of carboxylic acid is ≈3–4.35 Regarding the presence of water channels in CNF membranes and overall their internal structure, we characterized the membranes with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Fig. 2A and B show SEM images of the surface and the cross-section of the H-CNF-1500 membrane, respectively. As can be seen from the images, at the surface, the nanofibers form an entangled network36 whereas the image of the cross-section shows that the CNF are arranged together in layers. This layered structure is characteristic of CNF films dried by slow evaporation of the solvent37,38 and gives the membranes barrier properties against gases such as oxygen and hydrogen.39 Thanks to the controlled slow drying, the dried CNF films are dense and transparent.

Fig. 2C and D show the evolution of CNF membrane structure upon water absorption at increasing RH as studied by SAXS. The SAXS data were fitted using a two-stage model2where A and B are scaling factors and C is a constant background. The first term to the right is a power law with a scaling exponent n, known as Porod exponent, which describes the complexity of the network. As RH increases n decreases suggesting that, in the tested RH condition, the CNF agglomerates are kept highly entangled, despite water causing swelling of the nanofiber network. Generally, an exponent 1 &lt; n &lt; 3 indicates that the network may adopt a bulk fractal dimension, whereas 2 &lt; n &lt; 3 is known as a mass fractal dimension, which is observed in most cases in this study (see ESI Table S2). The second term is a Gaussian function used to describe the average pore size Ξ in the densely packed CNF membranes. Ξ accounts for the distinct feature that appears around q ≈ 0.59 nm−1, that increases in intensity with the water content and is attributed to the formation of water channels in the pores. Indeed, due to the swelling induced by the water uptake, the size of the pores increases from ≈1.0 nm at 55–75% to ≈ 2 nm at 95% RH (see ESI Table S2), i.e., the pores are still smaller than the average diameter of CNF even at these values of water uptake (Fig. 1A). At 95% RH the CNF membranes have a pore size comparable with fully hydrated Nafion with a width of 2.5 ± 0.2 nm, as determined with electron microscope cryotomography.40 An increase of porosity during the swelling increases the scattering volume (CNF–pore) although the incorporation of water in the membrane channels reduces the scattering contrast (CNF–water interphase), which leads to an overall increase in intensity at the high q range. The higher scattering intensity of H-CNF-1500 (Fig. 2C) is associated with a larger water uptake compared to H-CNF-600 (Fig. 2D), as the amount of water depends on the type of counter ion (H+ or Na+) and on the amount of surface charge on the nanofibers (Fig. 1A). The SAXS pattern of the Na-CNF-1550 and Na-CNF-600 (SESI Fig. S3 and Table S2) shows higher intensity and a less defined feature at high q, due to the larger amount of water and larger swelling. The structural evolution of the membrane as a function of humidity suggests that the formation of the water channels in the structure happens at humidity values &gt;75%. We speculate that the already high water content ensures a good proton conductivity and that additional water does not have an important impact in the performance as opposite to what is observed for Nafion.11 At the same time, the in situ conductivity remains constant down towards 65% RH (Fig. 1B) despite the variation in water content (Fig. 1A), meaning that bound water has to contribute to the proton conduction. The interaction between water and cellulose has been extensively studied,41–43 showing that the water is present in the CNF both as absorbed and bound water. The movable bound water is located between the nanofiber agglomerate–agglomerate interface whereas the immobile portion is between nanofibers belonging to the same agglomerate.43 The absorbed water promotes the formation of channels with increased humidity (feature at high q). Intuitively, the mobility of the absorbed water is higher than the bound water, suggesting that the predominant and most favorable proton conduction mechanism in CNF membrane may occur via the hydrogen bonds present in the liquid water (Grötthuss mechanism). The fact that the in situ proton conductivity is constant as a function of RH (&gt;65% RH) is unprecedented for nanocellulose based membranes. This phenomenon is also opposite for Nafion in which the RH plays a very large role in the membrane conductivity.11 Bayer et al. show that ex situ proton conductivity in their CNF decreases approximately 2 orders of magnitude between 80 and 70% RH.23 The lower conductivity towards low RH could be attributed to the use of CNF with fiber thicknesses of tens to hundreds of nanometers with a lower amount of surface water, cf. the CNF used in this study with a thickness of ≈2 nm and a high amount of surface water (ESI Fig. S1). Recently, Jankowska et al. showed that films made of nanocellulose had higher proton conductivity compared to the ones made of larger microcellulose,24 supporting our results that highlight the importance of high aspect ratio nanofibers and well defined and homogenous membrane structures (achievable by controlled slow drying conditions). After the fuel cell evaluation, the physicochemical characterization (including SAXS, XRD and IR) show no significant alteration in their chemistry, crystallinity or microstructure (see ESI, Fig. S4 and S5).
In addition to high proton conductivity, barrier properties towards H2 and O2 is another key factor for a well-functioning PEM, which has been previously shown for CNF.39
Here, the in situ characterization of the H2 permeability, was performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and crossover current density measurements. Fig. 3A shows the cyclic voltammograms of the H-CNF membranes with 600 and 1550 μmol g−1 and Nafion 212. Both CNF and Nafion curves show similar size of the adsorption and desorption peaks for hydrogen onto the 100 and 110 facets of the Pt catalyst (peaks below 0.4 V). This indicates that the electrodes in all tests have similar amounts of catalytic sites available and that the use of CNF membranes does not affect the catalyst layer. At N2/100% H2 conditions in a fuel cell the crossover of hydrogen from the counter/reference electrode results in a typical lift of the CV for Nafion. However, both H-CNF membranes curves center around a lower current density than Nafion, which is an indication of a lower hydrogen crossover at these operating conditions, despite the CNF membranes being are significantly thinner (≈14 μm compared to 51 μm). The low hydrogen permeability is probably related to the layered structure and high density of the CNF membranes (Fig. 2A and B). The same conclusions were reached for CNF and CNC membrane prepared by vacuum filtration and hot pressing.23 The crossover current density (Fig. 3B), proportional to the hydrogen crossover, confirms the observations in the CV characterization. Nafion is characterized by the highest crossover current density and among the CNF membranes the H-CNF-600 has the lowest crossover. No significant difference between H-CNF-600 and H-CNF-1550 is observed, but a small decrease can be seen with increased membrane thickness. Calculating the permeability coefficients for the CNF membranes gives 1.5 ± 0.5 × 10−11 and 2 ± 0.5 × 10−11 mol cm−1 s−1 bar−1 for the thicker and thinner membranes respectively. The values are very close and indicate that the permeability does not change by altering the thickness. For Nafion the corresponding value in our setup and cell housing is an order of magnitude higher, i.e., 3.1 × 10−10 mol cm−1 s−1 bar−1. With increased RH, the hydrogen crossover of Nafion membranes also increases as the greater distance between polymer chains (due to the water channels) offers additional pathways for the crossover.44 In the case of the CNF membrane the opposite behavior is observed. Indeed, the Nyquist plots (Fig. S9) show that the crossover is higher at lower RH. Most probably when the absorbed water forms channels (shown by SAXS) at high humidity, once the water content inside the membrane is lowered, these channels give the additional pathways for the diffusion of gas. This hypothesis is strengthened when assessing the durability of the CNF membranes (Fig. S10). Indeed, after the RH of the cell was decreased from 95% to 85% and brought back to 95%, the OCV is lower than the initial value, indicating a larger cross-over.

The influence of the CNF surface charge density and thickness of membranes on performance was evaluated by current density–voltage measurements in a fuel cell during operation at 30 °C and 95% RH. The IR-corrected (dashed lines) and non-corrected (solid lines) polarization curves of H-CNF-1550 and H-CNF-600 membranes at different thicknesses are shown. The IR-corrected lines are compensated using the high frequency resistance, from which the conductivity was calculated, and removes any differences in resistance due to various thickness of the membranes and any other resistive losses in the cell.
All the CNF membranes have a high open circuit voltage, close to that of Nafion, which is expected from the low hydrogen crossover. In the current voltage measurements, the H-CNF-1550 membranes show a superior performance to H-CNF-600, although still having a higher resistance than Nafion. These results are in accordance with the conductivity measurements above. The higher performance of the H-CNF-1550 membranes compared to the H-CNF-600 is the result of slightly smaller dimensions, which leads to a higher water uptake and a more pronounced formation of water channels, as observed by SAXS measurements. During the durability measurement a performance loss was observed at 85% RH for the H-CNF-1550 membrane, but after increasing the RH to 95% the cell performance and conductivity were partially recovered and stable throughout the experiment (Fig. S10). As discussed, the lower conductivity and so, lower performance compared to Nafion is likely related to the lower acidity of the carboxylic groups but the interfacial resistance between electrode and membrane, and/or differences in membrane structure may play a role. However, the good crossover properties of very thin CNF membranes show promise to reduce the internal resistance of the fuel cell. Further, as the CNF films are characterized by better mechanical properties than Nafion, they could provide a robust alternative in several energy applications. For example Nafion 117 at 30% RH have Young's modulus of ≈0.2 GPa,45 whereas Na-CNF films show ≈ 15 GPa.31 However, for both CNF and Nafion films the Young's modulus decreases with an increased relative humidity. These CNF membranes are very promising for PEMFC applications, but further optimization of the MEA under varying fuel cell operating conditions is required.
