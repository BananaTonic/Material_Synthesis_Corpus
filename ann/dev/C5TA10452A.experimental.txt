Preparation of MIL-101
MIL-101 is synthesized via a hydrothermal method. 4.000 g chromium(iii) nitrate nonahydrate and 1.667 g terephthalic acid were dispersed in 48 mL water. This solution was contained in a hydrothermal synthesis reactor maintained at 220 °C for 8 h, and then a turbid liquid was obtained. MIL-101 was centrifuged from that turbid liquid and washed with DMF to remove residual unreacted terephthalic acid and chromium(iii) nitrate, and the product was designated as crude-MIL.
Purification of MIL-101
Crude-MIL was stewed in DMF at 100 °C for a week to remove the residual terephthalic acid trapped in the MIL-101 cages, and the DMF was replaced every 12 h. The crude-MIL was successively treated with ethanol and dichloromethane for 2 days under reflux to gradually replace the high boiling point solvents. The product was named as purified-MIL.
Entrapment of PIL
Poly N-vinylimidazolium (ionic liquid) (PIL) was entrapped in MIL-101 by a “ship in a bottle” method. Purified-MIL was degassed in a Schlenk tube at 120 °C under vacuum for 2 days. Meanwhile, the PIL precursors N-vinylimidazole and vinylbenzylchloride were mixed in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 at −20 °C. After the degasification procedure, the Schlenk tube was cooled to −20 °C, and the mixture of PIL precursors was added to it under vacuum. The pressure in the Schlenk tube was allowed to increase to atmospheric pressure, enabling the PIL precursors to be sucked into the MIL-101 cages by both capillary force and pressure difference. Purified-MIL was stirred in PIL precursors for 2 days to allow a uniform dispersion of the PIL precursors, and the product was named PIL-precursors@MIL. The PIL-precursors@MIL was separated by centrifugation, washed with 1-methylimidazole and water to remove excess PIL precursors, and made into a paste with an appropriate amount of water. The paste was treated at 60 °C for 24 h to achieve the polymerization of PIL precursors, then washed with water and dried at 40 °C under vacuum. The greyish-green powder obtained from the above steps was named PIL@MIL.
Preparation of the MOF membrane
A hydrogenated styrene–ethylene/butylene–styrene triblock copolymer (SEBS) was chosen as a binder for the fabrication of membranes due to its excellent compatibility, mechanical properties and processability. PIL@MIL was mixed with SEBS/tetrahydrofuran solution (0.01625 g mL−1), and the weight ratio between PIL@MIL and SEBS was 95 : 5. This mixture was continuously ground until all the tetrahydrofuran volatilized. The obtained powder was tiled in a mould and pressed at 100 °C under 20 MPa. After cooling down, the membrane was demolded, which was named PIL@MIL-mem. The thickness of membranes can be facilely controlled by the amount of PIL@MIL, and was ∼270 μm in this study. Purified-MIL was fabricated into the membrane using the same method, and named MIL-mem. Before testing, PIL@MIL-mem and MIL-mem were soaked in 1 M aqueous NaOH for 24 h to replace Cl− with OH−, and washed using flowing water for 2 h to remove the residual NaOH.
Preparation of the ImPEEK membrane and Nafion membrane
ImPEEK (imidazolium-functionalized PEEK) was synthesized by a two-step process. 8 g PEEK was dissolved in 480 mL concentrated sulfuric acid at −20 °C. Then, 40 mL fresh chloromethyl octyl ether was added, and this mixture was treated at −15 °C for 15 min. After pouring the mixture into excess water, white floccules of chloromethylated poly(ether ether ketone) (CmPEEK) were obtained. CmPEEK (0.65 g) was dissolved in 10 mL 1-methylimidazole, cast onto glass plates, and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h and 80 °C for another 24 h. The resulting CmPEEK membranes could react with 1-methylimidazole to form ImPEEK via the Menshutkin reaction. Before testing, ImPEEK was soaked in 1 M NaOH for 24 h to replace Cl− with OH−, and washed using flowing water for 2 h to remove the residual NaOH. Nafion® 117 membranes purchased from DuPont™ were activated before use.24
Characterization
The crystal structure of crude-MIL, purified-MIL and PIL@MIL was confirmed by high-resolution XRD operated on a Rigaku D/max2500v/Pc (Cu Kα) instrument with a two-stage scan: the first stage is in the angular range of 2.0–10.0° with a speed of 0.2° min−1; the second stage is in the angular range of 10–70° with a speed of 2° min−1.
XPS measurements were carried out using an Axis Ultra DLD XPS instrument (Kratos Analytical Ltd.) with an Al Kα radiator, and analyzed using the casaXPS (Casa® Software Ltd).
Fourier-transformed infrared (FT-IR) measurements were carried out on a Nicolet 6700 instrument with a wavelength range of 4000–400 cm−1 and resolution of 4 cm−1. Powder samples were mixed with KBr and pressed into pellets for the measurements.
A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) are used. FESEM images were obtained using a Nanosem 430 operated at 10 keV. Before the test, PIL@MIL, crude-MIL and purified-MIL were placed on conductive tapes and sputtered with gold; and PIL@MIL-mem was sputtered with gold on its cross-section.
The morphologies of MIL-101 were observed by using a HRTEM (FEI Tecnai G2 F20) equipping with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector. Samples were dispersed in ethanol and loaded onto copper grids. EDS-mappings were carried out using the energy dispersive EDX on the HRTEM.
Dynamic leakage ratio of PIL
The leakage ratio of PIL was tested in periodically replaced water at 30 °C. In order to save PIL from decomposition, PIL was converted into Cl− form and the test condition was slightly acidic. PIL@MIL (m = 1.000 g) was immersed in V (10.00 mL) deionized water for 4.5 days. Then, PIL@MIL was centrifuged and immersed in another V mL fresh deionized water again for another 4.5 days. The content of the Cl element (ωn) in the supernatant liquid was tested by ion chromatography. The aforementioned procedures were performed recurrently. The leakage ratio of PIL was calculated by the following equations (eqn (1) and (2)).12Where ωn (g mL−1) is the content of the Cl element in supernatant liquid after the nth cycle; MPIL (g mol−1), and MCl (g mol−1) are the relative molar mass of the unit of PIL and relative atomic mass of Cl, respectively; mn (g) is the mass of PIL leaking in the nth cycle; ∑ is a summation notation and is employed to calculate the total leakage of PIL after the nth cycle, ωPIL (g g−1) is the PIL content of PIL@MIL; Ln (%) is the leakage ratio of PIL after the nth cycle.
Determination of ion exchange capacity (IEC)
IECs of membranes were determined by an inverse titration method. ImPEEK or PIL@MIL-mem (with a dry mass of m = 0.100 g, in OH− form) was immersed in standard hydrochloric acid solution (V1 = 30.00 mL, a = 0.0100 mol L−1) for 24 h. Then, the solution was back titrated with standard KOH solution (V2 mL, b = 0.0025 mol L−1). The IEC of the membrane was calculated by eqn (3):3
Measurement of ion conductivity
The in-plane hydroxide conductivities of membranes (σ, S cm−1) were determined by a typical two probe AC impedance spectroscopy method using a Princeton Parstat 2273 Electrochemical System. Membrane samples which were hydrated before measurement were sandwiched in a two-point-probe cell, and heated in water to reach the given temperatures ranging from 20 to 100 °C. Data were recorded at a frequency range of 10 to 106 Hz. Hydroxide conductivity was calculated using eqn (4). Nafion was activated using the same method as in previous literature,24 and the proton conductivity of Nafion was determined in the same way as the hydroxide conductivities of ImPEEK and PIL@MIL.4Where l and A are the distance between the two electrodes and the cross-sectional area of the membrane, respectively; R is the membrane resistance obtained from the AC impedance spectrum.
