Influence of steric bulk on the oxidative stability of phenolate-based magnesium-ion battery electrolytesElectronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c5ta07479g
A compilation of electrolytes within the standard RPhOMgCl and AlCl3 in a THF electrolyte system with varying alkyl-based steric bulks about the phenol ring were prepared and cycled electrochemically. Most notably, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol-based solutions exhibited high conductivity (2.56 mS cmâˆ’1) and compatibility with the Chevrel-phase Mo6S8 intercalation cathode (over 200 h cycle time at C/10 current).
