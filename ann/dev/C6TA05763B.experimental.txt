2.1Materials synthesis
Sm and Ca co-doped ceria with different Sm contents was synthesized by a co-precipitation method. The raw materials were nitrate salts of analytical grade and used without further purification. Cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce(NO3)3·6H2O), samarium nitrate hexahydrate (Sm(NO3)2·6H2O) and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O) were mixed and dissolved in deionized water to form a 0.5 M solution. The amount of Ca ions was fixed and we adjusted the weight ratio of Sm and Ce to 10 : 90, 20 : 80, and 30 : 70. The resultant solution was heated at 80 °C through a water bath method and vigorously stirred at 800 rpm for 30 min. Then, a 0.5 M Na2CO3 solution as the precipitation agent was added dropwise into the above solution under stirring to form a white precipitate. The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water three times, followed by drying in an oven at 120 °C for 8–10 h. Finally, the dried precursors were calcined at 800 °C for 4 h to obtain yellowish and foamy powders, and then completely ground to receive homogeneous Sm and Ca co-doped CeO2 (SCDC) samples. In comparison, a single Ca2+ doped CeO2 (CDC) was also prepared using a similar procedure as described above. The samples prepared with different Sm precursor contents 0, 10 wt%, 20 wt% and 30 wt% were denoted as CDC, SCDC1, SCDC2 and SCDC3, respectively.
A series of LSCF–SCDC composites were prepared by mixing LSCF, a commercial product purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA), with the as-prepared SCDC through completely grinding in a mass ratio of 50 : 50 to get uniform mixtures, and then sintered at 600 °C for 2 h.
2.2Microstructural characterization
The crystal structures of SCDC with different Sm dopant contents were characterized using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Germany, Bruker Corporation) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54060 Å) radiation. The morphologies of the samples were analyzed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM7100F Japan) equipped with an Oxford energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS).
Electron microscopy and spectroscopy investigations were performed on a JEOL ARM 200CF microscope equipped with a cold field emission electron source, a DCOR probe corrector (CEOS GmbH), a 100 mm2 JEOL Centurio EDS detector, and a Gatan imaging filter (GIF) quantum ERS electron energy-loss spectrometer. The samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations were prepared by dispersing the LSCF–SCDC powder in ethanol via bath sonication for 15 minutes, and then drop casting onto a lacey carbon TEM grid, followed by drying in air. The microscope was operated at 200 kV; a semi-convergence angle of 20.4 mrad was employed, giving rise to a probe size of 0.8 Å (1 Å for the analytical analyses), while 90–370 mrad collection angles were used to obtain high angle annular dark field (HAADF) images. Collection semi angles of 111.5 mrad and 57.1 mrad were used to record the EELS elemental mappings and line scans, respectively.
2.3Conductivity measurements
The pellets, painted with Ag paste on both sides and then sintered at 600 °C for 30 min, were used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The measurements were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI-660D) under the open circuit voltage with a 10 mV AC signal over the frequency range of 0.1–105 Hz. The electronic conductivity of the LSCF–SCDC composites was determined by the Hebb-Wagner polarization method. Constant voltages were applied using a potentiostat on a Pt (foil)/LSCF–SCDC/Pt (foil) cell and the current as a function of time (I–t) was recorded. Polarization behavior can be observed in the initial stage of the I–t curve, i.e. the current decreases with time in a certain period; this can be attributed to the movement of O2− in the sample when the measurement begins. However, due to the O2− blocking function of the Pt foil, the mobile oxygen ions would be exhausted with time and could not contribute to the current anymore. Finally, the current reached a steady state in which the electrons were the only source charge carriers; therefore we can obtain the electronic conductivity from the stable current.19
2.4Fuel cell fabrication and performance test
The LSCF–SCDC composites were sandwiched between two pieces of Ni foam pasted with NCAL (Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05Li-oxide, a commercial product purchased from Tianjin Baomo Joint Hi-Tech venture, China) and then pressed uniaxially under a load of 200–300 MPa to form a disc type cell. The resulting cell size is 13 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm in thickness. All cells suffered from an in situ pre-heat-treatment process at 580 °C for 1 hour, and then the temperature was lowered down to 550 °C for the performance test.
The electrochemical characterization of the fuel cells was performed using a computerized instrument (ITECH8511, ITECH Electrical Co., Ltd.). Hydrogen was supplied as the fuel at a flow rate of 80–120 ml min−1, and air as the oxidant at 150 ml min−1 under 1 atm.
