Conclusions
The focus of this study was on improving the electrochemical performance of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode materials for SIBs. Partially substituting V with Mn in the NASICON framework to obtain Na3V1.9Mn0.1(PO4)3 significantly affected the electrochemical properties. As expected, Mn supported the crystal structure to improve the stability and participated in the electrochemical reaction at approximately 4 V during cycling. Moreover, the substituted Mn lowered the bandgap energy, as observed in the UV-vis spectra, and improved electron transfer compared with that for the Mn-free Na3V2(PO4)3. After carbon coating to obtain C/Na3V2−xMnx(PO4)3, the electrical conductivity of the sodium ions was dramatically increased to up to 10−3 S cm−1. As a result, the electrochemical performance of C/NVMP was significantly improved. For example, the initial discharge capacity was improved from 95 mA h g−1 for NVMP to 107.4 mA h g−1 for C/NVMP, and even at a rate of 10C, C/NVMP delivered a high discharge capacity of 78 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles. The improved material properties were confirmed by evaluating the cycle characteristics at low temperature and in a full cell. Our findings demonstrate the advantages of using doping to increase the conductivity of sodium ions for other SIB electrode materials.
