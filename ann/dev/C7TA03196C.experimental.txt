Experimental
Materials
Glycerol, DMSO and PSSNa [molecular weight (Mw): 70 000 g mol−1] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. NFC (1 wt%) was produced at Innventia AB, Sweden.
NFC manufacturing
Carboxymethylated NFC was produced by chemically pre-treating wood pulp (trade name Dissolving Plus, supplier Domsjö Fabriker) followed by high-shear mechanical delamination. It was found that through carboxymethylation, anionic carboxymethyl groups were chemically grafted onto the nanofibrils. The charge density of the modified pulp was about 500 μmol g−1, as determined using conductometric studies.
Composites preparation
The concentration of the NFC dispersion was diluted to 0.3 wt% before use. A NFC–PSSNa composite film was prepared by mixing PSSNa, NFC solution, glycerol and DMSO at a solid content (excluding water) weight ratio of 13.9/6.5/8.5/71.1. The mixture was homogenized for several minutes using a T10 basic ULTRA-TURRAX (IKA). The blend was then mixed ultrasonically in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min which was then followed by degassing for 1 h in a vacuum desiccator. Free-standing composite films were then prepared by pouring the NFC–PSSNa dispersions into plastic dishes with a diameter of 5.5 cm and then drying them at 60 °C for 24 h. After drying, the films were peeled off and cut into different shapes for the various measurements.
Characterization
The in-plane ionic conductivity of the NFC–PSSNa composite films were measured using an Alpha high-resolution dielectric analyzer for the impedance spectrometry (Novocontrol Technologies GmbH) with a two-probe method. The impedance spectra were recorded with an AC voltage of 5 mV while sweeping the frequency from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The samples were put inside a humidity chamber and the measurement was done at room temperature at humidity levels from 50 to 100 RH%. The ionic conductivity was calculated from the real part of the impedance where the phase angle was near zero.
The Seebeck coefficient of the composite films was measured at different humidities inside a humidity chamber at room temperature. The voltage difference between the two electrodes was recorded using a model 2182A nanovoltmeter (ΔV) (Keithley Instruments, Inc) and the temperature difference (ΔT) between the two electrodes was evaluated using the thermocouples and measured using a Model 2000 multimeter (Keithley Instruments, Inc). At each humidity, different sets of high and low temperatures with an average of 22.5 °C were applied and the Seebeck coefficient was extracted from the slope of the linear fitted voltage versus temperature difference curves.
The specific heats of the samples were measured using DSC at room temperature and the thermal diffusivity, D ≡ κ/ρcP and thermal conductivity κ (in the plane of the film) were measured using the AC-calorimetric technique of Hatta et al.34 In this technique, the sample was heated with chopped white light, which was partly blocked by a screen and the oscillating temperature on the reverse surface was measured with a thermocouple. Because the samples were white and translucent, a 0.3 μm film of lead sulfide was evaporated on the front surface to absorb the light. The diffusivity was determined by the variation of the oscillating thermocouple voltage with position, D = πf/(dln(Vac)/dx)2 (the saturation of the signal for large x0 − x which was because of the edge of the screen reaching the thermocouple glue and the deviations from the linear behavior for small x0 − x were because of the signal approaching the noise level).
The transmittance spectra were acquired with a Lambda 900 UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer instruments) at room temperature in the range of 400–800 nm.
AFM measurement was performed using a Dimension 3100 microscope (Bruker) under ambient conditions with a scan size of 1 × 1 μm.
For tensile testing, 30 μm thick samples were cut into 30 × 15 mm test pieces which were measured in a tensile tester (MTS) with the pulling speed of 30 mm (100%)/min = 0.5 mm s−1 at 23 °C and 50 RH%. Data for eight separate samples were collected to monitor statistical variations.
