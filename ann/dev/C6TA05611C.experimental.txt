Cellulose extraction
Cellulose was extracted from orange peel as described elsewhere44,45 (Fig. 1). Briefly, the peel of tangerine (Citrus tangerine) was first dried and crushed into powder in a mixer grinder. The oil and coloring impurities of the powdered peel were then removed with a water/ethanol (15 : 85, v/v) mixture at 85 °C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation; the step was repeated until a colorless material was obtained. The pectin was then removed by treating the colorless peel extract with an 80 mM ammonium oxalate solution at 20 °C for 1 h, succeeded by depolymerization with a 50 mM hydrochloric acid solution at 80 °C for 1 h. In the final step of isolation the depolymerized pectin was removed by a 50 mM NaOH solution at 5 °C for 1 h. Each of the above steps were repeated thrice with centrifugation and washing. Finally, the samples were washed with deionized water (DI) consecutively five times followed by freeze-drying for 48 h. Finally, the dried cellulose was kept in a vacuum desiccator before use. The obtained cellulose nano-fibers were denoted as EC.

Tosylation of cellulose
Cellulose needs to be homogeneously solubilized for carrying out the tosylation reaction. The DMAc/LiCl system has been reported to be the most efficient for obtaining soluble cellulose;46 thus, 40 mg of extracted cellulose mixed with 1.4 g of LiCl in 110 mL of anhydrous DMAc was stirred at 70 °C for 5 h, and then at room temperature overnight.
To the above solution of cellulose 2.36 mL of triethylamine was injected under a continuous N2 flow at 4 °C. Afterwards, 2.7 g of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride was added to the reaction mixture. The tosylation reaction was carried out at 8 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then poured into ice cold water and was put into an automated shaker for 15 min. The content of the flask was collected and washed with ethanol under refluxing conditions, after which the precipitate was filtered and washed with ethanol and dried under a vacuum. The obtained tosylated cellulose was denoted as TC.
Quaternization of cellulose
The quaternization of cellulose was carried out following a report published elsewhere (Scheme 1).47 Briefly, tosylated cellulose (25 mg) was reacted with DABCO (1.73 g) in 5 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) under refluxing conditions for 3 days. The obtained product was collected with ethyl acetate and washed with diethyl ether and ethyl acetate, respectively; finally the DABCO functionalized cellulose (QC) was dried in a vacuum oven at 45 °C.

Chloromethylation and quaternization of polysulfone
Polysulfone (PSf) was chloromethylated similar to a method reported by Zhang et al.48 Typically, PSf (2 g) was dissolved in 80 mL chloroform at room temperature, and 120 μL of tin chloride (SnCl4, anhydrous) was then added to the PSf solution. To this solution CMEE (3.8 mL) was added in aliquots and the reaction was carried out for 24 h at 40–45 °C under a N2 atmosphere. The chloromethylated PSf was poured into methanol and stirred overnight, then it was repeatedly washed with methanol and finally it was put in a vacuum oven and dried overnight. The dried product was denoted as CPSf.
The quaternization of CPSf was carried out with DABCO in DMF; briefly 2 g of CPSf was dissolved in DMF (20 mL), and DABCO (2 eqv. with respect to the repeating unit of CPSf) was added to the above solution. The reaction was then allowed to proceed for 12 h at 70 °C under continuous stirring. Subsequently, the whole reaction mixture was poured in diethyl ether and washed repeatedly with diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. The washed product was vacuum dried at 50 °C for 24 h. The DABCO functionalized CPSf was denoted as QPSf and was stored in a vacuum desiccator before use.
Nanocomposite formation and membrane preparation
The schematic representation of the formation of the nanocomposite is shown in Scheme 2; firstly, a 17 wt% solution of QPSf in DMF was prepared which was then mixed with different weight percentages of QC (0, 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15) under vigorous mechanical stirring for 12 h at 70 °C. Prior to mixing a 10 wt% QC homogeneous suspension was formed in DMF at room temperature under high mechanical shearing. Then to the QC and QPSf mixed solution 1,4-dibromobutane (5 equivalents with respect to QPSf) was added, and the solution was allowed to stir for an additional 30 min at 60 °C. The cross-linking of the two components was then performed by pouring the pre-gel solution on a glass Petri dish; membranes of uniform thickness were obtained after completely evaporating the solvent at 70 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven. The membranes were denoted as QPSf/DBB (polysulfone cross-linked with dibromobutane) and the nanocomposite membranes as QPSfQC1, QPSfQC3, QPSfQC5, QPSfQC10, and QPSfQC15 with the digits denoting the weight percentage of QC.

Water uptake (WU) and swelling ratio (SR)
The water uptake (WU) of the membrane was determined as follows: the dry weight of the membranes in Br− and OH− forms was measured until a constant weight was obtained, and it was denoted as W1. The dried membranes were then immersed in DI water for 24 h, after which they were taken out, the surface water was gently removed with a blotting paper and the wet weight (W2) was determined. Similarly, the swelling ratio (SR) is determined in the OH− form by measuring the length (cm) and the thickness (cm) of the membranes before and after immersion in water as mentioned above. The WU and the SR were then determined by following the equations as shown below:123where, SRip and SRtp are the in-plane and through-plane swelling ratios of the membranes. Lwet and Ldry are the lengths and Twet and Tdry are the thicknesses of the membranes under wet and dry conditions, respectively.
Ion exchange capacity (IEC)
The IEC measurement was adopted from previously published reports.8,30 Briefly, the membranes were cut into a desired area and were equilibrated in a 0.1 mol L−1 NaOH solution for 24 h. The membranes were then washed with DI water to remove excess NaOH. The washed membranes were then equilibrated with 50 mL of HCl solutions with 0.01 mol L−1 concentration. The amount of OH− ions liberated was estimated by acid–base titration. The ion-exchange capacity (IEC; mmol g−1) of the membrane was calculated by:4where, Va is the volume of the blank sample, Vb is the volume consumed for the test sample, CNaOH is the concentration of NaOH and Mdry is the mass of the dried samples.
In the case of DABCO–cellulose, the tosylated anions were exchanged with OH− ions by immersing the DABCO–cellulose membrane in 6 mol L−1 KOH for 72 h, followed by treating the membrane with 0.01 mol L−1 HCl for 24 h. The IEC was then determined similarly as mentioned above.
Ionic conductivity
The through-plane (σz) and in-plane (σxy) hydroxyl ion conductivity measurement of the membranes was carried out with a homemade two probe conductivity cells and determined from the impedance plot using a Zahner elektrik IM6 impedance spectrometer. The membranes were soaked in 1 mol L−1 aqueous KOH at room temperature for 24 h, and the OH− exchanged membranes were then stored in nitrogen saturated Millipore water for 48 h before the measurement. The membranes were taken out and placed in the conductivity cell and screwed tightly for maximum contact with the electrodes. The impedance plots were obtained in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 3 MHz with an amplitude of 50 mV under a N2 atmosphere in order to avoid carbonate contamination. The relative humidity of the membranes was maintained at 100% during the measurement. The anion conductivity was calculated by the following equation:5where, d (cm) is the length between the two electrodes; R (ohm) is the resistance of the membrane and A (cm2) is the area of the membrane.
Gel fraction
The gel fraction was determined by immersing the membranes in N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) for 72 h at 70 °C. The gel fraction was then calculated from the ratio of the weights before and after immersion.
Methanol permeability
The methanol permeability of the membranes was measured using a homemade two compartment H-type cell. The membranes were clamped between the two compartments. Compartment B was filled with 60 mL de-ionized water and compartment A was filled with 2 mol L−1 methanol in a 0.5 mol L−1 KOH solution, respectively. The methanol concentration in compartment B at different time intervals was determined by cyclic voltammetry49 using Pt/C (5% Pt) mixed with Nafion solution (5%) deposited indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass (active area: 0.25 cm2) as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (NaCl, 3 M) as the reference electrode. The CV measurements were carried out in a 0.5 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution. Prior to the measurements a calibration curve was obtained with known concentrations of methanol solutions.
Mechanical properties
The mechanical properties in terms of tensile strength and elongation at break were determined under dry and wet conditions. In the case of wet samples the membranes were first OH− exchanged by treatment with a 1 M KOH solution for 24 h, followed by immersion in DI water for 48 h. All the samples cut into 2 cm × 7 cm (width × length) were clammed between the jaws of a universal testing machine (Instron 5982) with a load cell of 1 kN, and the analysis was then carried out at a constant crosshead speed of 1 mm min−1. All measurements of the samples were carried out at room temperature.
Instrumentation
The FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded by an FTIR spectrometer (JASCO FT-IR 300E). The 1H-NMR spectra of the samples were analyzed by a 400 MHz FT-NMR Spectrometer (Avance II, Bruker Biospin). The morphology of the samples was studied by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi S-4700, Japan). Prior to the analysis by SEM, the samples were sputtered with a thin layer of platinum using a Balzers Union SCD 040 sputtering apparatus. In order to reveal the architecture–morphology–properties of the membranes atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using an XE-150 atomic force microscope (Park system, Korea). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the membranes was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/MAX-2200, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation at a wavelength of 1.5406 Å.
