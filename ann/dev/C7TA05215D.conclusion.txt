5.Conclusions
We have successfully prepared a hybrid conducting nanocomposite of PANI stippled graphene through a self-assembly process. Modification and exfoliation of graphites were made using a bio-based amphiphilic dopant, 3-PDPP, which serves the multiple roles of exfoliation, self-organisation, and doping during the formation of the PANI stippled graphene hybrid composites. These hybrid nanocomposite PGPCs exhibited excellent conductivity (2.32 S cm−1), thermal stability, electrochemical stability, and specific surface area. Finally, we have demonstrated PGPCs as excellent electrodes for the fabrication of symmetrical supercapacitors and measured the specific capacitance of all the devices, among which PGPC4 exhibited 812.55 F g−1 in the PVA–H3PO4 gel electrolyte and 791.26 F g−1 in the aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte at 1 mA g−1 current density. The energy density of the PGPC4 device is 112.85 Wh kg−1 in PVA–H3PO4 and 109.89 Wh kg−1 in Na2SO4 and the power density was 379.32 W kg−1 in PVA–H3PO4 and 765.19 W kg−1 in Na2SO4 at the same current density. The cycling stability was up to 2000 cycles with an 80% retention in specific capacitance. These excellent performances of the prepared PGPCs suggest it as an excellent electrode for the fabrication of energy storage microelectronic devices.
