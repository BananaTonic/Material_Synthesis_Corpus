2.1Synthesis of compounds
BaFeO2.5 was prepared from BaCO3 and Fe2O3via solid state reaction as described in a previous article.5
For the preparation of the hydrated phases of BaFeO2.5 (called low- (LW-BaFeO2.5) and high-water (HW-BaFeO2.5) phases in the following), a setup as described in ref. 13 was used. The nebulizer was filled with deionized water and a very wet gas stream was produced by applying an argon flow (99.996% purity; to rule out oxidation of the powders) of 1 standard liter per minute (SLM) and fed over heated powder of BaFeO2.5. Different hydration temperatures of 120 °C, 150 °C, and 180 °C were examined, where the lower temperature led to the formation of HW-BaFeO2.5 and the two higher temperatures led to the formation of LW-BaFeO2.5.
Pellets of BaFeO2.5 were made by sintering the isostatically pressed sample (600 kN, 1 min) at 1373 K for 12 h under flowing Ar (purity 99.996%). To test the influence of oxidation, one such pellet was also heated under flowing oxygen at 773 K for 15 h. Attempts to hydrate the as-synthesized pellets did not prove to be successful and resulted in cracking (i.e. the pellets were very brittle) due to the strong volume increase upon hydration (see Section 3.3). Therefore, a pellet of LW-BaFeO2.5 was prepared by isostatically pressing an uniaxially prepressed pellet of the powder at 600 kN for 1 min (for better comparison a non-sintered pellet of non-hydrated BaFeO2.5 was also prepared using the same method). The as-prepared pellets were carefully polished and gold was sputtered on both sides to ensure good contacting for the subsequent impedance analysis. Whereas the sintered pellets of BaFeO2.5 showed high densities of ∼91% of the crystallographic density, non-sintered pellets of BaFeO2.5 as well as its hydrated compounds showed lower densities in the range of 68–83%.
2.2Diffraction experiments
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the oxide and hydrated compounds were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer with Bragg-Brentano geometry and a fine focus X-ray tube with Cu anode. No primary beam monochromator was attached. A VANTEC detector and a fixed divergence slit (0.1°) were used. The total scan time was 10 hours for the angular range between 5 and 130° 2θ.
High-temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the hydrated compounds were recorded on the same setup (except for using a 0.3° fixed divergence slit) using an Anton Paar HTK 1200N High-Temperature Oven-Chamber in the temperature range between 50 and 550 °C.
Time of flight powder neutron diffraction (NPD) data were recorded on the HRPD high resolution diffractometer at the ISIS pulsed spallation source (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK). 4 g of powdered samples of LW- and HW-BaFeO2.5 were loaded into 8 mm diameter thin-walled, cylindrical vanadium sample cans and data collected at ambient temperature (RT) and 4 K for 320 μA h proton beam current to the ISIS target (corresponding to ∼10 hours of beam time). HW-BaFeO2.5 was additionally heated at temperatures of 393, 423, 573, 773, and 1173 K to observe structure transformations of the compound, in these cases with reduced measurement times of 120 μA h proton beam current (∼3 hours of beam time). For HW-BaFeO2.5, it was observed that for the measurements recorded at 393 and 423 K (under vacuum) the compound had already transformed into LW-BaFeO2.5, whereas at all other higher temperatures as well as on the final measurement at RT, the compound had released all of the water to form monoclinic BaFeO2.5.
Refinement of the structures of the hydrated BaFeO2.5 compounds was performed with the program TOPAS Academic 5 (ref. 14 and 15) using the NPD data collected from all of the HRPD detector banks 1–3 as well as the XRD data. Details concerning the structural analysis will be extensively discussed in Section 3.2.
2.3Thermogravimetric measurements
Thermogravimetric (TG) measurements were recorded for LW- and HW-BaFeO2.5 on a Netzsch STA 429 thermal analyser in the temperature range between 300 and 673 K using a heating rate of 5 K min−1 under a constant flow of argon gas, with the sample placed in Al2O3 crucibles. The data curves were corrected with the data curve recorded for the empty crucible.
2.4IR spectroscopy
Fourier transform infrared (IR) spectroscopy data were recorded using a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer (Bruker, USA). The compound was mixed with KBr in an approximate ratio of 1 : 20, ground in a mortar and pressed into a pellet of 15 mm diameter and 0.5 mm thickness. The spectra were recorded in a range between 400 and 4000 cm−1 with a step size of 4 cm−1.
2.5Impedance measurements
AC impedance spectroscopy was used to determine the conductivity of the different sintered and non-sintered pellets (see Section 3.3). Pellets were sputtered with a thin layer of gold on both sides to allow for proper electrical contact. The samples were placed in a JANIS STVP-200-XG cryostat, which can be operated under a static helium atmosphere of 1 bar pressure and were investigated in variable temperature ranges between 200 and 500 K. Impedance measurements were performed using a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyzer applying an AC signal with 100 mV amplitude over a frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 mHz. The impedance data were fitted using the ZView program.16
