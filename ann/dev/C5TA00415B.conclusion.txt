Conclusions
In summary, a simple method is demonstrated to introduce a defined porous structure in a PES/PVP blended membrane. By altering the added amount of silica spheres in the membrane preparation process, the porous structure and porosity is effectively regulated. Such a porous structure leads to a balance of the proton conductivity with the mechanical properties. Due to submicro-pores in the blends, a PA-rich domain or network is formed, which is conducive to PA loading and proton transfer, and consequently, improves the proton conductivity. The maximum power density reaches ∼454 mW cm−2 in a H2/O2 fuel cell at 180 °C without external humidification. The above results demonstrate that submicro-pore containing PES/PVP blended membranes are capable of operating at low humidity and elevated high temperatures, showing promising potential in applications as proton transfer media in high-temperature PEMFCs. Most significantly, although there is plenty of room to regulate the electrochemical performance of our PA doped membrane system, such as the long-term durability, the approaches demonstrated in this work offer promising opportunities to regulate the microstructure for PA retention and compromise the enhanced proton conductivity with excellent mechanical properties in a peculiar way.
