2.1Sample preparation
Nanoparticle derived layers were fabricated via the spin coating of hydroxide nanoparticle inks. The sample preparation included four steps: (1) solvent thermal synthesis of nanoparticles and ink preparation, (2) spin-coating of nanoparticle ink in an NH3-containing atmosphere, (3) ETA modification of NP derived layers and (4) post-annealing of NP derived layers (with and without ETA modification) in forming gas (95% N2/5% H2) at 300 °C. A sequential order of the four steps is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Preparation procedure for nanoparticle derived layers with ETA modification.
Step (1): preparation of additive-free nanoparticle ink
The synthetic method of nanoparticles was modified from a previous publication.26 Indium tri-chloride (InCl3, Sigma-Aldrich, 98%) and tin tetra-chloride (SnCl4, Sigma-Aldrich, nonaqueous, 98%) were taken as metal precursors, while solid NaOH (granule, Sigma-Aldrich) as the catalyst and ethylene glycol (Carl Roth, 99%) as the solvent. All the chemicals were used without further treatment. The molar ratio between InCl3 and SnCl4 was maintained as 9 : 1 (10% doping), and a reaction temperature of 190 °C and a reaction time of 6 days were selected for the synthesis. The reacted nanoparticles were collected via centrifugation at 12 000 rpm min−1 for 15 min (Eppendorf, Centrifuge 5810R), and the collected nanoparticles were washed twice with distilled water to remove solvent residuals. To prepare nanoparticle ink, the collected nanoparticles (without drying) were re-dispersed in distilled water (DI) under magnetic stirring, without adding any stabilizing agents or organic additives. A series of inks with different solid loadings (concentrations) ranging from 2 wt% to 30 wt% could be prepared by adding the required amount of distilled water into the collected nanoparticles. The prepared inks are visually clear and free of sedimentation even after over 1 year storage at room temperature.
Step (2): spin coating under a controlled atmosphere
Spin-coating was performed at room temperature, with a rotation speed of 2000 rpm min−1 and a duration of 30 seconds for each layer. Soda-lime glasses, with a thickness of 1 mm and a size of 2.5 × 2.5 cm, were taken as substrates for depositing the prepared nanoparticle inks. They were cleaned in a consequential order with diluted acetic acid, isopropanol and DI water, and finished with oxygen plasma cleaning for 5 min to improve surface wettability. In order to achieve nanoparticle layers free of cracks and surface defects, ink concentration as well as the chamber atmosphere was optimized.
To minimize the presence of cracks in the obtained nanoparticle layer, ink concentrations varying from 30 wt% to 2 wt% were tested in a manner of single layer. With the optimized ink concentration (2 wt%), the spin-coating process was repeated multiple times to obtain the required thickness and a heating step at 80 °C for 1 min was applied between every two adjacent layers. The NH3-containing chamber atmosphere was found effective in reducing surface defects such as streaks and comets and improving layer homogeneity. This atmosphere was generated by spin-coating 14 wt% NH4OH water solution on a spare substrate, which was different from the substrates used for the spin-coating of nanoparticle layers. Afterwards, the spare substrate was taken out of the spin-coating chamber and the atmosphere was generated, followed by the fabrication of nanoparticle layers.
Step (3): ETA modification of nanoparticle derived layers
Ligand modification was performed on the as-deposited precursor layers before the final annealing step. Ethanolamine (ETA, Sigma-Aldrich, ≥98%) was selected for ligand modification of hydroxide precursor layers. ETA was first dissolved in absolute ethanol with a concentration of 5 mM, and the samples were fixed in a Teflon sample holder and immersed in the solution for 24 hours. The solution was stirred at room temperature during the immersion time. The samples were rinsed with isopropanol continuously for 3 min after taking out from the ETA solution. We also attempted direct mixing of ligands into the nanoparticle ink; however, it caused agglomeration of nanoparticles and the spin-coated layers showed a much rougher surface.
Step (4): post annealing in forming gas
Nanoparticle layers with and without ETA modification were dried for 30 min on a preheated hot plate in air and then annealed for 3 hours in forming gas (mixture of 95% N2 and 5% H2) at 300 °C.
2.2Characterization techniques
ITOH nanoparticle dispersions were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential on a Zetasizer Nano series (Malvern). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed using a field emission FET Titan 80-300 operated at 300 kV. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on nanoparticle powder were performed with a Netzsch STA 449 F3 Jupiter in synthetic air in a temperature range from room temperature to 600 °C at a ramping speed of 5 °C per min.
Thin layers before and after annealing were analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on a Quantum 2000 from Physical Electronics with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) operated at a base pressure below 8 × 10−7 Pa. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of nanoparticle layers was carried out to detect the phase transformation of nanoparticle layers with and without ETA modification along with the increase of annealing temperatures. The measurements were performed on a PANanalytical diffractometer (X'Pert Pro PW3040) equipped with Ni-filtered Cu Kα-radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). In situ XRD measurements were conducted at temperatures of 200 °C, 225 °C, 250 °C, 275 °C and 300 °C, with a holding time of 30 min at each temperature. Transmittance was measured with a UV-Vis spectrometer Shimadzu UV-3600 from 200 nm to 2000 nm taking air as the reference (baseline). The electrical dc conductivity of annealed layers was measured by Hall-effect measurement on ECOPIA HMS3000 apparatus using the van der Pauw contacting configuration with gold contacts.
