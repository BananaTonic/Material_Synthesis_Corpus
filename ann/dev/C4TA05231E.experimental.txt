The LPGS solid solution was synthesized using a solid-state reaction. In this process, mixtures of P2S5 (Aldrich, 99% purity), Li2S (Nihon Kagaku Kogyo, &gt;99.9% purity), and GeS2 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory Co., Ltd., &gt;99.99% purity) were ground in a vibrating mill (CMT, Tl-100) for 30 min, pelletized under 220 MPa pressure, sealed in a silica tube at 30 Pa, and heated at 673 K for 8 h with 2.2 K min−1 heating rate and 0.60 K min−1 cooling rate. The resulting products were again subjected to grinding and mixing, after which the samples were once again pelletized under 220 MPa, followed by heat treatment at 823 K for 8 h with 3.0 K min−1 heating rate and 0.76 K min−1 cooling rate. Ionic conductivity values were measured using samples approximately 10 mm in diameter and 2–3 mm in height which had been pelletized under 165 MPa and sintered at 873 K for 8 h with 3.3 K min−1 heating rate and 0.83 K min−1 cooling rate. Au powder was coated on the surfaces of samples. The AC impedance values of samples were measured using a frequency response analyzer (National Instrument, nF) by applying 10 mV over the frequency range of 100 Hz to 15 MHz.
X-ray diffraction patterns of the powdered samples were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, RAD, Ultima or Smart Lab) with CuKα radiation. The diffraction data were collected by applying a 0.02° step width over the 2θ range from 10° to 80°. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements were performed at the BL02B2 beamline at Spring-8 in Japan, employing a Debye–Scherrer diffraction camera. Specimens were sealed in a quartz capillary (about 0.3 mm diameter) under vacuum. Diffraction data were collected in 0.01° steps over the 2θ range of 0° to 70.0°. The incident beam wavelength was calibrated using a NIST SRM Ceria 640b CeO2 and fixed at 0.59960 Å. Neutron diffraction data were obtained using time-of-flight (TOF) diffractometers: Super HRPD (BL08)13 and iMATERIA (BL20)13,14 at the Material and Life science Facility (MLF) of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC). A 6 mm diameter vanadium cell was used and samples were sealed with an indium ring under Ar or He atmospheres. The diffraction data were collected for 12 h at several temperatures: Li10.5Ge1.5P1.5S12: 300 K, Li10.35Ge1.35P1.65S12: 4.8, 135, and 300 K, Li10.2Ge1.2P1.8S12: 300 K and Li10.05Ge1.05P1.95S12: 10, 135, 300, 450, and 750 K. Structural parameters were refined using the Rietveld refinement programs Z-Rietveld15 and RIETAN-FP16,17 for neutron and for high-flux synchrotron X-ray diffraction data, respectively. During neutron data analysis, the d region from 1.0 to 3.5 Å was used for the Rietveld analysis. The Z-MEM program was employed during calculations based on the maximum entropy method (MEM).18 Z-3D19 was used to visualize the nuclear density map of the structure.
