Conclusions
In conclusion, we explored dual functional 3D hierarchical filter element structured Mo2C materials for lithium sulfur batteries. The filter-like Mo2C nanosheets provide satisfactory electronic conductivity (30 S cm−1) and the ability to confine diffusing lithium polysulfides on the sulfur electrodes. The Mo2C based sulfur electrodes delivered an initial specific discharge capacity of 1198.5 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency of 95.7% at a rate of 0.2C. The long-term cycling performance was also examined at 0.2C with a capacity of 789.4 mA h g−1 after 300 cycles. The high sulfur mass loading of 4.68 mg cm−2 had been achieved along with a high areal capacity of 3.24 mA h cm−2. The freestanding and flexible electrodes were also evaluated through in situ growth of S@Mo2C on carbon cloth. The soft-package flexible electrodes delivered a discharge capacity of 1180.7 mA h g−1 in the first cycle at 0.2C and show excellent flexibility after repeated bending.
