3.Results and discussion
The schematic of the synthesis of various PDMS/PEO- and LiClO4-based SEs used for the present study is shown in Fig. 1A, and details are given in the materials section. Fig. 1A shows the formation of a transparent flexible film of PEO/PDMS and LiClO4. Photographs of each sample and its transparency are shown in ESI Fig. S1. A video of the synthesis procedure is given in the ESI. XRD patterns of PDMS (pristine – cured film), PEO (powder), PEO–PDMS (film) and PEO–PDMS hybrids complexed with various amounts of LiClO4 (LiPEOP 1, LiPEOP 2, LiPEOP 3 and LiPEOP 4) are shown in Fig. 1B. The XRD pattern of PDMS shows a semi-crystalline peak centred around 15°.21 This indicates that PDMS is in the glassy region and is in agreement with the reports that PDMS has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of −125 °C.22 PEO shows well-defined crystalline peaks centred at 19° and 23° corresponding to (032) and (112) lattice planes, in agreement with previous reports.23,24
(A) Synthesis sequences involved in the development of transparent and flexible SE. A transparent flexible SE is shown in the last sequence where the “tifr” logo is shown in the backside with the SE held using tweezers. (B), (C), (D) and (E) are XRD patterns, Raman spectra, UV-visible spectra and WCA (error bars are also shown) of various samples, respectively. LiClO4 amounts are varied (increased) from LiPEOP 1 to LiPEOP 4 (optimised composition).
But the PDMS–PEO film did not show crystallinity as exhibited by PEO film (Fig. 1B). The absence of crystalline PEO–PDMS can be explained as follows: the curing temperature of PDMS is around 80 °C, above PEO's crystalline melting temperature (∼60 °C; a later section discusses this).25 This may result in the formation of a eutectic mixture of PEO and PDMS where PEO loses its long-range crystalline order due to the intercalated PDMS matrix. Hence PDMS acts like a plasticizer in the PEO–PDMS film. There are still long range ordered PEO channels and this is further probed by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as described later. The addition of Li salt in PEO–PDMS matrix further modifies the crystallinity and inter-planar distances of PEO.26 LiPEOP 4 shows a shift in the PEO crystalline peaks to higher angles along with the appearance of an additional LiClO4 crystalline peak at ∼31°.27
A detailed study on the infrared and Raman spectra of the samples was conducted, and the most relevant vibrational bands are discussed (see Table 2 and FTIR spectra in ESI Fig. S2). Characteristic peaks of PDMS are present in all the samples, and signatures of PEO are also present in all the samples except for pristine PDMS.28,29 On increasing the LiClO4 loading concentration, it is interesting to note from the Raman spectra that the peak intensity corresponding to LiClO4, which is around 938 cm−1, shows an increase in intensity, which in turn gives evidence for the improved Li salt density in the amorphous matrix. On increasing the salt loading concentrations in PEO–PDMS, the polymeric –OH stretching vibrations and –CH bending vibrations become suppressed and this can be from the molecular restructuring due to the salting in process, a phenomenon further confirmed from the DMA and DSC studies.

PDMS film shows a transmittance of ∼90% in the visible range as observed by others.30 The addition of PEO and LiClO4 does not affect the transmittance much, and LiPEOP 4 (the optimized SE) shows a transmittance of ∼85%. Photographs showing the transmittance of the various films are also given in the ESI Fig. S1.
Pristine PDMS possesses a very high WCA (&gt;115°),31 and is hydrophobic in nature while PEO is hygroscopic.32 The PEO's hygroscopic nature is quite undesirable while it is being used as a Li-ion SE. The results of WCA measurements on various films are given in Fig. 1E and the ESI Fig. S3. PEO–PDMS film shows a WCA of ∼113°. LiPEOP 4 has a WCA &gt;100°, and hence it is still hydrophobic in nature. The changes in the WCA of PEO–PDMS indicate the changes in the physio-chemical properties of the film upon the addition of LiClO4 (LiPEOP 4 film was washed in DI water several times and dried before carrying out the WCA measurements to ensure the removal of surface impurities or LiClO4).
In a polymer electrolyte, the ion transport property depends upon long-range ion motion and hopping, and polymer chain relaxation and cross-linking measure the extent of these phenomena.24,29 So at sub-ambient temperatures, ionic conductivity is less due to the large stiffness of the polymer chains and their slower relaxation processes. Further, the relaxation in polymer–salt complex is governed by the local viscosity of polymer chains. Hence insertion/addition of another polymer with lower Tg can augment the ion transport due to changes in the local viscosity of the polymer matrix even at low temperatures. This conceptual feasibility of improvement in ion-pair/dipolar relaxation and local chain motion in polymers with low Tg can in turn improve the ion transport behaviour and it has been employed to realize high ion conducting polymer blend at ambient/room temperatures. But the interface of different polymers plays a crucial role in the mechanical/interfacial stabilities of the resultant polymer blend and also the ion transport. Hence studies on the thermo-mechanical properties of the polymer composite are important, and here the complex modulus of various samples is studied using DMA and the results are shown in Fig. 2A (Fig. 2A also shows the clamped LiPEOP 4 film in the tensile clamp of the DMA apparatus). The loss modulus and storage modulus, and their ratio (tan δ) are shown in the figure. PDMS has a Young's modulus of ∼1.4 MPa, and this matches with previous reports.22 LiPEOP 4 shows a Young's modulus of ∼0.98 MPa, indicating the mechanical robustness of the film. PDMS does not show any phase transition in the temperature range studied since its Tg is well below 0 °C, while PEO–PDMS shows a Tg-like transition at around 70 °C (peak in tan δ). This corresponds to the crystalline melting point of PEO (PEO has Tg ∼ −67 °C), as reported by others.25 The tan δ value of ∼0.1 indicates the viscoelastic nature of the films. The addition of LiClO4 to PEO–PDMS is found to downshift the PEO crystalline melting point. LiPEOP 1 has a transition temperature at ∼59 °C while that of LiPEOP 2 is at 38 °C. The crystalline melting temperatures of LiPEOP 3 and LiPEOP 4 samples are further downshifted to below 30 °C.
(A) DMA: thermo-mechanical data. The crystalline melting regions are marked in the plots. A film (LIPEOP 4) held in a DMA tensile clamp is shown in the figure. The top part holding the film is the fixed clamp while the bottom clamp is the movable one. (B) and (C) respectively show DSC and TGA curves of the various samples. Surface morphology, scanning electron microscope image (SEM), of one of the LiPEOP samples is also shown in the inset of (B).
DSC and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the samples were done and the curves are shown in Fig. 2(B) and (C) respectively. On adding the LiClO4 salt to the PEO–PDMS complex, as an effect of the ‘salting in’ phenomenon, the shift in crystalline melting point (Tm) of PEO towards room temperature is well evident while a right shift is seen for Tg of PDMS. It is to be noted that no weight loss is observed for any of the samples until 300 °C from the TGA curves (indicating the absence of other solvents such as ethanol), and beyond 300 °C weight loss due to the decomposition of PEO–PDMS complex is also observed.
Due to their highly ordered chain structure, PEO chains tend to crystallize. This adversely affects the ion transport and hence PEO electrolytes have ionic conductivity much below that of liquid electrolytes. It has also been observed that addition of plasticizers to reduce the crystallinity can cause poor mechanical properties and interfacial instabilities.10 A reduction in the crystalline melting point of PEO to room temperature while retaining compatibility upon the addition of salts like KI has been observed by other researchers.25 It is reported that this phenomenon is due to an ion–dipole interaction assisted salting in process (increase in the solubility of the solute (LiClO4)). Though the ion–dipole interaction effect in PEO–LiClO4 has not been studied before, it is reported that the high polarizability of ClO4− can induce a dipole moment in alkyl chains, thereby introducing ion–dipole interactions between PEO and LiClO4.24
But, it is not clear from the earlier reports whether the anion or cation takes part in the ion–dipole interactions. The salting in effect has been reported in nonaqueous solutions like methanol but aqueous solutions are found to exhibit a salting out phenomenon. Here, the gelation of PEO–PDMS has been accomplished in ethanol. It is also observed that the salt (LiClO4) dissolved in ethanol gives the highest ionic conductivity (discussed in the next paragraph). The non-binding nature of the cation has been observed in polyvinyl pyrrolidone.33 Hence the ion–dipole interactions via the anions (ClO4−) are the root cause of the marked changes observed in the PEO–PDMS polymer properties upon the addition of LiClO4 (anion is bound to the polymer) and for the optimum salt concentrations, salt–polymer adduct can behave as a polyelectrolyte. Moreover, it is reported that the addition of salting in agents like LiClO4 can significantly affect the gelation phase behaviour of polymers.33 The crystallization-induced gelation boundaries can be shifted and the polymer membranes can be more porous. Hence, the microstructure can also become modified with the addition of LiClO4 to PEO–PDMS matrix. The selective anion binding and changes in the polymer properties and microstructure can aid PEO–PDMS–LiClO4 based membranes to act as Li+ ion conductive membranes, and their ionic conducting properties are analysed in the following section.
To probe the ion transport mechanism and conductivity, impedance spectroscopy studies (Nyquist plots) and temperature dependent ionic conductivity measurements (Fig. 4) were conducted by sandwiching the films in two-electrode (stainless steel electrodes of 12 mm in diameter) parallel plate capacitor geometry (results are shown in Fig. 3). The conventional equations (eqn (1) and (2)) are employed to deduce the ionic conductivity values (σ) from impedance plots,34–36 and both equations are found to give similar values:
Nyquist plots of the samples (the corresponding Randles circuit is shown in the inset).
From Nyquist plot: 1
From dielectric constant and loss factor: 2σ = 2πνε0εr tan δwhere l is the thickness of the sample, A the contact area between the electrode and sample, Rb the bulk impedance of the sample, ν the frequency, tan δ the loss factor and ε0 and εr the absolute (free space) and relative permittivity values. It is found that the room temperature ionic conductivity from pristine PDMS (it is just AC conductivity since there are no ions) to the maximum Li salt loaded sample LiPEOP 4 varies from 0.198 nS cm−1 to 0.03 mS cm−1. The multiple times water-washed and dried (at 100 °C) LiPEOP 4 film also shows similar conductivity, indicating that humidity has negligible influence, unlike the previous reports on other SPEs. LiPEOP 4 having different thicknesses can be made and their conductivity values are tabulated in ESI Fig. S6 and S7.
Further, the temperature (from room temperature to 75 °C) dependent ionic conductivities of the samples are measured by sandwiching the films in a parallel plate capacitor configuration, and measuring the conductivity upon varying the temperature. As the SPEs have free volume that characterizes their properties, SPE temperature dependent conductivity is found to deviate from Arrhenius behaviour (which is meant for crystalline matrices).37 Therefore the conductivity values are fitted with the more appropriate Vogel-Tammann-Fulcher (VTF) (eqn (3)) model (see Fig. 4 and more in ESI Fig. S4 and S5):38

It is to be noted that on increasing the salt loading concentration, the ionic conductivities of the samples also show improved values, which is correlated with the decrease in the crystalline melting temperature (Tm) of PEO (indicating the amorphization of the matrix) as well as the increase in ion carrier density (σ0, Table 3). The calculated pseudo-activation energy Ev, the apparent activation energy which opposes the segmental motion of polymer chains,39 is also found to increase from LiPEOP 1 to LiPEOP 4. This indicates the increased occupancy of the salt inside the polymer matrix with loading. However these values are comparatively small so that a moderate amount of salt hardly opposes the segmental motion of the polymer chains.40
To further support the observed room temperature high Li+ ion conductivity, which is the result of the shift in Tm towards room temperature as evident from DSC and DMA studies, the transport capability of ions at room temperature, specifically Li+ ions (since anion (ClO4−) is heavy and also due to the ion–dipole interaction discussed previously, it will hardly contribute to the transport number),24 for each sample was calculated using DC polarization and AC impedance measurements employing the following equation:404where I0 is the initial current, Iss the steady state current, ΔV the DC voltage applied and R0 and Rss the initial and steady state bulk resistances of the SEs. A DC voltage of 10 mV was applied across each sample in a metal electrode–sample (SE)–metal (Li|SE|Li) configuration (Fig. 5A; the current variation is shown in Fig. 5A (bottom)) and it is evident from the observed data that upon increasing the LiClO4 loading concentration, the transport (transference) number increases to 0.69 for LiPEOP 4. This is in stark contrast to conventional polymer electrolytes which have low Li transference number at room temperature, &lt;0.6, and hence they have limited power delivery during discharge due to polarization effects.41 PEO chains coiled around the Li cations constitute the basic structure of Li salt dissolved SPEs.11 This also separates Li+ cations from their counter anions. It is established that the segmental motions and local relaxation of polymer matrices (here PEO–PDMS) allow Li+ transport through them, which is possible only when the polymer matrix is amorphous. Conventional PEO-based SEs can outperform in Li transport (hence can give rise to high Li transport number)8 only above ∼67 °C since this is the crystalline melting point (Tm) of PEO (as is evident from the present study (thermo-mechanical analyses) and also from earlier reports).25 Here the reduction in the Tm of PEO is observed while making the SEs with varying Li content. Besides these, as the present SE samples also contain siloxanes (PDMS), which possess an oxygen backbone, can also further increases the number of anionic repeat units in the SE matrix. This eventually decreases the poly-anion contribution towards the total ionic transport. Hence the synergistic effects such as the presence of PDMS and amorphization of the PEO matrices are the reasons behind the high Li transfer number observed in LiPEOP 4. A theoretical understanding of the Li transport through this matrix is still in progress.

Favourable electrochemical window is another key factor for the applications of SEs in energy devices.16 To identify the electrochemical window, where the material is neutral to the applied electrical potential, cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were obtained with the SEs sandwiched between Li electrode and stainless steel (SS-316) over 2–5 V (10 mV steps) using a Biologic SP300 potentiostat. On moving from pristine PDMS to LiPEOP 4, no faradaic current (oxidizing or reducing signals) is found in this potential window (Fig. 5B), irrespective of the improvement in the current due to the enhancement in ionic conductivity. This ensures the applicability of LiPEOP 4-based TSEs in Li-ion-based batteries.
The structural, spectroscopic, mechanical and electrochemical analyses show the effect of microstructure modifications on the development of PEO–PDMS mixture, and formation of a polyelectrolyte up on the addition of LiClO4. Further, the salting in phenomenon can also affect the micropores in the membranes (as suggested by the SEM image, Fig. 2B (inset)). This suggests the following model (Fig. 6) for selective Li+ ion transport through the PEO–PDMS membrane.
A proposed model for the augmented ion transport through the PEO–PDMS–LiClO4 based SEs.
PEO is the favourite polymer in polymer electrolytes due to its ability to form complexes with Li salt resulting in its dissociation and Li+ ion transport (Fig. 6 (top)).42 But the highly ordered chain structure makes PEO matrix crystalline and impedes ion transport. PDMS is acting like a plasticizer (as evident from XRD) in the highly ordered PEO structure, while the addition of LiClO4 in ethanol introduces the salting in effect where a polymer-anion (ClO4−) interaction makes the matrix a polyelectrolyte. Further, the addition of salts like LiClO4 can make micropores inside the polymer matrix (Fig. 6 (bottom)), aiding the Li+ transport through the membrane leading to a high ionic conductivity, close to one of the highest reported values for polymer electrolytes to our best knowledge.
A symmetric capacitor configuration is assembled employing transparent conducting oxide (ITO)-based electrodes and the transparent SE (TSE/TSPE) LiPEOP 4 as both solid ionic conductor (dielectric) and separator (Fig. 7A inset). The direct electrophoretic deposition of graphene oxide solution in water at −1 V on the TSE is conducted to make a flexible cell, where the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) deposited will act as a high surface area electrode (Fig. 7; both sides can be electrodeposited using RGO to make a complete flexible supercapacitor).43 This capacitor is cycled over 5000 cycles between 0 and 1 V at a Crate of 10 mA. The cells exhibit a high extent of cycling stability and a capacity of ∼1 F g−1 (the details of calculations are shown in the ESI). The Nyquist plots are obtained for the cell using ITO-LiPEOP 4-ITO as well as ITO-LiPEOP 4-RGO (where RGO is deposited on conductive sides of ITO plates) arrangements. As mentioned before, it is found that the capacity of the RGO-based capacitor is higher than that of the ITO-based one (a few nF g−1 to 1 F g−1; the cycling of the ITO-based symmetric capacitor is shown in the inset of Fig. 7A), indicating the evolution of double layer capacitance from the RGO-SE interface. In the impedance spectra, the semi-circle appeared to be extended to higher values in RGO-based geometry, and the Randles circuit (shown in the inset) containing double capacitance is fitted well with the Nyquist plot indicating the existence of double layer capacitance.
(A) Charge–discharge curves of the symmetric capacitor assembled using RGO-TSPE-LiPEOP 4 in a voltage window of 0–1 V at 1 mA g−1. (B) Nyquist plots of both the capacitors showing the traces for double layer capacitance in the RGO-based one (the corresponding Randles circuit fitted to RGO-ITO-LiPEOP 4 is shown in the inset). (C) Impedance curves of the flexible capacitor assembled using flexible silver coated plastic electrodes. (D) The rate performance curve of the assembled cell (Li/SE/LiFePO4 cell) is shown. The OCV of the cell is shown in the inset (2.59 V). A green LED that glowed using this cell OCV is also shown in the inset.
To test the working efficiency of the TSEs as flexible devices, AgCl-based printed flexible electrodes (AgIC Inc. Japan) are employed to assemble a sandwiched symmetric capacitor as shown in Fig. 7C. The Nyquist plots of the bent and un-bent states are shown in Fig. 7C, and it is found that one is overlying the other even after many bends. This implies the suitability of TSEs as electrolytes for flexible supercapacitors.
To verify the efficacy of this TSE as a solid polymer electrolyte in Li-ion batteries, a Li-ion half-cell is assembled employing LiFePO4 coated on aluminium foil (with 5% conductive graphite, 5% acetylene black and 10% PVDF binder) as one electrode (cathode) and Li metal as such as the other (anode),44 with TSE as electrolyte in between using a Swagelok cell setup under nearly zero moisture and oxygen-free atmosphere (&lt;5 ppM).32,33 This half-cell shows an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 2.59 V as shown in Fig. 7D inset, and this cell was able to power up an LED lasting for 5 hours (Fig. 7D inset, green LED). It is important to point out here that neither liquid electrolyte is used at the electrode–electrolyte interface nor the cells are heated, unlike those reported for other SE-based cells to reduce the interfacial resistance.45 The half-cells are cycled for a few hundred cycles at a C/10 rate and the rate performance curve (10th cycle) is displayed in Fig. 7D. The capacity of the cells is found to be of the order of 50 mA h g−1; moreover good cyclability and stability are observed (Table 4).
