Conclusions
This study proposes a novel and generic fabrication approach to construct ion nanochannels with high ion conduction efficiency in the AEM via in situ assembling a poly(ionic liquid) as the ion carrier within the highly ordered pores of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). PIL was robustly and uniformly trapped within the pore lattice structure of MIL-101 by size confinement, and exhibited a low leakage ratio of 0.967% after a 61 day test. Significantly, PIL@MIL shows a high hydroxide conductivity of 36.6 mS cm−1 at a low ion concentration of 0.633 mmol cm−3 (20 °C) due to the structural features of nanochannels within MIL-101 lattice. In particular, the ion transport efficiency in PIL@MIL is up to 36.64%, which is 364% higher and even 113% higher than that in ImPEEK and Nafion, respectively. This is the first exploitation of constructing membranes with efficient ionic nanochannels using MOFs, and the elucidation of the hydroxide ion transport behavior in MOFs. At an application-oriented level, the highly designable nature of MOFs allows for customizing pore morphologies, and the structural diversity of ionic liquids allows a wide selection of ions. Solid electrolytes with target properties can be created by the rational combination of well-designed MOFs as pore lattice matrices and specific ionic liquids as ion carriers, meeting the broad application requirements in the fields such as redox flow cells, lithium batteries, supercapacitors and so forth. At a fundamental level, the high crystallinity and atomic-level visualization of MOFs can initiate further studies in ion conduction mechanisms in solid electrolytes, which is almost unattainable in macromolecular/polymer electrolytes because of the lack of long-range order. Further investigations of these types of MOF membranes are ongoing, aimed at improving their alkaline stability and verifying their practical efficacy in fuel cells.
