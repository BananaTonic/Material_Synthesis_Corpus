3Conclusions
We have developed a promising n-type doping system based on C60 derivative with high performance for organic thermoelectric applications. By rational chemical structure modification of dopant/host materials, we have demonstrated a record power factor of 19.1 μW m−1 K−2 for solution processable C60 derivatives with one of the highest σ of 1.81 S cm−1 to date. Our investigations, including phase imaging AFM measurements and coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations, reveal that introducing the polar TEG side chain into both the dopant and host materials offers a good miscibility of the blend, which accounts for the high doping efficiency of up to 18% at dopant concentration of 20 mol% and thus high carrier density and mobility, which are critical to the electrical conductivity. This work provides a new direction to apply the rapidly developing organic semiconductors with high carrier mobilities to the thermoelectric field.
