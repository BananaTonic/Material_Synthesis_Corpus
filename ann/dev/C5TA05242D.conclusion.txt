4.Conclusions
A new mixture of non-flammable MFE and G2E was investigated as a safe electrolyte for lithium ion batteries. With the help of the FEC additive, this electrolyte could show a good compatibility with the graphite anode. The non-flammability of this electrolyte was proved by the flammability test. The results of the flash point test indicated that the utilization of the solvent with a high flash point was beneficial to retaining the high safety of the electrolyte when reducing the content of HFEs. This electrolyte showed low viscosity, and its conductivity reached 3.8 mS cm−1 at 25 °C. The rate, cycle and low-temperature performances of the graphite/LiFePO4 coin cells using the new electrolyte were close to those of the cells using the conventional electrolytes with and without the FEC additive.
