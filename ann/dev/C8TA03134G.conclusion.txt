4.Conclusion
IGPs have been prepared with polycationic imidazolium or pyrrolidinium scaffolds and LiTFSI solutions in EMI or PMP RTIL as liquid phases, and their dimensional stability, thermal stability, ionic conductivity and ion diffusivity have been studied. IGPs are easy-to-handle solids, thermally stable up to about 200 °C with ionic conductivities ranging from 0.8 mS cm−1, the lowest, to 10 mS cm−1, the highest at 25 °C. The ion diffusivity study shows that IGPs prepared with imidazolium cations in the polymeric scaffold and in the ionic liquid phase have very high D(Li) ≈ 40 × 10−12 m2 s−1, almost double than D(TFSI), at [Li] ≈ 1 mol L−1. In IGPs prepared with pyrrolidinium cations in the scaffold and imidazolium cations in the ionic liquid phase, D(Li) enhancement is slightly lower, and finally in IGPs where pyrrolidinium cations are present in the polymeric scaffold and the ionic liquid phase, the D(Li) enhancement is the smallest.
Though to different extents, in all IGPs it is seen that D(Li) is higher than D(anions), which has been interpreted in terms of a net contribution of the anion exchange Li transport to the overall D(Li), which is higher in IGP containing imidazolium cations and lower in the pyrrolidinium ones. These large D(Li) values at moderate Li concentrations and room temperature, in combination with the safety, easy handling and solid character of the IGPs, plus the appealing combination of high electrochemical stability and large D(Li) in pyrrolidinium ones, make these IGPs very appealing as Li battery solid electrolytes.
