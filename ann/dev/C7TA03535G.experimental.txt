Experimental
Materials
Crystalline graphite powder was purchased from Qingdao JingRiLai graphite co., Ltd. Carboxymethyl cellulose with 800–1200 mPa s was purchased from Aladdin. Manganese(ii) chloride power (≥99% trace metals basis) and 57 wt% hydroiodic acid (HI) were both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Fabrication of the GO–CMC nanocomposites
Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were prepared by the modified Hummers method. Aqueous GO stock dispersion (10 mg mL−1) was mixed with a certain amount of CMC under vigorous stirring for several minutes, followed by a vortex mixer to make composite dispersions or hydrogels. Then, the mixture hydrogel of GO/CMC was transferred into a plastic container at room temperature. After evaporation for several hours, the GO–CMC nanocomposites were obtained.
Fabrication of the rGO–CMC–Mn2+ bioinspired nanocomposites
The obtained GO–CMC nanocomposites were immersed in the manganese(ii) chloride solution at different concentrations for several hours. Then, the GO–CMC–Mn2+ hybrid layered materials were obtained through washing many times with deionized water. After chemical reduction by HI and washing many times with alcohol, the rGO–CMC–Mn2+ bioinspired nanocomposites were obtained.
Characterization
The Shimadzu AGS-X Tester was used to test the mechanical properties with a loading rate of 1 mm min−1 and a gauge length of 5 mm. The samples were cut into strips with width of 3 mm and length of 10 mm. The InstronElectroPuls E1000 test facility was used to conduct the tensile fatigue test at a frequency of 1 Hz, and the samples were cut into strips with width of 5 mm and length of 20 mm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by Quanta 250 FEG and JSM-7500F. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a NETZSCH STA449F3 under nitrogen with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted by a Thermo Nicolet Nexus470 FTIR instrument. All X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an ESCALab220i-XL (Thermo Scientific) by a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using Shimadzu LabX XRD-6000. The electrical conductivity was measured by a standard two-probe method with a source meter (Agilent E4980A).
