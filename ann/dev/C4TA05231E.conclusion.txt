4.Conclusions
A solid solution of the lithium superionic conductor Li10+δGe1+δP2−δS12 (0 ≤ δ ≤ 0.35) was synthesized and its structure and ionic conductivity were determined. An ionic conductivity value of 1.42 × 10−2 S cm−1 was obtained at 300 K for sintered pellets of the sample in which δ = 0.35. The Arrhenius plots of the conductivity show a change in slope at high temperatures, at which the activation energy for ionic conduction decreases to approximately 10 kJ mol−1, which is characteristic of highly ionic conducting solids. The ionic conduction mechanism determined by neutron diffraction measurements indicates a change in the conduction pathway with increasing temperatures, such that a one-dimensional pathway transitions to a three-dimensional mechanism at elevated temperatures. The lithium diffusion pathway visualized through MEM analysis assisted in elucidating the conductivity pathway changes with temperature. The isotropic ionic conducting characteristics of the LGPS structure may mean that related structures of this material are suitable for practical applications in all-solid-state batteries.
