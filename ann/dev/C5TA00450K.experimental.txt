Conductivity modeling
As shown in Fig. 3, the conductivities of the composite samples are low compared to the STN95 values, and appear to be limited by the conductivity of the BCZY27 phase. The STN95 phase in the BS27 SPS-produced composites is likely best represented by the STN95-SPS samples, but even so this only partially explains the overall low conductivity of BS27 composites. Standard effective medium models, such as the Bruggeman–Landauer (BL) and Wu–Liu (WL) models do not accurately predict the experimental data, presumably because they do not account for interfacial effects between the phases or at boundaries of the same phase.
Under hydrogen flux conditions, the BL and WL models seem intuitively appropriate for a composite like BS27, as there are no reports of significant n-type conductivity in BCZY27, nor of any significant protonic conductivity in STN95. However, the disparity between the BS27 data and the models underlines the need for a new effective medium model that includes the option to incorporate a finite, non-zero interfacial conductivity between the two phases, σc, in an attempt to better explain the experimental data. Using eqn (1) as a foundation, an expression that satisfies this condition was recently developed in the context of a composite consisting of two different ionic conductors:204where again, x1 and x2 are the volume fractions of STN95 and BCZY27, respectively, and σ1 and σ2 are the conductivities of STN95 and BCZY27, respectively. This formula is dubbed the interfacial effective medium (IEM) model. In eqn (4), the conductivities σ have the usual units of S cm−1. Note that this definition also holds for σc, which is defined here as:5where GAS (units of S cm−2) is the interfacial area-specific conductance, i.e., the inverse of the contact area-specific resistance (ASRc), and A′ is the amount of contact length between STN95 and BCZY27 phases per unit area of composite (units of cm cm−2, or cm−1). Several factors can be linked to the physical origin of a finite GAS, including structural or chemical inhomogeneities at the heterojunctions, interfacial phase-segregation, or space charge effects. Experimental data can be fitted with this model to extract values of σc, which can then be physically interpreted with the more meaningful terms GAS and A′. For experimental validation of this model, A′ can be determined in a relatively straightforward manner through estimations of contact boundary length from electron micrographs. However, determining GAS experimentally requires careful impedance analysis of a geometrically well-defined interface, e.g., via a cone electrode experiment, as has been done for STN/YSZ junctions,21 or a thin-film model-electrode. Experimental confirmation of GAS was not, however, achieved in the current work.
In Fig. 7, eqn (4) is plotted as a function of STN95 content at 700 °C, for a range of σc values from zero to 10 S cm−1 (solid curves), together with the Bruggeman–Landauer (BL) model (long dash curve) and Wu–Liu (WL) model (short dash curve), and overlaid with the BS27 experimental data (cf.Fig. 3). The IEM curves in Fig. 7 were generated using the STN95-SPS data as the end-member composition. Error bars for the experimental data represent the standard deviation in the measured total conductivity.

The BL curve (long dash) overlays with the IEM model (σc = 10) up to x1 = 0.33, whereupon it tracks with the WL curve (short dash), and is equivalent to solving the IEM model for σc → ∞. The end-member points correspond to the pure BCZY27-CS and STN95-SPS values (cf.Fig. 3). The error bars on the BS27 points represent the standard deviation in the experimental data.
The IEM model of eqn (4) provides a more accurate description of BS27 conductivity, but still does not fully describe the electrical properties of the composite. Given the broad grain size distributions observed in the samples, coupled with the inhomogeneity of the microstructures, the electrical properties of BS27 are non-trivial to simulate. Furthermore, given the dissimilar charge transfer properties of STN95 and BCZY27, the formation of a space charge layer (SCL) at the contacts between the phases cannot be overlooked. SCL theory has been used to describe the electrical properties of junctions or contacts in many materials and devices, particularly in semiconductors22 and in electrolytes or solid-state ionic conductors.23–27 Depending on the type of charge carriers that contribute to the partial currents in a material, SCL can enhance (accumulation scenario) or inhibit (depletion scenario) charge transport in the vicinity of a junction. A definition for the SCL width (δ), adapted from semiconductor theory,28 is presented in eqn (6) in relation to the material properties of STN95 and BCZY27:6where V0 is the built-in voltage between STN95 and BCZY27 junctions, defined by the difference in work functions, q is the fundamental charge, ε0 is permittivity of free space, εH+ is the dielectric constant of BCZY27, εe− is the dielectric constant of STN95, NH+ is the estimated protonic carrier concentration in BCZY27, and Ne− is the estimated n-type electronic carrier concentration in STN95. Values for these quantities, summarized in Table 1, were obtained from the available literature, and from best-guess estimates when supporting information was not found.

The work function of BCZY27 has not been reported in the literature, but, since the material is an acceptor-doped semiconductor-type oxide, Φ is suspected to be moderately large, and was set to 6 eV for the current work. Assuming a 30% protonated BCZY27 phase,9NH+ was determined to be 2.9 × 1020 cm−3, based on lattice volume calculations.
Microwave dielectric research on SrTi1−xNbxO3 (x &lt; 0.01) materials and donor-doped Sr1−xLaxTiO3 was referenced to estimate ε and Φ for STN95.29,30 The dielectric constant of a material similar to STN95, Sr0.94Ti0.9Nb0.1O3−δ (STN94), has been measured to be ∼300 at low and ambient temperatures (−18 to +60 °C), but is not known at higher temperatures, i.e., under the conductivity or hydrogen flux test conditions used in this study. Abrantes et al.31 studied the dielectric properties of undoped SrTiO3 up to 600 °C and reported a value of ∼900 for ε in N2. The carrier concentration of conduction-band electrons in STN95 was taken from the work of Blennow et al.,19 confirming an earlier study by Tomio et al.32 The applicability of the dielectric and work function experiments to STN95 is uncertain at best, given the different electrical properties between undoped and Nb-doped SrTiO3, doping amounts and charge compensation mechanisms, as well as differences in processing routes. To accurately investigate the dielectric properties of STN95 under testing conditions, a network analyzer, which could measure the impedance at gigahertz frequencies, would be required, and such equipment was not available for the current work. Since the conductivity of STN95-SPS is of the order of 10 S cm−1 at 700 °C, a lower value of ε was assumed, in line with the low-temperature measurements on STN94.
An approximate SCL width of 6 nm was calculated from the values in Table 1, utilizing eqn (6). Within the SCL, the carrier concentrations of protons (BCZY27) and electrons (STN95) were assumed to decrease exponentially with distance toward the heterojunction, away from the bulk of the respective phase, according to a Boltzmann approximation.33 Thus, the spatial variation of conductivity with distance across the SCL, σ(x), can be approximated as7where we− and wH+ are the so-called depletion widths on each side of the heterojunction, summing to the total SCL width, and set to δ/2 for these calculations. Inverting eqn (7) and integrating over the total depletion width enables the calculation of an effective area-specific resistance (ASRc) for the interfacial contact region by eqn (8):8Setting eqn (8) equal to (GAS)−1 from eqn (5) links the interfacial conductance directly to the properties of the SCL.
With the SCL thickness calculated from eqn (6), an interfacial conductance (GAS) of 6.1 × 104 S cm−2 was obtained, which, combined with the estimated interfacial length per area of contact between STN95 and BCZY27, A′ (cm−1), was inserted back into eqn (5) to calculate σc, as a check for the IEM model. Values for A′ and calculated σc are given in Table 2 for each BS27 composition.

In addition to the contact resistance between the two phases in the composite, we also speculate that resistive layers may form at STN95 homojunctions during SPS, or during conductivity testing, which would bring down the overall conductivity, thus explaining the remaining overprediction of the IEM model at high STN95 content. This suggested homojunction effect would likely occur in parallel with space charge effects at the heterojunctions, and would dominate at higher STN95 contents as the number of homojunctions increase while the number of heterojunctions decreases. Additionally, charge transfer between the phases may be occurring, and could be attributed to electronic conductivity in the BCZY27 phase promoted by reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ during testing.
The most important conclusion from this study is that the conductivity of BS27, even at 70 volume% STN95, shows temperature-activated behavior similar to the BCZY27 phase, and is restrained to an overall low value, discouraging efforts to optimize its performance as a hydrogen separation membrane, especially in pressure-driven (non-galvanic) configurations.
Hydrogen permeation
The measured hydrogen flux recorded for BS27_5050 indicates moderate performance for a composite cercer material. This performance can be examined in the context of a common model for hydrogen flux in an ambipolar mixed electron–proton conducting membrane where protons are the majority defect:9where R is the universal gas constant (J mol−1 K−1), T is the test temperature (K), σH+ is the protonic conductivity (S cm−1), F is Faraday's constant (C mol−1), L is the membrane thickness (cm), and pH2 is the dimensionless partial pressure of hydrogen. The expression has been modified from a related work34 to include the terms φH+, the volume fraction of the proton-conducting BCZY27 phase, and α, a factor indicating the tortuosity of the BCZY27 phase in the composite. The incorporation of α into flux calculations was recently proposed by Ricote et al. for a two-phase cercer mixed electron–proton conducting composite.35
Eqn (9) is valid for the following conditions: (1) the electronic conductivity is high enough to make the transference number te− unity, (2) protons are the majority defect, and (3) acceptor-dopant ions are the compensating mechanism for the protons. For BS27_5050 φH+ = 0.5, and for this work, α was set to 1.5, based on theoretical treatments of composite fuel cell materials available in the literature.18,36,37Eqn (9) is integrated over a known hydrogen chemical potential gradient, the driving force for hydrogen flux, from pH2,I (high) to pH2,II (low), hence the need for the negative sign at the front to generate a positive value. For a protonic conductivity of 2.8 mS cm−1 (corresponding to the value measured for BCZY27 at 600 °C in Fig. 3) and setting pH2,II to the value of the leak, eqn (9) produces a value of 0.0172 μmol cm−2 s−1, roughly five times greater than the measured value of 0.0035 μmol cm−2 s−1 for BS27_5050 at 600 °C when dry argon was used as the sweep. It should be noted that increasing α to 7 (all else the same) produces a predicted flux of 0.0036 μmol cm−2 s−1, suggesting a strong dependence on microstructure.
Comparing the results of plain BS27_5050 (no Pd layers) to other hydrogen separation membrane research, a recent study on Ca-doped LaNbO4/LaNb3O9 composite cercer membranes prepared by SPS reported hydrogen flux values an order of magnitude lower than BS27_5050 under the same test conditions.38 The permeative flux for BS27_5050 is comparable to values reported for single-phase membranes such as Y-doped SrCeO3,39 Eu-doped SrCeO3,40,41 and Mo-substituted lanthanum tungstate (La27Mo1.5W3.5O55.5).42 However, the performance does not match that of ceramic–metal (cermet) composites such as Ni–BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ (ref. 43) and Ni–BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3−δ,44 as well as of another recently-studied cercer, La5.5WO11.25−δ/La0.87Sr0.13CrO3−δ (LWO–LSC).45 The application of Pd layers to a BS27_5050 sample improved the hydrogen flux performance by a factor of 4–7 across the temperature range investigated. Yet, even the best performance at 700 °C still falls roughly an order of magnitude short of the 1 mL cm−2 min−1 (0.74 μmol cm−2 s−1) benchmark desired for commercial applications.1
The TGA experiments suggest STN95 does not significantly oxidize in the presence of a moist Ar atmosphere at high temperature. Based on the calculation of incorporated oxygen from the 0.05% weight gain, and assuming a classical relationship between carrier concentration and conductivity, 11% of Ti3+ ions becoming oxidized cannot account for the precipitous drop in total conductivity. Rather, it is likely that the reduction in n-type conductivity is caused by Sr-vacancies becoming a majority defect compensation mechanism in moderately oxidizing environments, which has been reported in the literature.19,32,46 The presence of H2 in the sweep, whether by leak or intentional addition, maintained the conductivity of STN95 in the 102 S cm−1 range, which seems to have a beneficial impact on the permeation performance, and indicates that maintaining a reducing environment on both sides of the BS27 membrane is crucial. Since leak-free testing was not achieved, the effect of adding small partial pressures of H2 to the sweep could not be determined.
Based on the microstructural investigations of the three BS27 compositions, it appears the BCZY27 phase is isolated and non-percolating in the 60 and 70 volume% STN95 samples, hence the lack of measured hydrogen flux for these compositions. The isolation of the BCZY27 phase is thought to be due to insufficient mixing of the powders during synthesis. The phenomenon may also be attributed to the non-homogenous sintering conditions inherent to SPS, e.g., radial temperature gradients in the sample causing the STN95 and BCZY27 phases to sinter differently. The end result is that the protonic transport pathways are severely limited in BS27_4060 and BS27_3070 samples, effectively eliminating any hydrogen flux potential. While increasing STN95 content improved total conductivity by 5–10× at permeation testing temperatures, the hydrogen permeability was nullified, indicating the BCZY27 phase is rate-limiting for this membrane material.
