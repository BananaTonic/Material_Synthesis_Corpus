Experimental
Synthesis of MIL-101
MIL-101 was prepared by modifying a previously reported method.32 The mixture of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (2.0 g, 5 mmol), terephthalic acid (0.83 g, 5 mmol), and deionized water (20 mL) was placed in a Teflon-lined autoclave bomb and kept in an oven at 180 °C for 20 h without stirring. The resulting solid was washed with distilled water and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dried at room temperature under ambient atmosphere. For incorporating HPWs into both types of cages in MIL-101 (3 and 3′), HPW (2 g, 0.7 mmol for 3 and 1.6 g, 0.6 mmol for 3′) was added into the mixture, and the pH value was adjusted to 3 using 1 M aqueous NaOH, while the other reaction conditions were the same. Elemental analysis (wt%) for 3: Cr, 7.23; W, 34.8. For 3′: Cr, 8.82; W, 31.8. The as-prepared materials were degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h before further treatment.
Impregnation of HPWs into the larger cages of MIL-101 (1)
Herein, 2 g of dry MIL-101 synthesized in an autoclave as abovementioned was suspended in an aqueous solution of HPW (1.0 g in 20 mL). The suspension was stirred at ambient temperature for 2 days. The solids were separated by centrifugation, repeatedly washed with water, and dried under vacuum. Elemental analysis (wt%): Cr, 9.72; W, 21.3.
Immobilization of HPWs in the smaller cages of MIL-101 (2 and 2′)
A sample of 3 and 3′ (100 mg) was soaked in 100 mL of water for 1 h. Then, the solid was filtered off and soaked in 100 mL of water for 1 h again, and this process was repeated until there was almost no HPW in the filtrate. The upper clear solution was taken out for UV-vis absorbance measurement (solution was diluted with deionized water if the peak signal exceeded the detection limit of the instrument). Elemental analysis (wt%) for 2: Cr, 8.92; W, 24.0. For 2′: Cr, 9.40; W, 20.3.
Flexible polyamine molecules loading inside 3 (polyamines@3) and MIL-101 (TETA@MIL-101)
Polyamines@3 was prepared by modifying a previously reported method.33 The as-prepared 3 (1.0 g) was suspended in anhydrous toluene (30 mL). To this suspension, 2.2 mmol of ethylenediamine (EN), diethylenetriamine (DETA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) were separately added, and the mixture was stirred with heating to reflux for 12 h. Then, a drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to this suspension during the reflux process. The addition amount of polyamines was calculated by the quantity of potential coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUSs, 1.5 mmol g−1) and HPW (83.9 wt%) in 3. For 4/2TETA@3 and 1/2TETA@3, 4.2 mmol and 1.2 mmol of TETA were added into the mixture, respectively, while the other reaction conditions were the same. For TETA@MIL-101, the synthetic method is the same as that of TETA@3, in which the as-prepared MIL-101 was used instead of 3.
Synthesis of HPW/TETA (PT)
TETA was added into a solution containing HPW (1 g, 0.35 mmol) and water (20 mL), and white product PT was quickly precipitated from the solution with the addition of TETA.
Characterization
UV-vis spectrum was obtained using a Mapada UV-vis-6100PC UV-vis spectrometer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out in the range of 400–4000 cm−1via an Alpha Centaurt FTIR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed using a Rigaku D/MAX-3 instrument with Cu Kα radiation in the angular 2θ range of 3–15° at 293 K. Elemental analyses for Cr and W were determined using a Leaman inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. EDX spectrum was obtained by TEAM EDS (EDAX, USA) using a HITACHI SU8010 SEM. Nitrogen sorption measurements were performed at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) after dehydration under vacuum at 393 K for 12 h using a Hiden isochema IGA 100B instrument. Pore size distribution curves were calculated by the adsorption branch of the isotherms via the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) and Horvath–Kawazoe method using an automatic micropore and mesopore analyzer ASAP 2020M; pore sizes were obtained from the peak positions of the distribution curves.
AC impedance measurements
AC impedance measurements of the samples were performed using a PARSTAT 2273 (AMETEK Instruments, USA) electrochemical workstation, and the temperature and relative humidity were controlled using an HDHWHS-50 incubator. Impedance analyses were performed on the powders of the samples. The powders were pressed to discs under a pressure of 10 MPa for 1 minute. The samples used for the measurement had a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 3.0 ± 0.2 mm. The samples were sandwiched between two copper electrodes. Measurements were performed over the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz with the input voltage amplitude of 150 mV. Each conductivity measurement was conducted after 4 hours under the target condition (temperature and relative humidity).
