2.1Materials
Polysulfone (PSF, Udel 3500): Amoco Performance Product Inc. Chloromethyl octyl ether (CMOE) was synthesized according to the literature.19 Hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), potassium hydroxide (KOH), benzyl chloride, concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), cyclohexane, stannic chloride (SnCl4), chloroform (CHCl3), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and anhydrous ethanol were obtained commercially and used as received without further purification. All the chemicals used were of analytical grade. Deionized water, which had been previously boiled to remove CO2, was used throughout this study.
2.2Preparation of HMTA mono-quaternized polysulfone membranes (PSF-QuOH)
Chloromethylated polysulfone (CMPSF) was prepared by dissolving 10 g PSF in 250 mL CH2Cl2 with stirring, then mixing with 60 mL CMOE and 3 mL SnCl4 at 35 °C for 5–60 min, precipitating with ethanol and drying at room temperature overnight. Then, 5 g CMPSF in 10 mL CHCl3 and excessive amount of HMTA in 20 mL CHCl3 (molar ratio of –CH2Cl to HMTA is about 1 : 5 to avoid crosslinking by HMTA) were mixed and stirred at 40 °C with reflux. Then the product HMTA mono-quaternized polysulfone materials (PSF-QuCl) were precipitated from CHCl3, dissolved in NMP and re-precipitated with ethanol to remove the unreacted HMTA.
HMTA mono-quaternized polysulfone membranes (PSF-QuOH) were obtained by dissolving the PSF-QuCl materials in NMP, casting onto the glass plate, drying in an oven at 60 °C for 48 h and in a vacuum oven for another 12 h. Then the membranes were immersed in 1 M KOH for 2 days and washed with freshly deionized water until neutral in sealed containers (as shown in Fig. 1). For convenience, the membranes in the OH− form are denoted as PSF-QuOH xx, where xx is the IEC value of the PSF-QuOH membrane.
2.3Synthesis of the model compound
A model compound, benzylhexamethylenetetrammonium chloride (BHMTA), was prepared to determine the chemical shifts of PSF-QuCl in 1H NMR. In particular, BHMTA was synthesized according to Scheme 1 by dissolving benzyl chloride (10 mL) and HMTA (1.8 g) in ethanol (15 mL) at 40 °C, stirring for 12 h with reflux, collecting the white solid and washing it with ethanol for purification.20

2.4Characterization of the membranes
1H NMR was used to determine the chemical structures of the model compound BHMTA and PSF-QuCl with a Varian Unity Inova 500 spectrometer, using DMSO-d6 to dissolve materials and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA851e TGA analyzer. Samples were heated from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Mechanical properties of the fully hydrated membranes were measured using a SANS CMT8102 stretching tester (Xinsansi Co., China) at a stretch rate of 5 mm min−1.
Ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the PSF-QuOH membranes was measured by back titration. The dry PSF-QuOH membranes were immersed in 25 mL of 0.01 mol L−1 HCl solution for 24 h, and then back titrated with 0.01 mol L−1 NaOH using phenolphthalein as an indicator. Each sample was tested three times. The measured IEC (IECm) was calculated using:1where C1 and C2 are the concentrations of HCl and NaOH solutions, respectively; V1 and V2 are the volumes of HCl and NaOH solutions, respectively; m is the weight of the dry membranes.
The PSF-QuOH membranes were soaked in deionized water for 12 h at different temperatures, and then dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The weight and dimension of the hydrated and dry membranes were recorded. Each sample was tested three times. The water uptake and swelling ratio were calculated as:23where Wdry and Wwet are the weights of the dry and hydrated membranes, respectively; Ldry and Lwet are the average lengths of the dry and hydrated membranes, Ldry = (Ldry1 × Ldry2)1/2, Lwet = (Lwet1 × Lwet2)1/2,15Ldry1, Ldry2 and Lwet1, Lwet2 are the lengths and the widths of the dry and hydrated membranes.
Hydroxide conductivity was measured in water using a typical four-electrode AC impedance analyzer (Ivium Technologies A08001). The testing procedure was conducted in galvanostatic mode with a current amplitude of 0.1 mA over a frequency range of 1–105 Hz. The membrane resistance was obtained from a Nyquist plot. Each sample was tested three times. The hydroxide conductivity was calculated using the equation:4where A is the cross-sectional area of the membranes, L is the distance between the two potential electrodes, and R is the membrane resistance.
Chemical stability was investigated by immersion of the membranes into 1 M KOH solution at 60 °C and 4 M NaOH at 80 °C for different times, washing with deionized water and measuring their hydroxide conductivities at 30 °C. FTIR analysis was also used to further confirm the chemical structures of the membranes before and after alkali treatment. The degradation mechanism of the model compound BHMTA was investigated by 1H NMR. Specifically, BHMTA (0.05 M), NaOH (1 M), CD3OD and D2O were added into the NMR tube at room temperature.21,22 After a certain time, the solution was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
2.5Model constructions and simulation details
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the PSF-QuOH and imidazolium quaternized polysulfone (PSF-ImOH) membranes were carried out to investigate the mechanism of swelling resistance.23 DREIDING and F3C force field were used to describe the polymers and water, respectively.24,25 The AEMs were simulated in the dry and hydrated states (water uptake ∼ 20%) at 60 °C. IEC values are about 1.78 and 1.67 mmol g−1 for the PSF-ImOH and PSF-QuOH, respectively. The models in this work comprise five polymer chains, and each chain is composed of 10 functionalized repeat units. The atomistic structures were treated by an annealing procedure to fully equilibrate the amorphous cells.26,27 The simulated density of the fully hydrated PSF-QuOH is 1.11 g cm−3, well coincident with the experimental value of 1.06 g cm−3. The radial distribution function (RDF), g(r), indicates the local probability density of finding B atoms at a distance r from A atoms. Its corresponding coordination number (CN) is calculated by integrating RDF and reveals the number of B atoms around A atoms. RDF and CN within a given radius shell are obtained using the following equations:56where nB(r) is the number of B atoms within a distance r of a central A atom, and ρB represents the bulk number density of B atoms.23,28
