Conclusions
Substitution of Ce/Zr cations with Pr in the technologically relevant BaZr0.7Ce0.2Y0.1O3−δ perovskite leads to enhanced electronic conductivity, desired for membrane and fuel-cell cathode applications. The BaZr0.7Ce0.2Y0.1O3−δ–BaPr0.9Y0.1O3−δ system forms a complete solid solution, exhibiting symmetry changes in the sequence Pnma → Imma →  → Pm3̄m. Higher symmetry is favoured for lower Pr content and higher temperature, as expected from tolerance-factor considerations. The exclusive presence of Pr on the B site in the IV oxidation state is confirmed by magnetic measurements. Increasing electrical transport with increasing Pr content is thus ascribed to small polaronic hopping in the oxygen band rather than mixed Pr valence states. The Pr concentration is highly influential on the charge-compensation mechanism adopted for the Y acceptor dopant. For lower Pr contents, formation of oxygen vacancies as occurs for the BZCY72 end-member is favoured; however, for higher Pr concentrations electron–hole formation is predominant. Refinement of neutron-diffraction data supports a model for the high Pr-content compositions of filled nominal oxygen sites, with concomitant formation of holes. Conversely, low Pr content is associated with transport behavior more similar to that of the BZCY72 end-member phase, with higher conductivity exhibited in humidified in comparison to dry N2 and contraction of unit-cell parameter on heating attributable to dehydration.
