2.2Techniques &amp; procedures
2.2.1Structural battery electrolyte (SBE) preparation
A series of different SBE samples with different compositions were prepared as listed in Table 1. All samples were prepared in a glovebox, under an argon atmosphere and dry conditions (&lt;1 ppm H2O, &lt;1 ppm O2). A stock solution of liquid electrolyte was mixed and used in all the prepared SBEs. EC was heated to roughly 40 °C and mixed with DMMP ((50 : 50) wt%). LiTFS was then dissolved until a concentration of 1.0 M was reached. The liquid electrolyte was then mixed with monomer A and/or B and the UV-initiator, DMPA, in the amounts listed in Table 1.

The sample mixtures were then transferred to an aluminum mold (30 × 6 × 0.6 mm) and UV-cured, with a total dose of 1.2 J cm−2. Samples containing monomer B were cured at ambient temperature while samples consisting solely of monomer A were UV-cured at approximately 60 °C, to prevent monomer A from recrystallizing. A Blak Ray B100-AP (100 W, 365 nm) Hg UV lamp with an intensity of 5.2 mW cm−2 was used as a light source for 4 minutes. The intensity was determined with a Uvicure Plus High Energy UV Integrating Radiometer (EIT, USA), measuring UVA at 320–390 nm.
2.2.2Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)
To measure the conversion of the reaction, FT-IR analysis was performed on the sample mixture prior to curing and on the cured SBE films. A PerkinElmer Spectrum 2000 FT-IR instrument equipped with a single reflection ATR (attenuated total reflection) accessory unit, with a diamond ATR crystal (Golden gate) from Graseby Specac Ltd. was used for the analysis. 16 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1 were performed for each spectrum. The conversion of the acrylate groups in the samples was calculated from the disappearance of the vinyl stretching peak at 1637 cm−1. The carbonyl peak of the ester group at 1715 cm−1 was used as an internal reference peak. The lithium salt/solvent mixture, as-prepared SBEs, and washed and dried SBEs were also analyzed using FTIR in order to evaluate the washing process.
2.2.3Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
SEM was performed to examine the microstructure and differences in the phase separation of the SBEs. The cross-sections on the cured SBE films were examined using a Hitachi S-4800 equipped with a cold field-emission electron source. All samples were immersed in water (minimum 24 h) to extract LiTFS and EC : DMMP. The samples were then dried in a vacuum oven; afterwards, they were weighed to determine the mass loss before studying them under the SEM. The samples were cooled in liquid nitrogen and then fractured to expose the cross-section. The fractured samples were coated with Pt/Pd using an Agar HR sputter coater; a sputtered layer thickness of 3 nm was chosen.
2.2.4Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
DMA measurements were performed to characterize the mechanical properties using a TA Instruments DMA Q800 in tensile mode. The SBE films were clamped in the DMA with a length of 10–15 mm between the clamps. The starting temperature was set to 25 °C where it was held isothermally for 10 min, before increasing it at a rate of 3 °C min−1 to 150 °C. An amplitude between 10–15 μm was applied (0.1% of the sample length).
2.2.5Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
EIS was used to measure the ionic conductivity at ambient and elevated temperatures. The measurement was performed on SBE films inside the glovebox directly after curing using a Gamry Series G 750 Potentiostat/Galvanostat/ZRA interface. A four-point electrode type cell was used with gold wires as electrodes, two working electrodes (20 mm apart) and two reference electrodes (5 mm apart). A conventional convection oven was used for the measurement of the conductivity at elevated temperatures. The impedance was measured in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 300 kHz, with an amplitude of 10 mV. The bulk resistance (Rb) was obtained from the low-frequency intercept with the real axis in the resulting Nyquist plot. The ionic conductivity was calculated using the following equation, σ = l/(Rb × A), were σ is the ionic conductivity, l is the length between the reference electrodes (5 mm), Rb is the bulk resistance and A is the cross-sectional area of the sample. The thickness and width of each sample were measured with a digital slide caliper.
2.2.6Half-cell production with carbon fiber electrodes
To prepare a carbon fiber lamina half-cell a tow of carbon fibers (6000 fibers) was spread to approximately 10 mm width and 0.05 mm thickness on a glass slide with dimensions of 150 × 70 mm. The tow was fixed with tape to the glass surface and a copper foil current collector was attached to one of the ends of the carbon fiber tow with Electrolube silver conductive paint. The carbon fibers were then covered with one layer of release film (perforated polyethylene film), peel-ply (nylon fabric treated with a release agent) and breather (distribution medium of coarse polyester felt cloth). The samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. The layup was then sealed using a vacuum bag and rubber tape, and placed inside a glovebox in a dry argon atmosphere (&lt;1 ppm H2O, &lt;1 ppm. O2). The SBE solution AB/0.65 was infused into the mould under vacuum. The curing procedure from Section 2.2.1 was repeated. The resulting carbon fiber lamina was removed from the vacuum equipment and directly inserted into a two-electrode pouch cell. Lithium metal foil was used as the counter electrode and a Whatman glass-microfiber filter was used as a separator between the electrodes. Small amounts of 1 M LiTFS in EC : DMMP were used to guarantee contact between the lithium metal foil and the carbon fiber lamina half-cell.
2.2.7Galvanostatic cycling of the half-cell
The electrochemical capacity of the structural lamina half-cell was measured by galvanostatic cycling between 0.002 V and 1.5 V vs. Li/Li+ over 10 cycles. The applied current was set to C/20 with respect to the theoretical capacity of graphite (372 mA h g−1), which results in an approximate current of 0.16 mA. A second test series at C/5 was also performed over 50 cycles.
2.2.8Mechanical testing of the half-cell
The elastic modulus of the half-cell was measured in the transverse direction to fibers, which is a matrix dominated property. This was done using a three-point bending set-up. However, since the half-cell laminae are very thin (approx. 0.05 mm), the tests were performed by bonding the lamina to a substrate (a 0.13 mm PET film) and measuring the bending stiffness of the assembly and then back-calculating the modulus of the half-cell lamina. This was also done for a SBE molded into a thin film (0.1 mm).
