Preparation and characterization of the Na+ ion ceramic/polymer composite solid electrolyte
The NASICON structured Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and Na3.4Zr1.8Mg0.2Si2PO12 solid electrolyte was synthesized by a sol–gel method. Firstly, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethanol and H2O were mixed at a molar ratio of 1 : 10 : 20. An appropriate amount of citric acid was added and the mixture was stirred at 60 °C. Secondly, NaNO3, ZrO(NO3)2 and Mg(NO3)2 were dissolved in deionized water and added to the previous solution. Finally, (NH4)2HPO4 aqueous solution was added and a clear collosol was obtained. The collosol was heated at 80 °C to get a gel. The obtained precursor was first sintered at 900 °C for 24 h. After a second mixing, the sintered powder was pressed to sample discs (diameter 13 mm, thickness 1 mm) and calcined at 1100–1200 °C for 24 h. The resulting ceramic disk was crushed and ground into powder for use.
The ceramic/polymer composite electrolyte was prepared from PEO, NaFSI, and Na3Zr2Si2PO12/Na3.4Zr1.8Mg0.2Si2PO12 ceramic powder by using the solution-casting technique. The PEO polymer (Mw = 600 000) and sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (NaFSI) were dried at 50 °C and 60 °C, respectively, in a vacuum oven for 24 h before use. PEO, as the matrix, and NaFSI, as the sodium salt to give an [EO] : [Na] ratio of 12 : 1, were weighed and dissolved in anhydrous acetonitrile in a glovebox. The above mixture was sealed in a bottle and stirred at 60 °C for 24 h. Afterwards, Na3Zr2Si2PO12/Na3.4Zr1.8Mg0.2Si2PO12, as a sodium ion conducting ceramic filler, was added and the solution was mixed by ball milling for 12 h. The resulting viscous solution was then cast onto a Teflon plate and the solvent was left to evaporate slowly at room temperature. The obtained film was finally dried at 60 °C in a high vacuum oven for 24 h to remove all the residual solvent. The final films with a thickness of 200–400 μm were yielded.
XRD patterns of the ceramic electrolytes were collected on a D8 Bruker ASX D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation at a scan rate of 1° min−1. TG measurements were conducted on a Netzsch STA 449C differential scanning calorimeter in an Ar atmosphere at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 150 °C.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments were performed to investigate the electrochemical window of the ceramic/polymer composite electrolytes with stainless steel as the working electrode and sodium foil as the counter electrode, at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 and 60 °C.
The cross-sectional morphology of the composite electrolytes was observed on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The elemental distribution was calculated using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
The ionic conductivity of the ceramic/polymer composite electrolytes was measured using an impedance analyzer (Im6e) in a frequency range of 4 MHz to 100 mHz from 20 °C to 100 °C. The composite electrolyte films were cut into discs and sandwiched between two blocking stainless steel electrodes. For conductivity tests at each temperature, the samples were allowed to equilibrate for 4 h prior to measurements.
Electrochemical test
The cathode slurry was prepared by mixing the synthesized carbon coated (5 wt%) Na3V2(PO4)3, Na3.4Zr1.8Mg0.2Si2PO12 ceramic powder, super P and PVDF binder in a weight ratio of 65 : 20 : 5 : 10. The slurry was then coated onto an aluminum foil and dried in a vacuum at 120 °C for 12 h. The cathode films were cut into 0.64 cm2 (0.8 cm × 0.8 cm). Solid-state Na3V2(PO4)3/CPE/Na and Na3V2(PO4)3/SPE/Na cells were then assembled by sandwiching the CPE and SPE, respectively, between the Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode and Na anode. All the cells are assembled in 2032-type coin-type cells in an argon filled glovebox ([H2O] &lt; 0.1 ppm, [O2] &lt; 0.1 ppm). The charge/discharge tests of the cells were performed between 2.5 V and 3.8 V. The mass loading of the cathode is about 2.5 mg cm−2.
