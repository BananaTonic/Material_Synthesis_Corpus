Summary and conclusions
The present study developed a solvent-free technique for synthesizing an SPE-(PEO-A):IL, which comprised PEO-based polymer chains cross-linked by bisphenol-A segments and which was incorporated with EMImTFSI as the charge carrier. The ether-abundant cross-linked polymer framework exhibited excellent mechanical strength and a high capacity for EMImTFSI. The SPE-(PEO-A):IL presented ionic conductivity and a stable voltage window similar to neat EMImTFSI. In the assembly of the EDLCs, the solvent-free synthesis was conducted directly on the porous carbon electrodes to form the SPE-(PEO-A):IL with complete penetration into the pores. The intimate integration of the SPE-(PEO-A):IL and electrodes rendered the EDLC-SPE-(PEO-A):IL as efficient as liquid-state EDLC-EMImTFSI in terms of charge storage. Although it slightly impeded ion transportation across the carbon film, the (PEO-A) polymer network also facilitated the dissociation of the [EMIm]+[TFSI]− ion pair to increase the ultimate capacitance of the electrodes. Additionally, the EDLC-SPE-(PEO-A):IL delivered a maximum Ecell of 41.2 W h kg−1 and a maximum Pcell of 12.3 kW kg−1 for operation within a 0–3 V window, outperforming other reported EDLCs fabricated using IL-based SPEs. Finally, the EDLC-SPE-(PEO-A):IL was flexible and exhibited similar charge storage behaviors when bent within 0–90°. This unique solvent-free synthesis strategy for SPEs is also facile and environmentally friendly, and the direct polymerization of an SPE on the electrode is scalable and would substantially simplify the assembly process of flexible EDLCs. In short, our work has paved a new way forward for fabricating solid-state energy storage devices.
