Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that the dopant utilised to stabilise the cubic phase of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) also plays a pivotal role in the formation and propagation of dendrites, and therefore it is directly related to the critical current density for dendrite formation in LLZO/Li metal-based cells. By using FIB-SIMS, the chemical composition of the dendritic-like features in both Al-LLZO and Ga-LLZO was analysed, revealing them to be Al- and Li-rich in Al-LLZO, whereas in Ga-LLZO they are uniquely composed of Li species. This could be ascribed to the fact that, unlike the Ga, the Al segregates between the grains in Al-LLZO and may facilitate the initial propagation of lithium in the grain boundaries leading to a critical current density as low as 0.1 mA cmâˆ’2. This has a critical impact on the choice of dopants for the stabilisation of cubic garnet electrolytes with high Li-conductivity and their processing to avoid Al-contamination representing an important step forward towards understanding dendrite formation and its suppression.
