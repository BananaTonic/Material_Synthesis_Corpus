Conclusions
In summary, a novel 3D cross-linked network PEO@nano-SiO2 composite polymer electrolyte was successfully synthesized by an initiator-free one-pot synthesis strategy on a ring-opening polymerization reaction. Grafted nano-SiO2 acted as cross-linking agents and fillers to enhance the strength and flexibility of the polymer network, which made the novel 3D-GCPE exhibit excellent electrochemical stability. With a small amount of Î³-GPS grafted nano-SiO2 introduced, the electrochemical window of 3D-GCPE4 was widened to 5.4 V with higher tLi+. When the 3D-GCPE4 cooperated with LiFePO4, the cells delivered excellent cycling performance, more importantly, when it cooperated with 4.5 V high-voltage cathode NCM811 and 4.9 V high-voltage cathode LNMO, it can also exhibit stable performance. In addition, this polymer electrolyte may obtain a better high voltage cycling performance if carbonic ester is replaced with ionic liquid. This work provides an advanced strategy to improve the electrochemical stability of polymer electrolytes and facilitate the progress of high-voltage electrolytes.
