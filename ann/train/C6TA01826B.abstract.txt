Infiltrated porous oxide monoliths as high lithium transference number electrolytesElectronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c6ta01826b
We show for the first time that liquid–solid lithium electrolytes can exhibit both a very high lithium transference number (up to 0.89) and high overall ionic conductivity (up to 0.48 mS cm−1) when the solid contains a large number of mesopores covered by a high density of –OH groups enabling anionic adsorption.
