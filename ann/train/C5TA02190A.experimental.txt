Synthesis of the 3DOM Nafion/Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 scaffolds
Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) spheres with uniform size distribution were prepared via the reported emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization30 and used as the template for the synthesis of 3DOM Nafion/Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 scaffolds. To prepare the Nafion/Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 solution, Nafion solution (DE520, 5 wt% in isopropyl alcohol, Dupont) was first mixed with 0, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 wt% phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40·nH2O, HPW, Sigma-Aldrich). After mixing, cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, Sigma-Aldrich) was introduced into the mixture in a stoichiometric ratio, followed by stirring for 30 min. After ion exchange, the content of Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 (CsHPW) in Nafion/CsHPW solutions was 5, 10 and 15 wt%, respectively. The Nafion/CsHPW dispersion was then infused into the PMMA template via vacuum assisted impregnation. After impregnation, the composite was annealed at 100 °C for 3 h, 130 °C for 1 h, 140 °C for 1 h and 150 °C for 1 h, sequentially. The PMMA template was then removed by incubation of the annealed composite in chloroform for 24 h. The obtained Nafion/CsHPW nanocomposites with 5, 10 and 15% CsHPW were then dried and stored.
Preparation of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA)
The MEA was fabricated through a catalyst coated membrane (CCM) method. The catalyst slurry was prepared as follows. Pt/C catalysts (1 g, 60 wt% Pt/C, Johnson Matthey) were mixed with 13 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring. Then, 6.7 mL Nafion solution or 0.335 g Nafion/CsHPW was added to the mixture, followed by ultrasonic treatment for 30 min and high-speed homogenization for 1 h to form the catalyst slurry. The catalyst slurry was then applied to PTFE film by spraying, dried at 90 °C in a N2 atmosphere for 5 min, and transferred onto the Nafion 211 proton exchange membrane as the cathodic catalyst layer. The anodic catalyst layer was prepared by the conventional method, using a Pt/C catalyst with 5 wt% Nafion as the binder, followed by transfer to the Nafion membrane as the anodic catalyst layer. The catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) was then formed at 125 °C under 10 MPa for 90 s. The Pt loading, which was controlled by weighing during MEA fabrication, was 0.15 mg cm−2 for the anode and 0.25 mg cm−2 for the cathode. Finally, the gas diffusion layers (TGP-060, Toray Inc.) were placed on the anode and cathode side of the CCM to form the membrane electrode assembly (MEA).
Characterization
The morphology of the 3DOM Nafion/CsHPW nanocomposite was characterized by SEM (Hitachi S-4800 FE-SEM) with an accelerating voltage of 3–5 kV. The samples were sputtered with a thin layer of gold before SEM measurements. TEM images of the 3DOM Nafion/CsHPW were obtained using a Hitachi H7600 TEM with an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. FTIR spectra of the composites were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer GX Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the range of 2000–400 cm−1 at a resolution of 2 cm−1. The electrochemical performance of the MEA assembled with the cathodic 3DOM Nafion/CsHPW catalyst layer was examined with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements using an Autolab PG30/FRA, Netherlands. EIS was performed in the frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz at a signal amplitude of 10 mV. CV measurements were performed between −0.3 and 0.9 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in 0.1 M HClO4. A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode and platinum wire was used as the counter electrode. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was fabricated with either a 60% Pt/C catalyst or a 3DOM Nafion/CsHPW supported Pt/C catalyst as the cathode catalyst. The MEA was mounted in a single cell test fixture with a serpentine flow field and a fuel cell clamp with two heating sheets on both sides. The active area of the single cell was 25 cm2. The single cell performance was evaluated on a G50 fuel cell test station (Greenlight) using H2 (s = 1.5) as the fuel and air (s = 2.5) as the oxidant at 80 °C. The RH value of H2 was set at 100% by slowly flowing water vapour saturated at a controlled dew point. No external humidification was applied for air. No back pressure was applied during the test. The mass activity of the catalyst was determined by the method described by Gasteiger et al.31,32
