Conclusions
Spindle-like porous carbon dispersed MnO nanocrystals were synthesized through the hydrothermal method and cationic vacancies were introduced by the incomplete reduction of high valence state Mn(iii). A moderate calcination temperature of 600 °C was found to be effective for the fabrication of samples with a low degree of crystallinity. This benefits the phase transition in conversion reactions and the porous carbon matrix further facilitates charge transfer and penetration of electrolyte into the material. The synergistic combination of these three factors endows the resulting samples with enhanced capacity and cyclability. The Li-ion pseudo-capacitor with the spindle MnO as an anode and AC as a cathode offers a significantly high energy density of 220 W h kg−1, comparable to that of Li-ion batteries, with little degradation over 3600 cycles.
