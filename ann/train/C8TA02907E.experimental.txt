Experimental
Precursor synthesis and powder production
Sodium propionate [NaO2CCH2CH3] was synthesized by reacting sodium hydroxide (80 g, 2 mol) with propionic acid (445 g, 6 mol) in a 1 L round bottom flask equipped with a still head at 130 °C in N2 atmosphere. Once transparent liquid was obtained, heat was removed and sodium propionate crystallized on cooling which was filtered off. Magnesium propionate [Mg(O2CCH2CH3)2] was synthesized by reacting magnesium hydroxide (58 g, 1 mol) with propionic acid (445 g, 6 mol), following the same procedure. Alumatrane [Al(OCH2CH2)3N], titanatrane {Ti(OCH2CH2)3N–[OCH2CH2N(CH2CH2OH)2]}, and zirconium isobutyrate {Zr[O2CCH–(CH3)2]2(OH)2} were synthesized as described in previous work.30–32
Sodium propionate, alumatrane, and magnesium propionate were dissolved in ethanol at a selected molar ratios to result in Na1.67Al10.33Mg0.67O17 (NAMO) composition with 50 wt% excess sodium. The precursor solution with 3 wt% ceramic loading was aerosolized and combusted to generate nanoparticles using the liquid-feed flame spray pyrolysis (LF-FSP) apparatus.30–34 Nanopowders of TiO2 and ZrO2 were also prepared, by aerosol combustion of titanatrane and zirconium isobutyrate, respectively.
Powder and film processing
All as-produced nanopowders (NPs) were dispersed in EtOH (200 proof, Decon Labs) with 4 wt% bicine (Sigma-Aldrich) dispersant, using an ultrasonic horn (Vibra cell VC-505, Sonics and Materials, Inc.) at 100 W for 10 min. After 4 h of settling, the supernatant was decanted and dried. TiO2 and ZrO2 at selected wt% were added to the NAMO NPs during suspension formulation. Table 1 lists target compositions of the mixed NP systems used here.

All components were added to a 20 ml vial and ball-milled with 3.0 mm diameter spherical ZrO2 beads for 24 h to homogenize the suspension. Suspensions were cast using a wire wound rod coater (Automatic Film Applicator-1137, Sheen Instrument, Ltd.). Dried green films were manually peeled off the Mylar substrate, cut to selected sizes, and thermo-compressed at 80–100 °C with a pressure of 30–40 MPa for 5 min using a heated bench top press (Carver, Inc.) to improve packing density.

Symmetrical cell construction
Symmetric cells (Na/NAMO/Na) were assembled in a fume hood under N2 flow as a semi-inert environment. Before cell assembly, the metallic Na was scraped to expose a clean surface. Na was pressed between Mylar sheets to produce smooth and flat surfaces (0.64 cm2 × 0.6 mm thick). After removing the Mylar, the Na component was rinsed briefly in methanol and hexane solutions. Symmetrical cells were constructed using a standard procedure.
Characterization
X-Ray diffraction measurements were carried out using a Rigaku Rotating Anode Goniometer. Scans were made from 5 to 70° 2θ, using Cu Kα radiation (1.541 Å) operating at 40 kV and 100 mA. The Jade program 2010 (Materials Data, Inc.) was used for analysis.
Specific surface areas (SSAs) were obtained using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 sorption analyser. Samples (300 mg) were degassed at 200 °C/5 h. Each analysis was run at −196 °C (77 K) with N2. The SSAs were determined by the BET multipoint method using ten data points at relative pressures of 0.05–0.30. SSA was converted to average particle sizes (APS) using the equation APS = 6/(SSA × ρ). The net density (ρ) of the as-produced NP was approximated by rule of mixtures.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken using FEI NOVA Nanolab SEM and Philips XL-30 SEM. Powder samples were used as is, sintered films were fractured for imaging. All samples were sputter coated with Au/Pd using a SPI sputter coater.
A Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC (TA Instruments, Inc.) was used to observe thermal decomposition of NPs and green films. Samples (15–25 mg) were loaded in alumina pans and ramped to 900 °C at 10 °C min−1 under constant air flow at 60 ml min−1.
Final sintered film densities were determined by Archimedes method using ethanol.
Room temperature AC impedance data were collected with SP-300 (Bio-Logic LLC) in a frequency range of 7 MHz to 1 Hz. Concentric Au/Pd electrodes, 3 mm in diameter, were deposited using a SPI sputter coater on both surfaces of the films using a deposition mask. “EIS spectrum analyser” software was used for extracting total resistance. Equivalent circuit consisting of (RtotalQtotal)(Qelectrode) was used. R and Q denote resistance and constant phase element, respectively. SEM fracture surface images were taken to measure sample thicknesses.
Symmetrical cells were cycled using an SP-300 (Bio-Logic LLC) in a DC steady state approach where constant current was held (28 μA) and the resulting potential was measured over time.
