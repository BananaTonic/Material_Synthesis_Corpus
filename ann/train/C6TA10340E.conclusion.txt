4.Conclusions
The phase behaviour of P1i444FSI OIPC mixed with NaFSI has been explored in detail. Unusual phase behaviour was observed for salt-rich compositions (30 &lt; x &lt; 60 NaFSI), where the crystallisation process was suppressed through the increasing viscosity of the liquid phase at increasing concentration of NaFSI. The partial phase diagram allows a correlation between the thermal and physical properties at different compositions. An extensive DSC study together with conductivity measurements showed metastable behaviour at higher concentrations of NaFSI. Furthermore, the ionic conductivity in these systems is very high at ambient temperatures, even though at high concentrations of NaFSI, the samples are predominantly in the solid state.
Sodium symmetrical cells employing the highly conductive 90 mol% NaFSI electrolyte, were constructed. They demonstrated very reversible and stable Na cycling during 80 cycles, thus confirming the applicability of these materials in Na-based electrochemical devices. Improved cycling performance was observed at higher temperatures, probably related to the higher fraction of liquid phase in the mixture. The results provide strong support for the application of these OIPC mixtures with high concentrations of Na salt as solid electrolytes. Further work is underway to characterise the behaviour in sodium cells incorporating intercalation cathodes as well as to understand the behaviour of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces.
