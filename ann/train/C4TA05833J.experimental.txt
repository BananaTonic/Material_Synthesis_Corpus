Dichloromethane, acetonitrile and diethylether were distilled over P2O5. 2,2′-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, 98%, Acros) was recrystallized from methanol. Carbon black (Ketjen black EC-600JD, Azko Nobel) was dried at 80 °C/1 mm Hg for 12 h prior to use.
Characterization
Molar mass determination of PIL was studied by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in 0.5 M NaNO3 aq. solution. For this purpose, the synthesized PIL was converted into its chloride form: the solution of anhydrous lithium chloride (0.18 g, 4.28 mmol) in 15 mL of anhydrous DMF was added dropwise under inert atmosphere to the solution of PIL (1.00 g, 2.14 mmol) in 20 mL of DMF. The precipitation of the PIL in its chloride form was observed, whereupon it was collected by filtration, washed with DMF and purified by dialysis (Spectra/Por dialysis membrane, molecular weight cut off from 6000 to 8000) firstly in 0.5 M aq. NaCl and then in deionized water. The final polymer solution was freeze-dried and the chloride form of the PIL was studied by GPC: Mw = 4.2 × 105, Mw/Mn = 4.7. GPC experiments were performed at 30 °C on a LC-20AD gel permeation chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) equipped with a Tosoh TSK-GEL G6000 PWXL-CP column and a refractive index detector. 0.5 M NaNO3 aq. solution was used as an eluent with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1. The calibration was made with Pullulan standard set (Shodex P-82).
Intrinsic viscosity [η] of PIL was measured in an Ubbelohde-type capillary viscometer at 25.0 °C using 0.5 M K(FSO2)2N solution in DMF.
NMR spectra were determined in CDCl3 with a Bruker AMX-300 spectrometer at 25 °C. Chemical shifts (δ) downfield from tetramethylsilane were reported in ppm, whereas CHCl2F was used as an internal standard for 19F NMR. A Nicolet Magna-750 Fourier IR-spectrometer was used to record IR spectra at a resolution of 2 cm−1 and with the scan number equal to 128 (KBr pellets).
DSC study of ILM was performed on a Q100 isothermal differential calorimeter (TA Instruments, USA) in the range from −90 to +100 °C at a heating rate of 2.0 °C min−1. Tg of PIL was determined by thermomechanical analysis (TMA) using a Q400 analyzer (TA Instruments, USA) at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and a constant load of 0.08 MPa. Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) measurements were carried out on semi-IPN films (typically length × width × thickness = 15 × 8 × 0.2 (mm)) with a Q800 model (TA Instruments, USA) operating in tension mode (strain between 0.05% and 0.07%, pretension: 10−2 N). Experiments were performed at 1 Hz frequency with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 from −100 to 90 °C. The set up provided the storage and loss modules (E′ and E′′). The damping parameter or loss factor (tan δ) was defined as the ratio tan δ = E′′/E′. Thermal stability of PIL and semi-IPNs was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in air on a Q50 model (TA Instruments, USA) applying a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
Mechanical properties of ionic semi-IPNs: δt – tensile strength (kPa), Et – tensile modulus (kPa) and ε – elongation (%) were estimated at r.t. using a dynamometer “Polyani” (Polyani, Hungary).
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Hitachi H-800 microscope. The samples were previously cut by cryo-ultramicrotomy and then exposed to osmium tetroxide steam for 20 min.
Ionic conductivity and interfacial stability with lithium anode were determined by impedance spectroscopy with a VSP potentiostat (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, France). PIL and semi-IPNs were sandwiched between stainless steel electrodes (conductivity tests) or between lithium electrodes (interfacial stability tests) and sealed under an inert atmosphere (Ar) in a metal CR2016 coin-type cell. For both experiments, the cells were placed in a thermostat (Buchi, Switzerland). The conductivity measurements were performed at 25 °C, while the interfacial stability was studied at 25 and 40 °C. For conductivity vs. temperature dependence, the experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 25 to 130 °C with steps of 8–9 °C. The runs were performed by varying the frequency from 10−2 to 106 Hz with a rate of 6 points per decade and an oscillation potential of 10 mV.
The electrochemical stability window (ECW) of polyelectrolytes was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry under argon atmosphere in a glove box (Jacomex, France) at r.t. using an EG&amp;G 273A (Princeton Applied Research, USA) potentiostat/galvanostat. Two equal films were assembled to make the following layered sequence: Li°/polymer film/Pt or Ni/polymer film/stainless steel grid, which was further placed under the pressure contacts. The ECW tests against Li/Li+ were performed by scanning at 1 mV s−1 from the open circuit potential (OCP) toward positive (using Pt working electrode) or negative (using Ni working electrode) potentials. The contact area of electrodes was 0.2 cm2.
The cycling tests on Li/semi-IPN2c/LiFePO4 polymer batteries were performed at 40 °C using VMP-3 battery tester (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, France). The discharge current rates ranged from C/50 (0.036) to C/3.8 (0.48 mA cm−2) while the charge rate was fixed to C/50. The voltage cut-offs were fixed at 2.0 V (discharge step) and 4.5 V (charge step), respectively.
Ionic liquid monomer (ILM)
N-[2-(2-(2-(Methacryloyloxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)-ethyl]-N-methyl-pyrrolidium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide was prepared in a similar manner to its imidazolium analogues published previously.45,46 The monomer was obtained as slightly brown transparent fluid oil.

Polymeric ionic liquid (PIL)
ILM (2.00 g, 4.3 mmol), DMF (2.00 g) and AIBN (0.02 g, 1.0 wt%) were gently mixed in a flask at ambient temperature. The solution was transferred into a glass ampoule. After triple freeze–thaw–pump cycles, the ampoule was sealed under vacuum and heated to 60 °C for 6 h. The resulting transparent highly viscous polymer solution was slightly diluted with DMF and precipitated into dichloromethane. The polymer was then thoroughly washed with dichloromethane and dried at 70 °C/1 mm Hg for 48 h. Yield: 1.31 g (65%); [η] 0.5 M K(FSO2)2N in DMF = 0.55 dL g−1 (25.0 °C); σDC = 3.4 × 10−6 S cm−1 (25 °C); Tg = −0.3 °C; Td = 255 °C; IR (thin film on KBr): 2956 (m, νC–H), 2917 (m, νC–H), 1724 (s, νCO), 1475 (m), 1463 (m), 1382 (vs, νasSO2), 1360 (vs), 1303 (w), 1270 (m), 1217 (s), 1180 (vs, νsSO2), 1106 (s), 1037 (w), 998 (w), 935 (w), 829 (s), 747 (s), 572 (vs), 483 (w), 454 (w) cm−1.
Typical semi-IPNs synthesis
NBR (0.135 g) was dissolved in 2.0 mL of 1,1,2-trichloroethane with stirring at room temperature for 12 h. To the stirred polymer solution, PEGDM (0.080 g), PEGM (0.040 g), ILM (0.240 g) and DCPD (0.0108 g, 3 wt% of methacrylate monomers) were added under an inert atmosphere. The resulting solution was then loaded into a mould made from two glass plates clamped together and sealed with a U-shaped Teflon® gasket (50.0 mm × 15.0 mm × 0.2 mm). The mold was placed into the thermostat and maintained for 5 h at 50 °C, 1 h at 60 °C and finally 1 h at 70 °C. The resulting film was taken out from the mold and dried for 48 h at 80 °C/1 mm Hg.
For semi-IPN2a–semi-IPN2c preparation, the respective quantities of [N-Me-N-PrPyrr](FSO2)2N and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide were added to the NBR solution at the same time as the methacrylate monomers.
Test cells (full batteries) assembly
Both CR2016 coin-type and coffee-bag-type cells were fabricated. The anode was cut from lithium foil (battery grade, with a thickness of 1 mm) and used as a negative electrode. The cathode was fabricated by film casting from the suspension directly on the aluminum (coffee-bag cells) or steel (coin cells) electrodes. The respective mixtures were obtained by dissolution of PIL (0.100 g, 22 wt%), [N-Me-N-PrPyrr](FSO2)2N (0.100 g, 22 wt%) and Li(CF3SO2)2N (0.028 g, 6 wt%) in 1 mL of DMF overnight. To the obtained clear solution, LiFePO4 (0.205 g, 45 wt%) and carbon black (0.023 g, 5 wt%) were added and the resulting slurry was vigorously mixed at room temperature for an additional 12 h, after which it was poured on the respective electrode surface and the solvent was slowly evaporated at 50–60 °C. Thin (55–60 μm) polymer cathodes together with metal electrodes were dried at 80 °C/1 mm Hg for 24 h and were used without further pressing.
The CR2016 coin-type and coffee-bag-type cells were fabricated by sandwiching a LiFePO4 cathode, a polymer electrolyte membrane (semi-IPN2c) and a lithium metal anode in an argon-filled glove box. The electrochemically active surface areas were between 0.5 and 3.0 cm2, and the loading of active material varied from 4.2 to 10.5 mg cm−2, which corresponds to 0.78–1.82 mA h cm−2.
