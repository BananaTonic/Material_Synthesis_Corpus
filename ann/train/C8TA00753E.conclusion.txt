Conclusions
The effect of ionic concentration in the hydrophilic block of multiblock copolymers on the morphology and properties of anion exchange membranes was systematically investigated in this work. The multiblock copolymer mPEs with 1, 2, 3 and 4 long alkyl chain tethered ionic groups on each repeat unit in the hydrophilic block, resulting in different ion exchange capacities (IECs), were synthesized and compared. Only one head-group tether can be attached on each hydrophilic repeat unit at a time. Thus, the tether amount can be precisely controlled. As the ionic concentration increased, the ionic conductivity and water uptake of the membranes increased. This was due to the increase of the size of ion conducting channels. The 3-Tether membrane showed the highest ionic conductivity/IEC, which means that its ionic groups were most efficient for contributing to the ionic conductivity. In addition, the number of freezable and non-freezable water molecules was investigated. 2,3,4-tether membranes showed similar number of bound water molecules, while the number of freezable water molecules increased with the number of ionic groups. The excess freezable water led to a high water uptake and low ionic conductivity/IEC ratio (i.e. X3Y5-4). Therefore, X3Y5-3 showed the best properties, 130.6 mS cm−1 ionic conductivity at 80 °C and 58.3% water uptake, with an IEC of 1.83 meq g−1. All of the membranes showed the same thermal and alkaline stabilities. As the number of ion groups increased, the mechanical strength of the membranes decreased.
