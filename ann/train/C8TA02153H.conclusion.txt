Conclusions
In summary, the novel TB copolymer (DPM/DMBP-TB) was successfully synthesized. The DPM/DMBP-TB is soluble in NMP and further soluble in DMSO after being slightly grafted with a multi-cation agent. This enabled the preparation of the crosslinked DPM/DMBP-QTB AEMs with high performance. The prepared AEMs have good dimensional stability and low swelling in both aqueous and organic solutions. The long-chain multi-cation crosslinker not only enhances the IEC but also improves the mechanical properties of the AEMs. Typically, AEMs with a crosslinking ratio of 1.5 have a Young's modulus of 977 MPa and good alkaline stability. Meanwhile these membranes have a high hydroxide conductivity (103.9 mS cm−1, 80 °C) and low swelling ratio (20.83%, 60 °C) with an IEC of 1.67 meq g−1. Further single cell performance testing demonstrates that these membranes achieve a maximum power density of 158 mW cm−2 at a current density of 330 mA cm−2. Therefore, Tröger's base-based copolymers have great potential for the preparation of high performance AEMs.
