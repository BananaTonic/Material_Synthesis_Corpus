4.Conclusions
The perovskite layer of planar PSCs is usually deposited by coating an organic solution of perovskite precursors on PEDOT:PSS that is a buffer layer on ITO or FTO. The solution deposition of perovskite materials can significantly enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS from 10−3 to 101 S cm−1. The solvents of perovskite precursor solutions and organic solutions of individual precursor were investigated to understand the main factor for the conductivity enhancement. MAI is identified as the main factor for the conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS. As revealed by UV absorption spectroscopy, XPS spectroscopy and AFM, the conductivity enhancement is attributed to the MAI-induced phase segregation of PSSH chains from PEDOT:PSS and the conformational change of the conductive PEDOT chains. The treatment of the PEDOT:PSS buffer layer also has impact on the photovoltaic performance of planar PSCs. It increases Jsc while lowers FF of PSCs.
