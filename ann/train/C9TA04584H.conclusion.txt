4.Conclusions
BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ shows a predominantly protonic behaviour at a low concentration of oxygen vacancies and humidity at low temperatures, i.e. &lt;400 °C, while still providing very attractive levels of conductivity, e.g. ∼10−3 S cm−1. Note that the scarcity of alternative proton-conducting ceramics, with such competitive protonic conductivity and negligible oxide-ion/electronic influence, has typically prevented the exploitation of electrochemical membrane reactors for chemical reactions in this low temperature range. This peculiar characteristic of BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ with a very high equilibrium constant for hydration that allows competitive levels of proton conductivity to be obtained even in nominally dry gases is currently insufficiently highlighted in the literature, and yet is a highly desirable property for a wide range of chemical de-hydrogenation/hydrogenation reactions. For these reasons, it is expected that BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ, and related doped barium cerates, can play a new role in the electrochemical promotion of chemical reactions in atmospheres of very low humidity, with a significant impact on the future of proton-ceramic conductors.
