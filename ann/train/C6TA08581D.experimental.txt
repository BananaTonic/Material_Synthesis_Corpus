2.Experimental section
2.1Materials and measurements
The ligand was synthesized according to the literature.14 All the other chemical reagents and solvents employed in the experiments were commercially available and used without further purification. TGA was performed using a Perkin-Elmer TGA analyzer from room temperature to 900 °C under a flowing N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were carried out with a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer. IR spectra (4000–400 cm−1) were obtained in KBr discs on a Nicolet Magna 560 IR spectrometer (resolution: 2 cm−1, number of scans: 16 times). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were collected on a Siemens D 5005 diffractometer with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation over the range of 3–50°. The gas adsorption isotherm analysis was performed on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ.
2.2Synthesis
Synthesis of Cu(Hsfpip)(H2O)2·H2O (1)
A mixture of H3sfpip (22.6 mg, 0.0496 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (8.0 mg, 0.0469 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL distilled water with constant stirring for half an hour. Then, the pH was adjusted to 0.55 by dropwise addition of 1 mol L−1 HCl. The mixture was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 170 °C for 4 days. After cooling to room temperature, green crystals were collected (yield: ∼54% based on Cu).

Synthesis of CuH2(Hsfpip)2(H2O) (2)
Compound 2 was synthesised according to the reported steam-assisted conversion method.15 The mixture of H3sfpip (22.6 mg, 0.0496 mmol), H2C2O4·2H2O (17.5 mg, 0.1388 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (4.0 mg, 0.0235 mmol) was placed on a home-made holed-tube inside a Teflon-lined autoclave filled with 1 M HCl (5 mL) and kept at 170 °C for 4 days. Finally, the resulting green crystals were isolated, and dried at room temperature (yield: ∼48% based on Cu).

Synthesis of CuH(Hsfpip)Cl(H2O) (3)
Compound 3 was synthesized by a method similar to that of 2. The mixture of H3sfpip (22.6 mg, 0.0496 mmol) and CuCl2·2H2O (8.0 mg, 0.0469 mmol) was placed on a home-made holed-tube inside a Teflon-lined autoclave filled with 1 M HCl (5 mL) and heated at 170 °C for 4 days. Then it was gradually cooled to room temperature; green crystals were obtained with a yield of ∼56% based on Cu. Elemental analysis calcd for C19H13N4O7CuS2Cl (%): C, 39.86; H, 2.29; N, 9.79; found: C, 39.89; H, 2.42; N, 9.68.

2.3X-ray crystallographic study
The single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements of all crystals were performed on a Bruker Apex II CCD equipped with graphite monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data of crystals were collected at room temperature. Multi-scan absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS program. The structure of crystals was solved by direct methods and refined by F2 full-matrix refinement using the SHELXTL package (SHELXTL-97). Carbon-bonded hydrogen atoms and nitrogen-bonded hydrogen atoms were placed in geometrically calculated positions; hydrogen atoms on water molecules were not assigned or directly included in the molecule formula. Further details of the X-ray structural analysis of compounds are given in Table S1 and bond lengths and angles are presented in Tables S2–S4 in the ESI.
2.4Proton conductivity measurement
The samples were ground into homogeneous powder with a mortar and pestle. The powder of the corresponding compounds was then compressed into pellets at 15 MPa for 1 min. The proton conduction behaviors of materials were measured on an IviumStat electrochemical workstation by alternating-current (AC) impedance measurements over the applied frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz using a quasi-four-probe method with Pt-pressed electrodes under an applied voltage of 50 mV. The temperature and relative humidity are controlled by using a programmable BPHS-060A incubator. ZsimpWin software was used to fit impedance data by means of an equivalent circuit simulation to complete the semicircles of Nyquist plots. The resistance was used to calculate the ion conductivity using the following equation σ = L/(RA) where σ = ion conductivity, L = thickness of the pellet, R = resistance of the pellet, and A = area of the pellet. The activation energy values were obtained from the slope of Arrhenius plots by least-squares fitting.
