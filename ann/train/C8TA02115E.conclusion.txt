Conclusions
A bulky rigid branched structure was introduced into AEM materials for the first time. A series of branched comb-shaped poly(arylene ether sulfone)s with flexible alkyl imidazolium side chains were successfully synthesized. These polymers were soluble and produced transparent, flexible, and tough membranes with promising mechanical properties and thermal stability. The branched polymers increased water uptake and decreased swelling compared with those of the linear polymer while preserving IEC. With increasing branching degree, the ionic conductivity and alkaline stability of the branched polymer membranes improved. The highest ionic conductivity of the branched polymer AEMs reached 126 mS cm−1 at 80 °C, and about 79% of its ionic conductivity was retained after immersion in 1 M KOH at 60 °C for 550 h. A comparison with traditional polymer AEMs demonstrated that the branched polymer membrane with a comb-shaped structure exhibited considerably higher ionic conductivity, which was ascribed to the formation of ion transport channels caused by the increase of free volume and well-developed phase separation following the introduction of a branched structure. In addition, the branched polymer AEMs also showed robust alkaline stability. AEM properties can be improved for use in alkaline fuel cells by introducing a branched structure. The maximum power density of a branched polymer membrane reached 160 mW cm−2 at a current density of 450 mA cm−2. These results suggest that branched comb-shaped polymers are promising for use as membranes in AEMFCs. This work provides an attractive strategy involving introduction of a branched structure into polymers to produce high-performance AEMs.
