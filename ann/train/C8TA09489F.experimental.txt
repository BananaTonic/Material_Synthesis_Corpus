Experimental
Materials
4-(6′-Acryloxy-hexyloxy) benzoic acid (95%, Meryer), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (ionic liquid (IL), 97%, Aladdin), 2-methyl-hydroxy phenol (98%, Aladdin), N,N-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC, 99%, Aladdin), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 99%, Aladdin), hydrochloric acid (HCl, Beijing Chemical Works), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, AR, Macklin), PEGDA (Mn = 1000 g mol−1, Aladdin) and isopropanol (AR, Macklin) were used as received. Dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, AR, Beijing Chemical Works) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, AR, Beijing Chemical Works) were dried with CaH2 and distilled prior to use. Bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI, 99%, Aladdin) was dried at 80 °C under vacuum before use.
Synthesis of LC monomer (C6M)
C6M was synthesized according to previous reports.44,45 Typically, 4-(6′-acryloxy-hexyloxy) benzoic acid (6.44 g, 0.022 mol) and DCC (5.96 g, 0.024 mol) were added to a round-bottom flask containing 60 mL CH2Cl2. Subsequently, the mixture of 2-methyl-hydroxy phenol (1.24 g, 10 mmol) and DMAP (0.28 g, 2 mmol) (dissolved in CH2Cl2) was dropped into the flask and stirred for two days at room temperature. After the reaction, the insoluble salts in the solution were removed by filtering. The obtained solution was further washed by HCl (5 wt% water solution) and NaHCO3 (5 wt% water solution) three times, in sequence. The residue was recrystallized with isopropanol over 5 times. Finally, the product as a white solid (C6M) was obtained. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ, ppm): 8.11 (4H, t), 7.17–7.05 (3H, m), 6.96 (4H, q), 6.42 (1H, d), 6.38 (1H, d), 6.15–6.08 (2H, q), 5.84 (1H,d), 5.81 (1H, d), 4.17 (4H, t), 4.04 (4H, t), 2.23 (3H, s), 1.84 (4H, m), 1.72 (4H, m), 1.66–1.36 (8H, m).
Preparation of composite solid-state polymer electrolyte film using liquid crystal and ionic liquid
The solid-state composite polymer electrolyte was prepared via a facile photopolymerization method. In this study, C6M was used not only as a novel active monomer but also to construct ordered ion channels. In addition, an ionic liquid was used to effectively transport ions. Typically, LC (C6M, 0.5 g) and IL (1 g) were added to a sample bottle containing THF (8 mL), LiTFSI (0.3 g) and 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone (4 wt% of C6M, photoinitiator). After stirring for 10 min, the solution was casted onto a polytetrafluoroethylene mould. The sample was exposed to a 365 nm UV light (GGJ-X1000, Lamp power is 1 KW) for 5 min. Finally, the flexible electrolyte films were dried at 60 °C under vacuum condition for 24 h and named as PLC-IL-1-2. Similarly, PLC-IL-1-1 was obtained. For comparison, a PPEGDA-based electrolyte film was also prepared in the same way.
Characterization
1H NMR spectra were recorded on a JNM-ECZ400S (JEOL, 400 MHz) spectrometer at 25 °C with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard and deuterochloroform (CDCl3) as the solvent. FTIR analyses were conducted on a Thermo Nicolet AVATAR 360 infrared spectrum analyzer from 4000 to 500 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was obtained under N2 atmosphere on a TA600 instrument from 50 to 600 °C (heating rate of 20 °C min−1). DSC measurements were recorded from −90 to 150 °C at a heating/cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 atmosphere using a Q2000 instrument while an empty pan was used as a reference. The samples (4–6 mg) were sealed in aluminium pans during the tests. To determine the microstructure of the electrolyte films (the samples were sputtered with Au for 30 s), SEM (Hitachi SU8010) was employed to characterize the samples. Leica DM2700P polarizing optical microscopy (POM) with a LNP95 heating and cooling stage (the heating or cooling rate was 10 °C min−1) was used to observe the texture structures of the series samples. Specifically, the samples were sandwiched between two circular slides, whose thickness and diameter were 0.14 and 15 mm, respectively. We performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on an Automated Multipurpose X-ray Diffractometer Smartlab 9 kW operating at 45 kV and 200 mA with a copper target (λ = 1.54 Å). Moreover, for the XRD tests, the scanning rate was 3° min−1 from 2° to 15°, and the as-prepared electrolyte film had a thickness of about 80 μm.
Electrochemical measurements
Ionic conductivities of the PLC-IL-1-1 and PLC-IL-1-2 were investigated using alternating-current (AC) impedance analysis on a symmetrical cell of stainless steel (SS)/electrolyte/SS with a frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz (amplitude of 5 mV) using a Zennium Electrochemical workstation (ZahnerEnnium). The testing temperatures were in the range from 30 to 80 °C with a step size of 10 °C min−1. The SS/electrolyte/SS cell was kept at every testing temperature for half-hour before tests. Then, the ionic conductivity was calculated by eqn (1):1where S is the contact area of electrolytes and electrode, L is the thickness of electrolyte films, and R is the bulk resistance of electrolyte films.
The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) analysis was performed on a cell of SS/electrolyte/Li to explore the electrochemical stability of PLC-IL-1-1 and PLC-IL-1-2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 using the Zennium Electrochemical workstation.
AC impedance spectra were recorded on a symmetrical cell of Li/PLC-IL-1-2/Li at 30 °C after different storing times to evaluate the interfacial compatibility of the PLC-IL-1-2 with Li metal. The measurements were implemented in the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz with an oscillation voltage of 5 mV using the Zennium Electrochemical workstation.
The lithium striping/plating experiments for Li/PLC-IL-1-2/Li symmetrical cell was conducted at 30 °C at the current density of 25 μA cm−2 (the charge and discharge times were 6 h, respectively) and 50 μA cm−2 (the charge and discharge times were 2 h, respectively).
In addition, the 2025 coin-type cell was assembled by Li metal anode, LFP-based cathode and the solid electrolyte (PLC-IL-1-2 or PLC-IL-1-1). The process was performed in the Ar-filled glovebox (MB-Labstar 1200/780) with O2 and H2O contents below 0.5 ppm. The cathode was prepared by mixing LFP (70 wt% Pulead Technology Industry Co., Ltd), Super-P (20 wt%) and PVDF (10 wt%). The active substance content of the cathode was about 1.5–2 mg cm−2. The voltage was set in the range of 2.5 to 4.0 V on a LANHE CT2001A battery testing system for the galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements of the coin cells.
In addition, the VTF model has the following equation:2
In the equation, A is a pre-exponential factor that is connected with the number of charge carriers. Ea is the activation energy related to the critical free volume for ion transport, R is the Boltzmann constant, and T0 is a parameter, typically 50 K below the glass transition temperature.
