Safety remains a practical concern in lithium ion batteries (LIBs), which is closely associated with the internal shorting caused by the poor dimensional thermostability at elevated temperature and the flammability of separators. Here, we report a novel strategy to fabricate thermostable and nonflammable silica–polyetherimide–polyurethane (SiO2–PEI–PU) nanofibrous membranes via an electrospinning process. Benefiting from the high porosity, interpenetrating network structure and synergetic effect of silica nanoparticles, PEI and PU, the as-prepared SiO2–PEI–PU membranes exhibit uniform pore size distribution, high ionic conductivity (6.25 mS cm−1) and good electrochemical stability up to 4.86 V. Notably, the hot oven and combustion tests reveal that the SiO2–PEI–PU membranes possess improved thermostability displaying 2% dimensional change after exposure to 170 °C for 0.5 h and flame retardant properties, which could be beneficial for improving the safety of LIBs. Significantly, the SiO2–PEI–PU membrane based Li/LiFePO4 cell exhibits more excellent cyclability delivering a discharge capacity of 158.91 mA h g−1 at the 90th cycle and better rate capability compared with the cell based on the Celgard membrane. Meanwhile, the SiO2–PEI–PU membrane based Li/LiFePO4 cell also shows more excellent cell performance even at an elevated temperature of 60 °C. The results clearly demonstrate that the SiO2–PEI–PU membranes are promising separator candidates, which will also pave the way for further application of nanofibrous membranes in high power LIBs.
