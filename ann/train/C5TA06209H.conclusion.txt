Conclusions
High performance nanofiber composite anion exchange membranes were made where an interconnected fiber network of diamine-crosslinked poly(phenylene oxide)-based polyelectrolyte with either benzyl trimethylammonium or 1,2-dimethylimidazolium fixed charge groups was embedded in an uncharged matrix of reinforcing polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) polymer. Membranes were prepared by: (1) electrospinning brominated poly(phenylene oxide) (BrPPO) and PPSU simultaneously to create a dual fiber mat, (2) soaking the mat in a hexamethylenediamine solution to create inter-chain crosslinks at a limited number of bromomethyl sites in the BrPPO fibers, (3) exposing the mat to chloroform, which caused PPSU to flow and fill void space around the crosslinked BrPPO fibers, and (4) soaking the mat in a solution of either trimethylamine or 1,2-dimethylimidazole solution to convert remaining bromomethyl sites to fixed charge cationic moieties. A series of membranes were fabricated with an effective membrane ion exchange capacity (IEC) of between 1.2 and 2.8 mmol g−1, where IEC was varied due to differences in: (1) the molecular weight of the fixed charge group, (2) the degree of fiber crosslinking, and (3) different amounts of PPSU in the final membrane (either 35 wt% or 50 wt%). For a membrane with 50 wt% PPSU and benzyl trimethylammonium fixed charges with an effective membrane IEC of 2.0 mmol g−1, the hydroxide ion conductivity in liquid water was high at 66 mS cm−1, with reasonable water swelling (97% at room temperature). This membrane was mechanically strong, with a stress-at-break of 15 MPa when equilibrated in water at 23 °C, and exhibited good chemical stability in a hot KOH solution. Preliminary experiments showed that nanofiber composite membranes were amenable to MEA fabrication, and such MEAs performed well in H2/O2 alkaline fuel cell tests, with a peak power of 320 mW cm−2 at 60 °C.
