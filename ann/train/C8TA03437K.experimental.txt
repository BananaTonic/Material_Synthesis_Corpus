2.2Preparation of AEMs
2.2.1Synthesis of partially fluorinated poly(aryl ether) (FPAE)
A typical route for the synthesis of FPAE is shown in Scheme 1. DFP (3.34 g, 10 mmol), BPHF (3.36 g, 10 mmol), toluene (10 mL) and DMAC (30 mL) were charged into a 500 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The reaction was carried out at 80 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was poured into a large amount of methanol to form a precipitate. After being washed repeatedly with methanol, the precipitate was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h to yield FPAE (yield 99%).

2.2.2Synthesis of FPAE bearing multiple active sites (FPAE-3B-X)
The FPAE-3B-X polymers (X = 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0, where X is the molar ratio of BPM to the structural unit of FPAE). Taking FPAE-3B-1.0 as an example, FPAE (1.0 g, 1.56 mmol) was mixed with DMAC (50 mL), BPM (0.63 g, 0.94 mmol) and K2CO3 (0.52 g, 3.8 mmol) in a reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The reaction was performed at 100 °C for 12 h. After cooling down, the mixture was poured into methanol to precipitate a white polymer powder. The powder was washed thoroughly with methanol three times to remove residues, and finally vacuum dried at 80 °C for 24 h (99% yield).
2.2.3Synthesis of FPAE-3B-X-COBr
FPAE-3B-X-COBr was synthesized as follows. FPAE-3B-1.0 (1.0 g, 0.53 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) completely to form a solution; 0.63 g (2.95 mmol) of AlCl3 and 0.72 mL of BHC were then added to the solution for reaction at RT for 5 h. Then the resulting solution was poured into 300 mL of petroleum ether to precipitate the product. After thoroughly washing with methanol three times, the obtained white solid was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h to yield FPAE-3B-X-COBr (yield 85%).
2.2.4Synthesis of FPAE-3B-X-CH2Br
FPAE-3B-X-CH2Br was synthesized by the reduction of the ketone group in the alkyl side chain of FPAE-3B-X-COBr. 2.000 g of FPAE-3B-1.0-COBr was dissolved in 40 mL of CH2Cl2 to form a solution in a flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a condenser. 1.92 mL of TFA and 3.6 mL of TES were added dropwise to the stirred solution. The reaction occurred under reflux at 100 °C for 24 h, followed by precipitating in methanol to yield a raw product. The solid product (FPAE-3B-1.0-CH2Br) was then washed with methanol several times and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h (73% yield).
2.2.5Synthesis of FPAE-3B-X-PD
The synthesis of FPAE-3B-1.0-PD is described as an example. 1.00 g of FPAE-3B-X-CH2Br was dissolved in 30 mL of NMP to form a solution. Then, 5 mL of N-methylpiperidine was added to the solution to perform the reaction at 50 °C for 24 h, followed by coagulation in anhydrous ether and washing several times to obtain functionalized copolymers. Subsequently, the product was dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 24 h to yield FPAE-3B-1.0-PD (91% yield).
2.2.6Fabrication of membranes
A 5% (weight/volume, w/v) FPAE-3B-X-PD copolymer solution in DMF was prepared and filtered through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter to remove impurities. Then the solution was cast onto glass bottom dishes and dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h to obtain a ∼30 μm thick tough transparent film. Then the final membranes were obtained after being immersed in a 1 M aqueous KOH solution for 48 h to exchange ions at RT, followed by washing with degassed deionized (DI) water before measurements.
2.3Characterization and measurements
The chemical structure of the as-synthesized copolymers was confirmed by 1H NMR on a Bruker AV 500 spectrometer (Billerica, MA) using DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 as the solvent. 2D 1H–1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) was used to study the structure of the functionalized polymers in the solution in which the experiment was performed with a standard three-pulse sequence at a mixing time of 800 ms. The molecular weights (Mw and Mn) and polydispersity (η) of the synthesized copolymers were determined via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Waters, USA) using tetrahydrofuran as the eluent with a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 and standard polystyrene samples for calibration. A transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2100 electron microscope) operating at 200 kV was used to observe the morphology of the membranes. Before investigation, each sample was stained with tungstate ions (WO42−) by soaking the membranes in a 1 M aqueous Na2WO4 solution at RT for 48 h. Then, the membrane was rinsed with degassed DI water several times and dried under vacuum at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the membrane samples were embedded into epoxy resin (SPI-Pon™ 812) followed by sectioning to 100 nm thickness and placing on a copper grid for observation. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of the membranes was performed on a SAXSess-MC2 X-ray diffractometer (Anton Paar, Austria) under vacuum. The measurements were performed under vacuum at ambient temperature with dry membrane samples.
2.4Water uptake and swelling ratio
The water uptake (WU) and swelling ratio (SR) of the membrane samples were determined by soaking a dry membrane (1 cm × 2 cm) in degassed DI water at a given temperature for 24 h. Then, the residual water on the membrane surface was removed by dabbing with filter paper before recording the mass (Mwet) and length (Lwet) of the wet membrane. After drying it in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 h, the mass (Mdry) and length (Ldry) of the dry membrane were recorded. The WU and SR were calculated using the following equations:
2.5Ion exchange capacity and hydration number
The IEC of the AEMs was determined by both 1H NMR and the back-titration method. The dry membrane samples (m) were immersed in aqueous HCl solution (20 mL, 0.05 M) for 48 h to ensure that all OH− ions reacted with HCl. The solutions were subsequently titrated with aqueous NaOH (0.05 M) solution to neutral. The calculation of IEC was based on the following equation:where No,HCl and Ne,HCl are the milliequivalents (mmol) of HCl before and after the equilibrium of the AEMs, respectively.
The hydration number (λ), or the number of water molecules close to each ionic group, was calculated as follows:
2.6Hydroxide conductivity
The in-plane hydroxide conductivity of the FPAE-3B-X-PD membranes (1 cm × 4 cm) was measured in a two-probe cell connected to an alternating current impedance analyzer over a frequency range from 0.1 to 1 MHz (10 mV amplitude) on an electrochemical workstation (Princeton, VersaSTAT 4). The resistance (R) of the membrane (OH− type) was recorded in a fully hydrated state and equilibrated at least for 1 h in degassed DI water in the protection of nitrogen to avoid atmospheric CO2 contamination. The conductivity (σ mS cm−1) of the AEMs was calculated as follows:where, L is the distance (cm) between the two reference electrodes, R is the impedance (kΩ) of the membrane, and A is the cross-sectional area (cm2) of the membrane sample.
2.7Thermal stability
Before the thermal stability test, the membrane samples were dried in an oven under vacuum at 100 °C overnight to remove moisture to achieve a constant weight. The test was conducted on a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, SDT-Q600, TA Instruments, USA) in the temperature range from 50 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere.
2.8Mechanical properties
The mechanical tensile strength of the wet AEMs was determined on a universal testing machine (Instron 3343) under ambient conditions. The membrane sample was punched to a dumbbell shape with an effective area of 2 mm × 20 mm before measurements. The stretching rate was set as 2 mm min−1.
2.9Alkaline stability
The alkaline stability of the AEMs was investigated in a 1 M aqueous KOH solution at 80 °C for 600 h. The other parameters such as hydroxide conductivity and IEC were monitored during the stability test.
2.10Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication and single cell performance
The MEA is made up of an AEM and anode/cathode electrodes. The FPAE-3B-3.0-PD membrane in hydroxide form was chosen as the AEM for the construction of the MEA considering its overall properties. The catalyst ink was made up of Pt/C catalyst (0.8 g) (40 wt% Pt, Johnson Matthey), ionomer solution (0.25 g of the FPAE-3B-3.0-PD membrane dissolved in 5 mL of DMF), water (4.3 g) and ethanol (3.3 g). Then, the catalyst ink was sprayed onto both sides of the membrane to prepare the catalyst coated membranes (CCMs). The Pt loading of the catalyst layer was 0.5 mg cm−2 for the anode and cathode. The active area of the MEA was 4 cm2. The resulting CCMs were pressed between two pieces of carbon paper to form the MEA and tested in a fuel cell system. The single H2/O2 cell performance of the MEA was measured at 60 and 80 °C in a TE201 fuel cell system from Kunshan Sunlaite Inc. The flow rate of fully humidified H2 and O2 gases was controlled at 100 mL min−1.
