Conclusions
Through compositional control of flame made nanopowders, we have identified conditions whereby β′′-Al2O3 sintering temperatures can be reduced by nearly 300 °C compared to conventional approaches. Increasing TiO2 dopant levels dramatically enhances sintering but at the cost of excessive grain growth. However, introducing a secondary immiscible phase, ZrO2, provides excellent microstructural control. Sintered films 20–70 μm thick, 96–98% dense with 60–85 wt% of β′′-Al2O3 fractions can be produced using the approach developed here. The combination of high densities and high β′′-Al2O3 fractions results in room temperature ionic conductivities of 3–6 mS cm−1 in these thin films. The formation of t-ZrO2 points to the potential for robust mechanical properties.
Finally, we demonstrate a symmetrical Na/β′′-Al2O3/Na cell that can be cycled at ambient showing its potential utility in Na batteries using β′′-Al2O3 solid electrolytes.
The processes used are easily translatable to mass production, and with the availability of β′′-Al2O3 thin films, novel battery designs in flat geometries can be realized perhaps providing an obvious pathway to Na solid state batteries that operate at ambient temperatures.
The main focus of the work has been on optimizing compositions and sintering conditions of NAMO. Future work will address mechanical properties, critical current densities, conductivity measurements at varying temperatures, and construction of Na batteries using the NAMO films.
