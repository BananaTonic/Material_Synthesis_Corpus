Conclusions
In conclusion, we fabricated a flexible PM composite thin film with liquid-phase exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets and PEDOT:PSS solutions via a facile direct vacuum filtration. On the one hand, the common organic solvents (DMF and NMP) for dispersing MoS2 nanosheets effectively removed some of the non-conductive PSS chains during the filtration, resulting in a significantly enhanced electrical conductivity compared to the pristine PEDOT:PSS thin film. The MoS2 nanosheets had a negative effect on the electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS thin film diluted with organic solvent. However, the PM thin films with a low content of MoS2 nanosheets (3–5 wt%) still achieved a high electrical conductivity, especially for the PM4-D (1250 S cm−1). On the other hand, the introduction of exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets led to an improved Seebeck coefficient of the PM thin film (19.5 μV K−1) due to the relatively high carrier mobility compared with that of pristine PEDOT:PSS. An optimized TE power factor and ZT value of 45.6 μW m−1 K−2 and 0.04, respectively, for the PM4-D thin film at room temperature was ultimately achieved. These results demonstrate that the TE performance of pristine PEDOT:PSS can be optimized by combining it with organic solvent-assisted exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets.
