Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared high-performance, highly electrically conducting, large-scale, and free-standing PEDOT electrodes with excellent flexibility by a modified self-assembled micellar soft-template method followed by vacuum-assisted filtration. The 140-PEDOT electrode shows the best electrochemical performance in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte (470.6 and 389.3 mF cm−2 at 1 and 20 mA cm−2) and enhanced electrochemical performance (667.5 and 500.1 mF cm−2 at 1 and 20 mA cm−2) in a polydopamine redox-mediated electrolyte, PD0.08, with about 42% increase in specific capacitance. The PEDOT NW film exhibits stable electrochemical performance after reciprocating bending for 5000 times from 0 to 180°, indicating excellent flexibility. In addition, a high-performance flexible solid-state SC based on the 140-PEDOT electrode with a PVA–H2SO4–polydopamine robust gel film electrolyte is fabricated. The device shows excellent rate performance with a high specific area capacitance of 413.5 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and 306.0 mF cm−2 at 50 mA cm−2, an outstanding energy density of 48.3 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 0.22 mW cm−2 and a superior power density of 16.77 mW cm−2 at an energy density of 19.1 μWh cm−2. Therefore, this work offers a facile and scalable method to fabricate safe, flexible and high performance SCs.
