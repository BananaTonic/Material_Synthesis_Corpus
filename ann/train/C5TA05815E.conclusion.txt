4.Conclusions
A novel Co-free cathode, La0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3−δ (LSFCr-3), exhibiting the desired combination of high electrical conductivity, physical and chemical stability, and electrocatalytic activity, was systematically investigated for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications. The LSFCr-3 perovskite is shown to have a hexagonal crystal structure (R3̄c), which is thermodynamically stable upon heating to 900 °C in air. The exact composition of the bulk of the LSFCr-3 material is suggested to be either La0.34Sr0.67(Fe3+0.346Fe4+0.354Cr3+0.174Cr4+0.116)O2.9 or La0.34Sr0.67(Fe3+0.346Fe4+0.354Cr3+0.257Cr6+0.033)O2.9 at room temperature.
Under typical SOFC cathode conditions, both the rapid oxygen bulk diffusion (10−2 S cm−1) and high surface exchange rate (10−5 cm s−1) of the LSFCr-3 material are assumed to be related primarily to the presence of the Cr cations. Cr has a strong preference to maintain a 6-fold coordination with oxygen anions, which, in turn, causes disorder in the oxygen vacancy sub-lattice, resulting in very good oxygen ionic conductivity (bulk diffusion) within the LSFCr-3 material. The segregated oxygen vacancies, arising from the Cr6+ oxidation state at the surface, are suggested to be responsible for the very high k values obtained for the LSFCr-3 perovskite. This is therefore the first time that a beneficial effect of Cr on the electrical characteristics of a perovskite-based mixed conductor (LSFCr-3) is being reported.
In a symmetrical half-cell configuration based on the LSFCr-3 electrode material, a promising open circuit polarization resistance of only 0.25 Ω cm2 was achieved at 750 °C in air. The rate determining step of the oxygen redox reaction at LSFCr-3 at under these conditions is likely the electron charge transfer process. When LSFCr-3 was used as the cathode in a Ni–SDC anode-supported fuel cell, a maximum power density of 0.81 W cm2 was obtained, which is higher than what has been reported when the widely used LSCF cathode was used in a similar anode-supported configuration. The LSFCr-3 material is clearly a very promising and robust new cathode material for use in SOFCs.
