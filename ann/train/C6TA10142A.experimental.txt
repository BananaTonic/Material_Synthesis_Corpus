Materials synthesis
Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01 solid electrolyte was prepared by a high-energy ball milling technique and subsequent heat treatment. Li2S (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), P2S5 (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and MoS2 (99%, Alfa Aesar) crystalline powders were used as the starting materials, which were mixed in the stoichiometric proportion of Li2S : P2S5 : MoS2 = 7 : 2.9 : 0.1 in an argon-filled glovebox. The powders were placed into an argon-gas-filled zirconia pot (45 mL in volume) with ten zirconia balls (10 mm in diameter) and then milled using a high-energy planetary ball mill apparatus at 510 rpm for 60 h at room temperature. In order to maintain uniformity, the process was conducted by repeatedly milling clockwise for 40 min and anticlockwise for 40 min. The Li7P3S11 glass-ceramic solid electrolyte (Li2S : P2S5 = 7 : 3) was also prepared by mechanical milling under the same conditions mentioned above. Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01 and Li7P3S11 glass-ceramics were finally obtained by heat treatment of the ball-milled powders at 240–260 °C in an argon atmosphere for 2 h. All the preparation processes were performed in a dry glovebox (O2 &lt; 0.1 ppm, H2O &lt; 0.1 ppm).
To obtain the S–Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01–C composite electrode, sulfur (99%, Alfa Aesar), acetylene carbon black (AB) and Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01 glass-ceramic with a weight ratio of 30 : 10 : 60 were prepared. First, the sulfur (75 wt%) and AB (25 wt%) were mixed into a zirconia pot with ten zirconia balls (10 mm in diameter) and milled at 370 rpm for 8 h at room temperature. The obtained powders were S/AB composites, which were used for subsequent experiments. Then, the mixture of S/AB (40 wt%) and Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01 glass-ceramic (60 wt%) was mechanically milled at 370 rpm for 8 h at room temperature using a high-energy planetary ball mill apparatus, after which the S–Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01–C composite was obtained. The S–Li7P3S11–C composite was also prepared through the same procedure by substitution of the solid electrolyte.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out using an X'Pert PRO instrument with copper Kα radiation from 10° to 60°. Raman spectra were obtained using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope at an excitation of 532 nm and all samples were sealed in a chamber with a glass window in the glovebox. The morphologies of the samples were examined using a Hitachi S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrochemical properties were measured on a PARSTAT MC multi-channel electrochemical workstation.
Electrochemical evaluation
The ionic conductivities of the solid electrolytes were measured through samples cold-pressed at 380 MPa, with a diameter of 10 mm. Indium foils were used as the current collectors and blocking electrodes on both sides of the pellets. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at frequencies from 1 MHz to 10 Hz was performed on the blocking cells to determine the temperature dependence of the solid electrolytes at temperatures from 298 K to 388 K. Lithium symmetric non-blocking cells were fabricated for a chronoamperometry test. The electrochemical stability of the asymmetric lithium metal/solid electrolyte/stainless steel cell was conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at voltages ranging from −0.5 V to 5 V at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 at room temperature.
The all-solid-state Li-S batteries were assembled in a dry argon-filled glovebox using composite positive electrodes, lithium metal as negative electrodes, and solid electrolytes. The obtained S–Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01–C and S–Li7P3S11–C composites were used as the active materials for the positive electrodes. For the assembly of the all-solid-state batteries, the composite cathode and solid electrolytes powders were placed sequentially in a 10 mm die and then cold-pressed at a pressure of 380 MPa for 3 min. After that, the lithium foils were placed on the surface of the solid electrolyte and the obtained three-layer pellet was sandwiched between two stainless steel disks. The formed pellet was then pressed under 120 MPa for 3 min at room temperature to obtain the solid-state cells. The galvanostatic charge–discharge performance was determined on a LAND battery test system at the rate of 0.05C between cut-off potentials from 1.0 V to 3 V at room temperature. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the all-solid-state cells was tested on a PARSTAT MC multi-channel electrochemical workstation. The calculation of the charge–discharge capacities was based on the mass of sulfur.
