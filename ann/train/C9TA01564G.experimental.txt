General synthetic procedure for PEO/poly(β-oxo-carbonate)
In a typical experiment for PC-1, 200 mg of bis-αCC (0.787 mmol, 1 eq.) and 1181 mg (0.787 mmol, 1 eq.) of poly(ethylene glycol) (Mn = 1500 g mol−1) were added in a reaction tube with 1.3 mL of dry DMSO. 0.2 mL (0.04 mmol, 0.05 eq.) of DBU solution (C = 0.2 M in DMSO) was added and the reaction medium was stirred at 25 °C. After 24 h, the obtained polymer was purified by double precipitation in diethyl ether. The purified polymer was dried under vacuum at 60 °C (1284 mg, 93% yield).
PC-2 and PC-3 were synthesized with the same procedure. 1H and 13C-NMR spectra are reported in the ESI.

After 24 h, the obtained polymer was purified by double precipitation in diethyl ether. The purified polymer was dried under vacuum at room temperature (1602 mg, 89% yield).
Preparation of polymer electrolytes
Solid poly(oxo-carbonate) electrolyte
70 mg of aliphatic poly(β-oxo-carbonate) and 30 mg of LiTFSI were dissolved in 1 mL of acetone. After 1 h of mixing, the solvent was evaporated at room temperature followed by a thermal treatment for 24 h at 60 °C.
All solid cross-linked SPE
60 mg of PC-3, 20 mg of cross-linkable polycarbonate (PC-4), 20 mg of diethylene glycol diacrylate, 42.85 mg of LiTFSI and 3 mg of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (photoinitiator) were dissolved in 1 mL of acetone. After 1 h, the solution was cast onto a silicon mold. The solvent was removed under ambient conditions followed by a high vacuum treatment. Finally, the films were passed 3 times under a xenon arc lamp (Helios Italquartz, 45 mW cm−2). Before performing electrochemical characterization, the SPEs were dried under vacuum at rt for 24 h, followed by increasing the temperature up to 60 °C for 2 h.
2.2Characterization methods
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
1H and 13C NMR analyses were performed on Bruker Avance 250 or 400 MHz spectrometers in CDCl3, DMSO or DMF at 25 °C in the Fourier transform mode. 16 or 64 scans for 1H spectra and 512 or 2048 scans for 13C spectra were recorded.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and molar-mass dispersity (Đ) of the different polymers were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in THF at 45 °C at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 with a Viscotek 305 TDA liquid chromatograph equipped with two PSS SDV linear M columns calibrated with poly(methyl methacrylate) standards and a refractive index detector.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a DSC Q2000 differential calorimeter (TA Instruments). All the experiments were performed under ultrapure nitrogen flow. Samples of 5–8 mg were used. Measurements were performed by placing the samples in sealed aluminium pans. The samples were first heated at a rate of 20 K min−1, from 30 °C to 100 °C and they were left for 3 min at 100 °C to eliminate the thermal history. Subsequently, the samples were cooled down to −70 °C at a rate of 10 K min−1 and subsequently heated to 100 °C at 10 K min−1 after waiting at −70 °C for 3 min. Once again, the samples were cooled at a rate of 50 K min−1 until −70 °C, and later they were heated up at 20 K min−1 up to 100 °C, in order to determine the glass transition temperature.
Rheological measurements were performed using an ARES-G2 rheometer from TA Instruments equipped with an ARES-G2 curing accessory, made of a light guide, a quartz plate and a reflecting mirror assembly allowing the transfer of UV radiation from the UV-light source to the sample. UV curing at 365 nm was performed with an OmniCure Series 2000 (200 W, 365 nm). Typically, 60 mg of aliphatic polycarbonate, 20 mg of cross-linkable polycarbonate, 20 mg of diethylene glycol diacrylate, 42.85 mg of LiTFSI and 3 mg of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (ultraviolet initiator) were dissolved in 1 mL acetone. After stirring for 1 h, the solutions were casted onto the rheometer plate (disc of 2 cm in diameter). The acetone was evaporated under ambient atmosphere for 30 min, and then under vacuum for 10 min. The time evolutions of the elastic and viscous moduli were recorded at a frequency of 1 Hz and a strain of 1% without and under UV irradiation at 365 nm. Stress–strain experiments were performed with an Instron 5566 at r.t. The membrane was positioned in between the two clamps of the machine and a deformation rate of 2 mm min−1 was applied until the sample broke.
X-ray diffraction (XRD)
The prepared SPE membranes (SIN-PC-3 and SIN-PC-3/TEG) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation) in the range of 10–90°.
The ionic conductivity was studied by electrochemical AC impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with an Autolab 302N potentiostat galvanostat with temperature controlled by a Microcell HC station. The membranes were placed between two stainless steel electrodes and sealed in a Microcell under an inert atmosphere in a glove box (M-Braun) to avoid the contact of the sample with moisture. The frequency range was set from 0.1 MHz to 0.1 Hz and the amplitude was 10 mV. In all the cases the average surface area of the electrode was 0.5026 cm2. The lithium transference number and electrochemical stability of the SPE were characterized in coin cells CR2032, and the values were measured using Autolab 302N potentiostat galvanostat. For the lithium transference number the SPE was sandwiched between two lithium disks, whereas for electrochemical stability it was sandwiched between a lithium disk and a stainless steel (SS) electrode. Before the analysis, the coin cells were left to stabilize at 70 °C for 24 h. The lithium transference number was calculated based on the Bruce and Vincent method at 70 °C. The electrochemical stability window was determined from the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the polymer electrolyte at 70 °C. The anodic limit was evaluated between the open circuit potential (OCV) and 5.5 V vs. Li+/Li at a constant rate of 0.5 mV s−1.
The battery performances of the electrolyte membranes were analyzed in two-electrode coin cells, using C-coated LiFePO4 (LFP) provided by Prayon-beLife company (Pholicat FE-100) as the working electrode, Li metal (Aldrich), and solid cross-linked or plasticized SPE (SIN-PC-3 and SIN-PC-3/TEG) as the solid electrolyte. The positive electrode was prepared by dispersing 60 wt% LiFePO4, 20 wt% conductive carbon (Super P), and 20 wt% poly(β-oxo-carbonate) PC-3 as the binder in acetone under stirring for 2 h. The resulting slurry was coated on aluminum foil using the doctor-blade method with a thickness of 120 μm and then dried at 50 °C in a vacuum for 8 h. Discs of 1.2 cm diameter, containing 1–2 mg cm−2 of LiFePO4 were cut. For the preparation of all-solid cross-linked SPEs (SIN-PC-3), 600 mg of PC-3, 200 mg of cross-linkable polycarbonate PC-4, 200 mg of diethylene glycol diacrylate, 420 mg of LiTFSI and 30 mg of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (photoinitiator) were dissolved in 2 mL of acetone. After 1 h, the solution was cast onto a Teflon mold. The acetone was removed under ambient conditions followed by a high vacuum treatment. Finally, the films were passed 3 times under a xenon arc lamp (Helios Italquartz, 45 mW cm−2). Before battery assembly, the SPEs were dried under vacuum at rt for 24 h. Discs of 1.4 cm diameter (∼100 μm thickness) were cut. Cross-linked SPEs, SIN-PC-3, with TEG were prepared according to the same procedure and by adding 120 mg of tetraglyme to a mixture of 600 mg of PC-3, 200 mg of cross-linkable polycarbonate PC-4, 200 mg of diethylene glycol diacrylate, 420 mg of LiTFSI and 30 mg of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone. The SIN-PC-3 based electrolyte was sandwiched between metallic lithium and the working electrode. CR2032 coin cells were assembled under argon in a glove box. The galvanostatic charge/discharge curves were recorded using a multichannel Biologic potentiostat (VMP3) between 2.5 and 4.2 V vs. Li+/Li0 at different cycling rates C/n (1 Li per f.u. in n hours). Cycling galvanostatic measurements were conducted under thermostatic conditions at 25 ± 0.5 and at 60 ± 1 °C. For the rate capability, the cells were cycled at charge/discharge rates from 0.1 to 1C. After the rate capability study, the cells were cycled back at a lower rate (0.5C) for 4 cycles to test if the reduction of capacity at the highest rates is reversible, which gives an indication of the stability of the electrolyte polymer at high current densities. All over the manuscript, the capacity is referenced to the mass of LiFePO4 in the composite cathode.
