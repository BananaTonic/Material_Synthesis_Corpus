Conclusions
In summary, a flexible lab-on-paper device for self-charging/recharging, self-powered electropolymerization and sensing is presented based on an output controllable power paper with the paper microfluidic technique. Carefully operating a double bottom-up growth strategy to fabricate highly conductive and bendable gold networks attached on intertwined micro-sized cellulose fibers not only enlarged the effective surface area of the active electrode, but also realized vertical conductivity between two opposite sides of the paper which will be important for accelerating the construction of complex 3D paper circuits. Experimental results also demonstrated a low-cost pencil-drawing approach based on the porosity of the paper for overcoming the key technical challenge of bidirectional control of current. Furthermore, the power paper consisting of a magnesium anode and a Prussian blue cathode with a self-charging/recharging property was able to drive electropolymerization, and the ECL system. The present strategy being of low-cost, space-saving, environmentally benign, and easy-to-manipulate, is anticipated to offer a solution to the emerging power supply problem of the forthcoming Internet of Things, and green electronics.
