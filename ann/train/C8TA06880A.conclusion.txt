Conclusions
Motivated by studies on analogous Ln2NiO4+δ (Ln = La, Pr, or Nd) oxide systems, Ln2LiHO3 oxyhydrides with different Ln (Ln = La, Pr, Nd or Sm) were examined. K2NiF4-type hydride ion-conducting oxyhydrides were produced via high-pressure synthesis (2 GPa, 30 min, 650 °C). Phase identification revealed that Ln = La, Pr or Nd systems possessed isostructural phases. They had a t factor (&gt;0.828) that was relatively smaller than that of analogous oxides (&gt;0.857), indicating high hydride ion compressibility. The anion distribution in the perovskite units depended on the Ln element, where (i) La: no anion mixing, (ii) Pr: O mixing at H (2b) sites and H mixing at O (2d) sites and (iii) Nd: H mixing at 2d sites. The low O content enhanced hydride ion conductivity, and Nd2LiHO3 produced the highest conductivity and the lowest Ea value (2.20 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 280 °C and 62.3 kJ mol−1, respectively). The computational results suggested a minimum activation barrier for anion diffusion of ∼1 eV in all Ln, which is 0.1 eV higher than that in the experimental results. The promotion of the O2− vacancies (instead of the H− vacancies or interstitials) is essential in avoiding an intermediate step containing Li with three axial O atoms and one axial H atom. Diffusion is made possible by a sequence of axial H or O migration to an adjacent vacant axial site. Although the choice of Ln in the Ln2LiHO3 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd) system modifies the lattice volume because of the differences in the ionic radius, Ln-dependent anion arrangements at the axial sites control the electrochemical properties of the material. This novel knowledge provides important information for further development of K2NiF4-related oxyhydrides with higher ionic conductivities.
