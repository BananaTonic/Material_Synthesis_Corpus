Conclusions
We have prepared dense LZP phases by quenching sol–gel processed solid precursors from 1100 °C for the first time. Due to reduction of grain boundary resistances, the as-prepared phases (LZP-1100) possess higher total conductivity than previously reported LZP phases and conductivity values close to spark plasma sintered phases. We demonstrate that the use of thin layers of Au buffer improves the contact between LZP and Li metal and effectively reduces the interfacial resistance. Upon Li+ cycling, a surface layer of Li3P/Li8ZrO6 is formed on LZP. The interface is Li+ conductive and has a stable resistance upon Li+ cycling at relatively low current densities. It is proposed that the surface microstructure plays a critical role in determining the interfacial resistance and the stability of the interface upon cycling. Homogeneous, highly dense surfaces are required to achieve less resistive and more stable interphases upon Li+ cycling. This highlights the importance of engineering of the surface microstructure to obtain stable SEI with Li in case of robust ceramic solid-electrolytes. LTP shows excellent chemical and electrochemical compatibility with LZP and is suggested as a potential electrode material in proposed LZP-based all-solid-state batteries.
