3.Results and discussion
The overall conducting behaviour of BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ in nominally dry atmospheres was analysed by impedance spectroscopy between 100 and 500 °C in H2, 10% H2–N2 and N2. It can be noted that the total conductivity follows the sequence σ(H2) &gt; σ(10% H2–N2) &gt; σ(N2) (Fig. 2a), albeit without considerable differences in each case. The current results of total conductivity measured in nominally dry H2 are observed to be comparable to those of literature data for this material measured in humidified H2 (Table 1). This similarity suggests elevated levels of hydration in all cases, as will be clarified in the later text.

The results show a very low conductivity dependence on the hydrogen partial pressure, suggesting the contribution from electronic species to be minor.
To further elucidate the potential role of electronic contribution in BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ, coulometric titration measurements were performed at elevated temperatures. Fig. 2c depicts the effect of temperature and oxygen partial pressure on the oxygen non-stoichiometry change (Δδ). A possible change in the oxygen non-stoichiometry in BCY10 at high temperatures could be related to the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ under reducing conditions according to:4with an equilibrium constant for the reduction reaction described by:5
The subsequent existence of mixed valence ascribed to cerium reduction would be expected to introduce small-polaron electronic conduction (i.e. a localized, mobile electron, ), in addition to the oxide-ion and protonic conduction. In this respect, the results of coulometric titration show considerable variations of oxygen non-stoichiometry with oxygen partial pressure at higher temperature, while the importance of this feature rapidly diminishes as the temperature decreases (Fig. 2c). This behaviour corresponds to the lower reducibility of cerium cations in the perovskite BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ with decreasing temperature, as also reported for other doped-barium cerates, where very extreme reducing conditions and very high temperatures are required to produce appreciable alteration of the oxygen-vacancy and electronic concentrations.24,25 Note that these results contrast with those of fluorite-ceria-based materials that, conversely, show much higher reducibility under reducing conditions.21,22
From the results of oxygen-nonstoichiometry change, the corresponding equilibrium constant, KR (ESI Fig. S1), was extracted for the high temperature range (800–975 °C), where significant reduction occurs, following a methodology developed earlier.21,22 A unique equation was then obtained for the temperature dependence of KR:6KR(T) = 2.54 × 1021 exp(−9.68 × 104/T)(atm1/2)yielding a reduction enthalpy, ΔHR = 804.99 kJ mol−1. This value is significantly higher than those previously obtained for ceria-based materials21,22,26–28 and is the factor responsible for the low reducibility of BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ under such conditions of intermediate to low temperatures.
The effects of the partial components of conductivity on the total electrical behaviour were also analysed under different conditions of hydrogen partial pressure and temperature by means of the expected concentrations of the various defects according to defect chemistry, provided by eqn (1)–(5), and the corresponding electroneutrality conditions according to:7
Assuming that  and  are not considerably affected by pO2 and pH2O at lower temperatures, eqn (3) and (5) can be rearranged to express the concentration of the protonic and electronic defects as a function of oxygen vacancy concentration, according to:89
Recombining eqn (7)–(9) we obtain the following polynomial equation10where . The oxygen vacancy concentration can be determined from the numerical solution of eqn (10) for given pairs of pO2 and pH2O, which allows the determination of electronic- and protonic-defect concentrations by means of eqn (8) and (9). For this purpose, we used the equilibrium constant for hydration reactions at different temperatures determined by means of the standard reaction entropy (ΔS = −167.9 J (mol K)−1) and enthalpy (ΔH = −163.3 kJ mol−1) reported by Kreuer for BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ (ref. 2) and the values of the reduction-reaction constant obtained from the experimental results of coulometric titration (eqn (6)).
The defect-concentration profiles, represented in Fig. 3a, show a significant dominance of the ionic charge carriers over the electronic charge carriers in the studied temperature range. This is in good agreement with the low equilibrium constant for reduction (eqn (5) and (6)), leading to a very low electronic concentration under the studied conditions. Moreover, it is observed that the low temperature range, 350–400 °C, is dominated by protons, while the higher temperature range, 550–600 °C, is dominated by oxygen vacancies. The dominance of protonic defects at low temperatures is related to the very high equilibrium constant for water incorporation in BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ (eqn (3)), which permits significant hydration even for pH2O values as low as ∼10−5 atm.29 In contrast, the dominance of oxygen vacancies in the higher temperature region (550–600 °C) is related to the dehydration of the sample. Convergence of the concentration of both protons and oxygen vacancies occurs at intermediate temperature, i.e. ∼525 °C. Interestingly, the concentration of protonic charge carriers is always dominant at low temperatures, even under less reducing conditions (ESI Fig. S2).
Temperature dependence of: (a) defect concentration profiles; (b) concentration protonic defects obtained from TG and from the simulation; (c) mobility and activation energy associated with different charge carriers employed for fitting total conductivity results; (d) total (experimental and calculated) and partial conductivities. Data obtained in the temperature range of 350–600 °C, under nominally dry conditions (pH2 ≈ 1 atm for (a, c and d) and pH2 ≈ 0.1 atm for (b)).
ESI Fig. S2 shows that the concentration of protonic defects effectively reaches the saturation limit at lower temperature for higher values of pH2. This is followed by a practically imperceptible decrease as pH2 decreases, which is electrically balanced by the decrease of electronic concentration and the improvement of oxygen vacancy concentration. This behaviour is consistent with the experimental results of higher values of pH2O as pH2 rises, as shown in Fig. 2d, which also confirms the relevance of protonic species for pH2O values as low as 10−5 to 10−4 atm. Furthermore, it explains why the total conductivity of BCY in the current work remains comparable to that of previous literature studies, Table 1, despite analysis at much lower humidity. Fig. 3b compares the experimental hydration profile obtained by thermogravimetry under nominally dry conditions and that calculated by using defect chemistry at pH2O ≈ 6.64 × 10−5 atm. using the values of ΔH and ΔS mentioned above and reported earlier.2 The experimental profiles match those obtained by simulation, showing that hydration starts to increase on cooling below ∼600 °C, where a higher value of hydration, in the studied temperature range, was found at ∼350 °C.
The contribution of each species to the overall electrical conduction process is determined by the combination of the defect concentration and the defect mobility, according to the following expression:11σi = qiμiCiwhere qi, Ci and μi represent the charge, the concentration and the mobility of the species i.
The results of total conductivity were fitted by the sum of contributions ascribed to different species by means of the defect profiles and using typical values of mobility and activation energy for the corresponding carriers, as shown in Fig. 3c, and are in close agreement with the available literature on barium-cerate materials30 (Table 2). In the simulation procedure adopted in this work, the values of mobility were adjusted to fit the simulated total conductivity to the experimental values, following a procedure developed earlier.31 As observed in Table 2, our mobility values for proton and oxide-ion diffusion agree well with those obtained by Kreuer et al.30 for BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ. Note that the mobility values presented in Fig. 3c are the parameters that produce the fitting of the experimental results shown in ESI Fig. S3, and, although being susceptible to a considerable uncertainty, they lie in the expected range of values for each species according to the literature.

According to the expected conductivity profiles by means of the equilibrium constants and mobilities, the protonic conductivity is several orders of magnitude higher than the oxide ionic and electronic conductivities between 350 and 400 °C. Interestingly, protonic conductivity is maintained at the same order of magnitude in the whole hydrogen partial pressure range for each temperature (ESI Fig. S3), even under less reducing conditions where the concentration of H2 in the feed stream is lower, and the consequent pH2O in the experimental setup is ∼5 × 10−5 atm. Nonetheless, as temperature rises, proton conductivity denotes a change in the slope for T ≥ 450–500 °C (Fig. 3d), where dehydration of the sample becomes significant and mixed conduction of both protons and oxygen ions is then relevant. This is related to the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies (Fig. 3a), which is in agreement with previous studies from Kreuer9,29 and Coors7 for measurements under wet conditions.
On the other hand, under the strongly reducing conditions of the current work (pO2 ∼ 10−44 to ∼10−27 atm, in the range T = 350–600 °C), protonic charge carriers could also be formed by oxidative hydrogen uptake, according to:12
Nonetheless, this mechanism of proton uptake will probably have negligible influence on increasing protonic conductivity as the low values of KR (ESI Fig. S1) at low temperature indicate a very low concentration of , negating the possibility of significant proton uptake by cerium reduction. Moreover, according to eqn (12), the creation of a protonic species would be accompanied by the creation of an electronic carrier. Here, due to the expected higher mobility of electronic species (Table 2), this would be reflected in a predominance of electronic conductivity (rather than the predominance of protonic conductivity). The low values of electronic conductivity found in this work, thus, suggest that this mechanism is not influencing the transport properties.
Consequently, oxide-ion and protonic conductivities have the same order of magnitude, at T ≈ 550 °C (∼10−3 S cm−1). A characteristic activation energy for protonic conductivity Ea,H+ ∼ 0.41 eV (ref. 7) was calculated in the temperature range of 350–450 °C, where proton transport dominates with a linear behaviour in the Arrhenius representation and before any discernible inflection associated with a mixed conducting regime. Conversely, the very high activation energy for oxide-ionic conductivity Ea,O2− ∼ 1.61 eV in the lower temperature range is a consequence of the activation energy for the oxide-ion mobility (Fig. 3c) and also of the increased oxygen vacancy concentration with temperature (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, as expected from the very low equilibrium constant for cerium reduction in BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ between 300 and 500 °C, the electronic conductivity is several orders of magnitude lower than the ionic contribution (H+, O2−). Instead, as a consequence of the very high reduction enthalpy, a very high activation energy for electronic conductivity Ea,e− ∼ 2.59 eV was obtained in the whole temperature range, which is in good agreement with previous reports on doped-barium cerates.24
