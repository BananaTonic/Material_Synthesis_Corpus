Conclusions
In summary, an efficient multi-doping strategy enhanced the Li-ion conductivity of the garnet-type solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12. We synthesized undoped LLZO, mono-doped LLZTO, dual-doped LLBZTO, and ternary-doped LGLBZTO using the solid-state method. The synthesized garnet electrolytes were characterized via XRD, NPD, SEM, EDS mapping, and solid-state NMR techniques. The ceramic density of the synthesized garnets was near the theoretical density of LLZO. NPD Rietveld analysis revealed an increased Li+ occupancy at the tetrahedral-24dLi1 site with increased multi-ion doping in LLZO, whereas Li+ occupancy at the octahedral-96hLi2 site remained constant. The increased Li-ion conductivity with multi-ion doping can be ascribed to the dense microstructure, decreased 96hLi2/24dLi1 Li+ occupancy ratio, and reduced oxygen defects. The prepared ternary-doped LGLBZTO was tested for all solid-state Li+ cells with the Li|LGLBZTO|LFP configuration and the results showed a reasonable cyclability of over 6 cycles.
