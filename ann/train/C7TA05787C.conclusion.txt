Conclusions
In summary, a new class of single-ion polymer conductors that possess an alternating structure is presented in this work. These polymers were synthesized by the simple radical copolymerization of SSPSILi and MA monomers. The structure of the prepared single-ion conductor was determined by spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR). The alternating arrangement of MA with a high dielectric constant and SSPSILi results in the high rate and very uniform dissociation of the lithium ions, leading to a significant improvement of σLi+ and tLi+. The corresponding composite SPE membrane displays both high ionic conductivity (σ = 2.57 mS cm−1) and high transference number of the lithium ions (approaching 1) at room temperature. The SPE membrane also shows other suitable features for use in LIBs, such as good mechanical strength, sufficient thermal stability, and a wide electrochemical stability window. The battery using the prepared SPE membrane exhibited outstanding cycling stability without any distinct capacity decay, even at high C rates. All these results suggest great possibilities for this composite SPE membrane, which is based on a new single-ion conductor with an alternating structure, for application in next-generation lithium-ion batteries.
