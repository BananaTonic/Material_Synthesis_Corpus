Conclusions
The aim of this study was to develop a strategy to design a solid electrolyte with a simultaneous low swelling ratio and high water uptake for alkaline fuel cells without compromising on the conductivity. CNC-based composite films were prepared with the PVAâ€“silica gel hybrid as the binder. The hydrophobicity of the binder and the CNC content were found to play an important role in the water uptake, swelling, mechanical properties and hydroxide conductivity. Composite film 40B exhibited superior dimensional stability, higher water uptake, and lower conductivity-normalized swelling ratio compared to previously reported cross-linked AEMs.13,35,36 The results shown in this article demonstrate the great potential of CNC-based composite films as solid electrolytes for alkaline fuel cells. Most importantly, CNCs are predicted to work well with other existing AEMs to reduce their swelling ratio. Further modification of CNCs with suitable cations may result in even greater hydroxide conductivity.
