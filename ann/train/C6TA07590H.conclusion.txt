Conclusions
Ceramic/polymer composite solid electrolytes with flexibility and high ionic conductivity were studied for sodium solid state batteries for the first time. The content of the ceramic filler has a significant effect on the ionic conductivity of the composite electrolytes. A high ionic conductivity of 2.4 mS cm−1 can be obtained at 80 °C. The composite electrolytes also show high thermal stability and electrochemical stability. The Na3V2(PO4)3/CPE/Na solid state battery using the composite electrolyte shows good cycling performance at 80 °C. The electrochemical performance evidenced the advantages of utilizing ceramic/polymer composite solid electrolytes in solid state batteries.
