Synthesis of 17-bromo-3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecan-1-ol (2)
In a 50 mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, hexaethylene glycol (hEG, 10 g, 35.42 mmol) and triphenyl phosphine (4.65 g, 17.71 mmol) were dissolved in 25 mL anhydrous THF at 30 °C. The reactor was purged with nitrogen for 35 min before CBr4 (5.87 g, 17.71 mmol) was added. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 4 hours at 30 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was then concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 50 °C and the crude product was purified by column chromatography with chloroform/methanol (95 : 5 v/v) to give 17-bromo-3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecan-1-ol as slight yellow oil (81%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 3.02 (s, –OH̲), 3.48 (t, –CH̲2–Br), 3.59–3.73 (m, –O–CH̲2–), 3.79 (t, –CH̲2–CH2–Br); 13C NMR (CDCl3, ppm) δ: 30.1, 61.6, 70.2–70.7 (br), 73.0 (–C̲H2–CH2–Br).

Synthesis of POSS-IL
In a 50 mL flame dried flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, POSS (640 mg, 0.63 mmol) and compound 3 (5.48 g, 5.04 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous benzene (20 mL) at room temperature. The reactor was degassed by bubbling with nitrogen for 1 h. 2 drops (14 μL) of the Karstedt catalyst were added subsequently. The mixture was stirred in an oil bath at 50 °C for 48 h. Then the solvent was evaporated on a rotary evaporator and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C to give compound 4. Then 4 was dissolved in DMF (20 mL) and 1-butyl imidazole (2.04 g, 16.43 mmol) was added. The solution was stirred at 40 °C under N2 for 24 h. After the removal of the solvent, the product was mixed with LiTFSI (4.72 g, 16.43 mmol) in anhydrous acetonitrile (20 mL). The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature before the solvent was evaporated. The product was redissolved in dichloromethane and lithium bromide was removed by filtration. The final products were purified by washing with diethyl ether several times, and then the product was dried under vacuum to give final product 6: POSS-IL: 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm) δ: 0.90 (t, –CH̲3), 1.26 (m, –CH2––CH3), 1.78 (m, –CH̲2–CH2–CH3), 3.42–3.60 (m, –O–CH̲2–), 4.20 (t, O–CH2–CH̲2–N–), 4.35 (t, –N––CH2–), 7.78 (d, –N–CH̲CH̲–N–), 9.18 (s, –NCH̲–N–).
Characterization
The chemical structures of the polymers were determined by 1H and 13C NMR on a Bruker AM-300 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectrometer. FTIR spectra were obtained using a Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer. Raman spectra were measured on a Horiba LabRam HR Evolution equipped with an Oxxius DPSS 532 nm laser and a Horiba Synapse EM detector. Analysis of the peak around 742 cm−1 was performed with the 1800 g mm−1 grating which yields a spectral resolution of 0.4 cm−1. We tested for laser beam damage and found that all species measured with Raman were stable even at the maximum incident power of 45 mW. All thermal analysis Raman measurements presented in this paper were performed with an acquisition time of 30 s, a 50 μm confocal pinhole and 2 accumulation to account for any interference. A Linkam HFS600 temperature stage was used to change the environmental temperature and the objective used was an Olympus 50× LMPLFLN with a numerical aperture of 0.5. At each temperature set point there was a wait time of &gt;10 min before each measurement to ensure that the temperature of the sample had stabilized. Pulse field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) diffusion measurements were performed using a Bruker Avance-III-HD-500 MHz, 11.7 T, prodigy probe. Spectrometer frequencies for 7Li and 19F are 194.4 MHz and 470.6 MHz. Signal attenuation parameters: the diffusion delay (Δ) ranges from 0.1–0.6 s, the gradient pulse length (δ) is 6 ms, the gradient pulse magnitude (g) ranges from 0–50 G cm−1, and the relaxation delay is 10 s.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed using a Physical Electronics VersaProbe II instrument equipped with a monochromatic Al kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.7 eV) and a concentric hemispherical analyzer. Charge neutralization was performed using both low energy electrons (&lt;5 eV) and argon ions. The binding energy axis was calibrated using sputter cleaned Cu foil (Cu 2p3/2 = 932.7 eV and Cu 2p3/2 = 75.1 eV). Peaks were charge referenced to the CHx band in the carbon 1 s spectra at 284.8 eV. Measurements were made at a takeoff angle of 45° with respect to the sample surface plane. This resulted in a typical sampling depth of 3–6 nm (95% of the signal originated from this depth or shallower). Quantification was done using instrumental relative sensitivity factors (RSFs) that account for the X-ray cross-section and inelastic mean free path of the electrons. The curves were fitted using a mixed Gaussian/Lorentzian profile.
The glass transition temperature (Tg) was measured on a TA Q100 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range from −80 to 100 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a TA Instrument model Q50 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 from room temperature up to a maximum of 800 °C to study the thermal stability. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was performed on a Rigaku DMAX-Rapid Microdiffractometer equipped with a 2-D detector, also using CuKα radiation. The software routines were used to evaluate the scattering intensity as a function of the diffraction angle of 2θ, or q, defined as q = 4π sin(θ)/λ.
Dynamic shear moduli were measured using an RDS-IIE rheometer. The POSS-IL sample was placed between two parallel plates with a diameter of 25 mm. The shear strain was varied to obtain the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G′′) at room temperature.
The ionic conductivity (σ) was measured by Broadband Dielectric Relaxation Spectroscopy (DRS). Measurements were performed on a Concept 40 system from Novocontrol GmbH over the frequency range of 10 mHz to 10 MHz. The temperature was controlled using a Quatro temperature control system with a precision of greater than ±0.1 °C. All polymers were measured over the temperature range from −25 °C to 80 °C. To prepare samples for DRS measurements, the polymer electrolyte solutions were cast onto stainless steel electrodes and dried under vacuum overnight at 60 °C.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to study the interfacial properties of Li/Li symmetrical cells using a PAR 2273 FRA/potentiostat. The lithium transference number (tLi+) of the electrolyte was also calculated from the results obtained from the Nyquist plots measured by EIS (1 MHz to 100 mHz, 20 mV AC voltage). tLi+ was calculated according to the method reported by Bruce and Vincent30 (a combination of AC impedance and DC polarization measurements) which was widely used for the determination of tLi+ of the polymer–IL–Li salt system.31–33 The equation can be written as tLi+ = Is(V − IiRi)/Ii(V − IsRs), where V is the constant DC voltage applied; Ii and Is are the initial and steady state current, and Ri and Rs are the interfacial resistance before and after DC polarization. A DC voltage of 30 mV was applied to the two lithium electrodes. Voltammetry experiments were performed on a PAR Potentiostat/Galvanostat Model 263A using a sealed cell with synthesized polymer electrolytes sandwiched between a stainless steel disk working electrode and a lithium foil counter/reference electrode aided by a Teflon o-ring spacer with an inner diameter of 1 cm. Tests were done at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 at 25 °C.
Cell assembly and battery performance
The synthesized polymer electrolyte was dissolved in anhydrous THF (11% w/v) in a glove box. LiTFSI was then added to the above solution. Coin cells (CR2032) were assembled in an argon-filled glove box (Labstar MB10, MBRAUN). Li4Ti5O12 (LTO, Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha, Ltd.) and LiFePO4 (LFP, Sud-Chemie) were selected as cathode materials (slurries containing 80 wt% of LTO or LFP, 10 wt% of super P (a carbon additive to enhance electrode conductivity) and 10 wt% of POSS-IL in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) were made and cast onto 9 μm thick copper foil (15 μm thick aluminum foil was used for LFP) followed by the doctor blade method). The areal density of the active material was ca. 2.8 mg cm−2. The cathode sheets were punched into 1 cm diameter (0.785 cm2) disks, vacuum dried at 80 °C completely, weighed, and transferred into a glove box for coin cell assembly. Lithium foils (MTI, 250 μm thick) were used as the anode. The polymer electrolyte solution was cast on the anode and the solvent was evaporated in a glove box leaving the solvent-free polymer electrolyte membrane. The coin cell was assembled by sandwiching the solvent-free polymer electrolyte between the cathode and anode in the coin cell case with a 125 μm ring shaped Teflon spacer. Battery tests were performed on a Neware CT-3008 battery tester. The theoretical capacities of LTO and LFP were 175 mA h g−1 and 170 mA h g−1, respectively.34 An ESPEC BTU-133 temperature chamber was used to change the environmental temperature for the coin cells. The batteries were cycled between 1.3 to 2.0 V for the Li/POSS-IL-LiTFSI/LTO cell and 2.5 to 3.9 V for the Li/POSS-IL-LiTFSI/LFP cell under constant current conditions. A conventional liquid electrolyte (1 M LiTFSI in ethylene carbonate–dimethyl carbonate (EC–DMC, 1 : 1, v/v)) was used as a control in the lithium stripping/plating and galvanostatic polarization tests.
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI NanoSEM 630 FESEM) was used to study the electrode surface morphology.
The flammability test was performed with a Master Microtorch fed with butane flux; inert glass fiber filter strips with 1 cm width and 0.6 μm pore size were soaked in the concentrated POSS-IL solution in anhydrous THF for 5 min. Then these strips were dried and placed at a fixed distance from the microtorch before testing. As a control, the glass fiber filter was also soaked in the liquid electrolyte (1 M LiTFSI EC–DMC, 1 : 1, v/v).
