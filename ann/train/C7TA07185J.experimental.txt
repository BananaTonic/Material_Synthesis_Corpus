Materials
Styrene (St) and n-butyl acrylate (BA) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (SCRC). St was distilled under a reduced pressure to remove inhibitor. BA was washed using aqueous NaOH solution (10 wt%) three times, rinsed with deionized water until neutral, and separated from the solution with molecular sieves. The poly(acrylic acid)20-b-polystyrene5 trithiocarbonate macroRAFT agent was synthesized by following the process reported by Huang.34 Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs, ≧95%, diameter &lt; 2 nm, length 5–30 μm) and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS, 98%, surfactant) were purchased from Aladdin. Carbon black (Super P Li, Timcal), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, SCRC), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF, Arkema), LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 (Shenzhen Kejing Star Technology Co., Ltd.) were used as purchased without further purification.
Synthesis of the triblock copolymer emulsion
The targeted molecular weights of three kinds of poly(St-b-BA-b-St) were 15k–90k–15k, 15k–120k–15k and 15k–150k–15k, respectively. We chose the synthesis of SBAS (15k–90k–15k) as an example of the synthesis process. Firstly, the MacroRAFT agent (1.0 g) was dissolved in deionized water (30 g). Then, St (6.44 g) was added to the solution in a 250 mL flask. After deoxygenation (30 min) by a nitrogen purge, the water bath was set at 70 °C. Then, KPS (0.2318 g, potassium persulfate, initiator) dissolved in deionized water was added to start the emulsion polymerization. After 40 min, NaOH (0.2576 g) in deionized water was injected into the solution. After another 40 min, BA (38.6432 g) was injected to initiate the second period of polymerization which lasted for 80 min. Finally, St (6.44 g) was combined and reacted for 120 min. The poly(St-b-MA-b-St), whose molecular weight was 15k–90k–15k, was synthesized following the procedure reported in the article.35 The solid content of each emulsion was about 30 wt%.
Synthesis of stretchable electrodes
The SWCNT dispersion was prepared by 300 W ultrasonication for 1 h, with the help of SDBS whose concentration was 10 mg mL−1. The final concentration of the SWCNT aqueous dispersion was 2 mg mL−1. Depending on the SWCNT content, the required amount of SWCNT dispersion was magnetically stirred into the SBAS emulsions for 1 h. Then, the whole mixture was poured into a Teflon Petri dish at 35 °C where it formed a coherent film. Once the film formation was completed, the SBAS/SWCNT membrane was washed with deionized water by vacuum filtration until there were no bubbles left. Afterwards, the membrane was placed into a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 12 h and cooled to room temperature at the cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 to eliminate the internal stress of the membrane. The density of the SBAS/SWCNT composite film was in the range of 0.0068–0.0084 g cm−2, and the film thickness was in the range of 80–100 μm. So the average content of the SBAS/SWCNT current collector in the stretchable electrode was around 44 wt%. It was similar to the contents of Al and Cu current collectors in the metal electrodes, which were 37.0 wt% and 47.7 wt%, respectively. The SBAS/SWCNT current collector did not have an advantage regarding the energy density or power density because it is thicker. The LiFePO4 cathode and Li4Ti5O12 anode were made by coating the aqueous slurry of active materials of LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 powders, carbon black, and SMAS/CMC binder with the weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 on the SBAS/SWCNT conductive elastomer, and the weight ratio of SMAS : CMC was 1 : 1. Then the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight to completely remove the dispersion medium. The loading level of active materials was in the range of 5–10 mg cm−2. The thickness of stretchable electrodes was in the range of 120–200 μm. Although it is reported that some side reactions may happen between water and cathode materials such as LiFePO4, in this work, we mainly focus on the research of stretchable electrodes and did not find any distinct negative effects of water on the LiFePO4 stretchable cathode.
Synthesis of conventional metal electrodes
The conventional LiFePO4 cathode and Li4Ti5O12 anode were also made by coating the aqueous slurry of active materials of LiFePO4 and Li4Ti5O12 powders, carbon black, and SMAS/CMC binder with the weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1 on Al foil and Cu foil, respectively. The weight ratio of SMAS : CMC was 1 : 1. The density of Al foil and Cu foil was 0.0055 g cm−2 and 0.0085 g cm−2. Then the electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C overnight to completely remove the water. The loading level of active materials was in the range of 5–10 mg cm−2. The thickness of Al foil and Cu foil was around 70 μm, and the thickness of metal electrodes was in the range of 100–150 μm. The stretchable electrodes and the metal electrodes are kept similar in the loading level of active materials, the thickness of electrodes and the density of current collectors.
Characterization and electrochemical measurements
The number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw), and polydispersity index (PDI = Mw/Mn) were measured by GPC (Waters 1525 binary HPLC pump, Waters 2414 refractive index detector, Waters 717 autosampler). The monomer conversion rate of each block of copolymer was calculated according to the weighing method. A certain amount of emulsion was taken out as a kinetic sample after the reaction of each block, and then the samples were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight. The conversion rates were calculated by recording the mass of the kinetic samples before and after drying. A four-point probe resistivity tester (Guangzhou Kunde Technology Co., Ltd., KDB-1) was used to measure the conductivities of the stretchable elastomers. The mechanical properties of the stretchable elastomers were measured using a Zwick/Roell Z020. The surface and section morphologies of the stretchable electrodes were characterized using a SU-8010 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). To perform TEM measurements, SBAS/SWCNT composite samples were first cut at −140 °C using a Leica UC-7 frozen slicer into thin films with a thickness of around 100 nm. These thin films were then measured using a JEOL JEMACRO-1230 transmission electron microscope directly with an accelerating voltage of 90 kV. Some of them were stained with ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4) vapor at room temperature before measurements for comparison. The TEM samples of SBAS emulsions were stained with osmium tetroxide (RuO4) vapor at room temperature before measurements. The coin cells (CR2025) were assembled in a glovebox filled with argon gas. The electrochemical performance of the cells was measured using a Neware BTS battery test system at 30 °C. The AC impedance spectra were recorded using a CHI660C electrochemical analyzer at 25 °C. For the half cells, the rate (C) here is calculated based on the theoretical capacities of the electrodes (170 mA h g−1 for LFP and 175 mA h g−1 for LTO). For the full cells, the rate is used based on the theoretical capacity of LTO. The capacities of full cells were matched based on the theoretical capacities of LFP and LTO.
