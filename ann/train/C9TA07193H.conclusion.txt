Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized a robust thiophene based POFs with high surface area. The properties of thiophene based POFs were fine-tuned by post modification with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid oxidation in a controlled manner, which resulted in a less effected pore width and additional hydrogen bonding sites in the channel. The decorated hydrogen bond acceptor sulfone groups could enhance the adsorption of ammonia and increase the proton conductivity of phosphoric acid or imidazole infiltrated sulfone containing thiophene based POFs. The post oxidation method could be a useful strategy to fine tune the properties of other POFs.
