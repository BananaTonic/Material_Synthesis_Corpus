Conclusions
In summary, we have rationally designed and prepared black (Sn, Ti)O2 with a core–shell structure (SnxTi1−xO2@SnxTi1−xO2−yHy) through a facile co-precipitation followed by a hydrogen plasma reduction. Importantly, the electrical conductivity of the black (Sn, Ti)O2 sample is 35.7 μS cm−1, over two orders of magnitude higher than the 0.1 μS cm−1 of the white (Sn, Ti)O2 sample. The sub 10 nm scale structure of the black (Sn, Ti)O2 solid solution can be maintained even after 100 cycles, demonstrating a superior host to buffer the volume change. Thus, the black (Sn, Ti)O2 anode harvests a significantly enhanced reversible capacity (583.4 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g−1), high rate performance (419.2 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 and 335.3 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1) and superior cycling stability. Surface modification by a hydrogen plasma reduction is a facile yet effective way to fundamentally improve the electrical conductivity and structure stability of the (Sn, Ti)O2 materials, which could be extended to other functional transition metal oxides. These findings should open up opportunities for high-performance Li-ion batteries.
