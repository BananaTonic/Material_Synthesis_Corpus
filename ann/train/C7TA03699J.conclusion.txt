4.Conclusions
In summary, we fabricated solid-state Li–S batteries using N-doped porous carbon nanosheets as the host material of a sulfur cathode, lithium metal as the anode, and ionic liquid grafted oxide nanoparticle (IL@NPs) modified SSPEs as both electrolyte and binder. We proved that the N-CNs is a kind of carbon material suitable for solid-state Li–S batteries. The PEO–Li–Si, PEO–Li–Ti, and PEO–Li–Zr electrolytes show improved and considerable ionic conductivity compared to the tPEO–Li electrolyte. It should be mentioned that the PEO–Li–Zr electrolyte possessed the highest conductivity of 4.95 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 50 °C and 2.32 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 37 °C. Moreover, the Li–S battery based on the PEO–Li–Zr electrolyte exhibits outstanding stability and electrochemical performance. At 50 °C, the PEO–Li–Zr battery had a stable capacity of 986 mA h g−1. At 37 °C, the discharge capacity remained at 600 mA h g−1 and stayed stable after 80 cycles. Notably, the highly improved capacity and effectively reduced working temperature are superior to many previous works. These results firmly demonstrate that combination of the N-CNs/S cathode and the SSPEs is an effective strategy to enhance battery performance. This strategy may be promising and hopeful for the development of advanced solid-state batteries.
