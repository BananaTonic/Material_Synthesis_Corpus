General instruments
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Brucker AV-400 MHz or AV-500 MHz Fourier transform spectrometer at room temperature. Fast atom bombardment (FB) high resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was performed by the Mass Spectroscopic Laboratory as an in-house service of the Institute of Chemistry, Academia Sinica. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 spectrometer and Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array spectrometer for solution and thin film samples, respectively. The PL spectrum was measured by LP920 flash photolysis spectrometer (Edinburgh Instrument, Kirkton Campus, Livingston, England) at room temperature. A 532 nm green laser (Brilliant B laser, Quantel Company, Newbury, Berkshire, UK) was used as the excitation source in PL measurement. The thin film AFM images were obtained by Digital Instrument D3100CL. The thin film SEM images were characterized by FEI Nova NanoLab™ 600 DualBeam (FIB/SEM).

A mixture of Br-PDI (2 g, 2.82 mmol), KF (2 g, 34.4 mmol), and DMF (125 mL) was stirred at 130 °C for 12 h under argon atmosphere. After the removal of solvent, the residue was subjected to purification by silica gel column chromatography, using CH2Cl2/hexane (3/1, v/v) as an eluent, affording F-PDI (0.82 g) as a red solid in a yield of 50%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 9.06 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz), 8.68 (m, 5H), 8.49 (d, 2H, J = 13.6 Hz), 4.17–4.09 (m, 4H), 1.97 (m, 2H), 1.24–1.53 (m, 16H), 0.94 (t, 6H, J = 7.6 Hz), 0.89 (t, 6H, J = 7.6 Hz). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ ppm: 163.62, 163.45, 163.32, 162.57, 162.52, 162.49, 134.35, 133.83, 131.75, 130.97, 130.33, 128.85, 128.61, 128.30, 128.05, 126.29, 126.06, 123.61, 123.31, 123.08, 122.67, 122.00, 121.68, 44.49, 44.44, 44.37, 37.97, 37.94, 30.79, 30.75, 28.71, 28.67, 24.10, 24.07, 23.08, 23.06, 14.08, 10.63, 10.60. MALDI-MS for C41H43FN2O4, m/z = 646.79, found, m/z = 646.32.
Synthesis of ZnO NPs
ZnO NPs were synthesized by a solution-precipitation process according to literature procedures.43 Briefly, zinc acetate dihydrate (2.95 g) was dissolved in methanol (125 mL) at room temperature. A potassium hydroxide solution (1.48 g in 65 mL methanol) was then added dropwise within 30 min and stirred for 3 h at 65 °C. After cooling, the solution was then decanted and the precipitate was washed twice with ethyl acetate and ethanol, respectively. Afterward, ethanol was added to disperse the precipitates and produce ZnO NPs solution with a concentration of 6 mg mL−1. Before use, the ZnO NPs solution was filtered through a 0.45 mm PVDF syringe filter.
Cyclic voltammetry of X-DPI
Using an Electrochemical Analyser BAS C3 operated at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1, cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were conducted in a tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) supported CH2Cl2 solution containing X-PDI or PC61BM (1.0 × 10−3 M) at room temperature. The measurement was conducted with a glassy carbon rod as the working electrode and a platinum wire as the counter electrode. The Ag–Ag+ (0.1 M of AgNO3 in acetonitrile) was used as the reference electrode. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was used as the reference to calibrate the redox potentials. Fc/Fc+ potential in our CV measurement was +0.10 V relative to Ag–Ag+. For a thin film CV measurement, X-PDI or PC61BM thin film-coated platinum electrode was prepared from a drop-cast chloroform solution. The CV of the X-PDI or PC61BM thin film was studied in an anhydrous and nitrogen-saturated solution of acetonitrile containing 0.10 M Bu4NPF6. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of X-PDI or PC61BM were calculated based on equations, ELUMO = −(Ered11/2 + 5.10) [eV] and EHOMO = ELUMO − Eopg[eV], where Eopg is the optical energy gap corresponding to the absorption onset wavelength of the absorption spectra; the energy level of Fc/Fc+ related to the vacuum level was 5.10 eV, based on literature reports.9,31
Determination of direct current conductivity of X-PDI and PC61BM
The X-PDI or PC61BM thin films were prepared by spin-coating from chloroform solution on an ITO bottom electrode. A layer of Al (100 nm) as the top electrode was then deposited through an area (0.2 × 0.5 cm2) patterned mask in a thermal evaporation chamber under high vacuum (&lt;10−6 Torr). The electrical conductivity was analysed based on the current–voltage characteristics of the thin film. The DC (direct current) conductivity (σ0), which is in units of siemens per meter (S m−1), of the thin film material in such a device can be obtained by the Claude Pouillet law, R = L(σ0A)−1, where the resistance (R) of a given thin film increases with length (L), but decreases with increasing cross-sectional area (A). The σ0 is defined as the inverse of resistivity (ρ, in unit of Ω m), i.e., σ0 = ρ−1.
Electron mobility determination by SCLC
In the case of a field dependent mobility, as described by the Poole–Frenkel effect, the space-charge limited (SCL) current density (JSCL) is given by the modified Mott–Gurney equation,44JSCL = 9ε0εrμVin2 exp(γV1/2L−1/2)(8L3)−1, where ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1); εr is the relative dielectric constant of the thin film, which was assigned as 3; μ is the charge carrier mobility; L is the thickness of the device; Vin is the voltage drop across the sample given by Vin = V − Vbi − Vrs, where V is the applied voltage, Vbi the built-in voltage, and Vrs is the voltage drop due to the series resistance of the contacts; γ is the electric field-activation factor of mobility and accounts for the degree of disorder, particularly the energetic level distribution of the carrier hopping sites in the material. Accordingly, in the region of a log J − log V curve having a slope of ∼2, the μ can be calculated from the intercept of a ln(JL2V−2) − (VL−1)1/2 plot (see Fig. 5b and d), i.e., μ = exp(intercept)8L(9ε0εr)−1. The expression of a field dependent SCL current (SCLC) yields a reasonably good fit to the measured J–V curves of single-carrier devices (see the fitting curves in Fig. 5a and c).45
Fabrication and characterization of perovskite solar cells
ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned stepwise in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under ultra-sonication for 20 min each, and subsequently pre-treated with UV-ozone for 60 min. The PEDOT:PSS layer (25 nm) was spin-coated onto the ITO surface and then annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer (∼380 nm) was prepared following two-step solution deposition, as described in our previous work.35,36 Briefly, PbI2 and MAI were dissolved in DMF and 2-propanol with concentrations of 450 mg mL−1 for PbI2 and 40 mg mL−1 for MAI, respectively. Both solutions and PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO substrates were heated at 100 °C for 10 min before being used. The PbI2 solution was spun on a preheated substrate (5000 rpm for 40 s) and then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. The MAI solution was then spun on top of the dried PbI2 film (6000 rpm for 30 s), followed by annealing at 100 °C for 2 h. The X-PDI solution (15 mg mL−1 in chloroform) was then cast by spin-coating (1000 rpm for 60 s) on top of the preformed perovskite layers. The thickness of X-PDI was near 200 nm. Afterward, the ZnO NPs layer (about 10–20 nm) was deposited by spin-coating ZnO NP precursor solution (3000 rpm for 60 s), then dried in ambient conditions without thermal annealing. The opaque Ag cathode (150 nm) was then deposited from a thermal evaporator under high vacuum (&lt;10−6 Torr). Contributions to the Jsc from regions outside the active area were eliminated using illumination masks with an aperture size of 0.12 cm2. The bulk resistances, Rsh and Rs, of the samples, were calculated from Ohm's law, R = VI−1, with at least ten separate measurements made for each sample.
For the evaluation of the device performance, the devices were illuminated under light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 by using a 150 W Class AAA solar simulator (XES-100S1, SAN-EI). The light intensity was determined by using a standard silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1133), calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The J–V curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. Unless otherwise stated, the scan rate was set at 0.15 V s−1.
From the J–V characteristics of solar cells in dark circumstances, the dark current densities (JD) of a solar cell can be estimated according to the thermionic emission model,39,40JD = J0[exp(qV(nkT)−1)−1], where n is the dark ideality factor, J0 is the reverse saturation current, q is the elementary charge, and kT is the thermal energy (Boltzmann's constant and temperature). It is well known that the ideality factor of PVSC is normally between 1 and 2.41 The ideality factor is close to 1 for an ideal trap-free device, while it is closer to or larger than 2 in the case of the deep and dominant charge recombination induced by the trap.
