Poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC, Mw = 50 000) used in this study was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 was supplied by Shanghai Institute of Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.37,39 Battery-grade lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) was supplied by Suzhou Fotai New Materials Co., Ltd. Other reagents were commercially available.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were characterized in the range of 5–65° and collected with a step-width of 0.01° at 20 °C. The surface morphology of the samples was observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800, operating at 3 kV). All the samples for the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were coated with a very thin gold layer using a sputter coating. The FTIR spectra of the membranes were obtained using the attenuated total reflection (ATR) attachment on a Frontier FTIR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) in the transmission mode from 800 cm−1 to 4000 cm−1, which is collected with 32 scans and a resolution of 4 cm−1. In this study, thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) coupling techniques were used to make a simultaneous characterization study for thermal properties of the polymer electrolyte from 40 °C to 400 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. The stress–stain curves of the samples were measured by an Inston-3300 universal testing machine (USA) at a stretching speed of 1.66 mm s−1 with the sample straps of about 1 cm wide and 8 cm long. The gauge length is 6 cm. The thickness of the solid electrolyte membrane was tested through a screw micrometer. A Zeta Plus (Brookhaven) laser particle size analyzer was used to characterize the particle size distribution of LLZTO.
The electrochemical window of the samples was determined using a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiment at a sweep rate of 1 mV s−1 from 0 V to 5.0 V. Ionic conductivity of the solid polymer electrolytes was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Autolab PGSTAT 302N system) at varied temperatures ranging from 20 °C to 120 °C, which was carried out in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The equation for calculating conductivity is as follows:2σ = L/RbSwhere Rb is the bulk resistance, L is the thickness of solid polymer electrolyte, S is the contact area between the solid polymer electrolyte and the blocking stainless steel electrodes. The lithium ion transference number of the electrolyte was tested in a symmetric cell (Li/electrolytes/Li) using an Autolab PGSTAT 302N system. The symmetric Li/electrolyte/Li battery was polarized at a small voltage of 10 mV. AC impedance plots of the cell before and after polarization were obtained. The tLi+ was estimated using the following equation:3tLi+ = [ISS × (V − IoRo)]/[Io × (V − ISSRSS)]where V is the applied voltage, Io and ISS are initial current and steady-state values, respectively, and Ro and RSS are the electrolyte/electrode interfacial resistance measured before and after DC polarization, respectively.
The LiFePO4 cathode was composed of 80 wt% LiFePO4, 10 wt% PPCL-SPE and 10 wt% carbon black. The thickness of LiFePO4 electrode (without Al current) was 29 μm. The C-rates in all of the electrochemical measurements are defined based on 1C = 170 mA g−1. The LiFePO4/Li solid state battery was charged and discharged between 2.5 V and 4.0 V at varied currents. The Li4Ti5O12 anode was composed of 80 wt% Li4Ti5O12, 10 wt% PPCL-SPE and 10 wt% carbon black. The thickness of the Li4Ti5O12 electrode (without Al current) was 30 μm. The solid LiFePO4/Li4Ti5O12 battery was charged and discharged between 1.0 V and 2.6 V at varied currents. The LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 cathode was composed of 80 wt% LiFe0.2Mn0.8O4, 10 wt% PPCL-SPE, and 10 wt% carbon black. The thickness of the LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4 electrode (without Al current) was 32 μm. The LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4/Li battery was charged and discharged between 2.5 V and 4.4 V at 0.5C (1C = 170 mA g−1).
From the point of view of lithium ion diffusion, two types of solid electrolytes (pristine PPC-SPE and PPCL-SPE) have been chosen for this study. To eliminate the polymer effects, 150 repeating units of the PPC together with one polymer chain were used in the simulation supercell. Therefore, our modeling has been obtained by inserting the LLZTO nanoparticle into the center of the cubic box, which consists of polymer. We used the conjugate-gradient (CG) iteration to minimize the system's energy, after which it was optimized by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in the NVT ensemble for 10 ps. Those atoms in the supercell were employed by the Universal Force Field. To further relax the morphology of the polymer, its energy was minimized again, followed by MD simulation in the NVT ensemble, during which the temperature was 1273 K. Finally, MD simulations in the NVT ensemble were carried out at 300 K, which yielded the equilibrium morphology of the polymer. For comparison, we also evaluated the pristine polymer at the same conditions. The diffusivity coefficients D were obtained through the Einstein relation that relates D to mean-square displacements of the lithium ion.where 〈·〉 represents an average over all the gas molecules and all the possible time origins of their diffusion. R(t) is the position of a gas molecule at time t.
