4Conclusions
In conclusion, trivalent doping of Li2SiP2 is most likely to occur on the Si4+ site rather than the Li+site. Aluminium doping on the silicon site with a charge compensating lithium interstitial is an extremely low energy doping mechanism with an energy barrier to incorporation of ∼0.05 eV. Via this mechanism, the charge compensating  species instigates increased lithium diffusion. Furthermore, doping of up to ∼9%  is possible with very little change in energy per defect pair (+0.01 eV).
The AIMD simulations reveal a high throughput pathway for Li+ diffusion involving only lithium on site 2. This highly curved pathway is however only observed to activate upon migration of a lithium interstitial into the pathway. NEB calculations support the activation of the high-throughput pathway by interstitial Li, showing an exceptionally low energy barrier to migration of 0.05 eV when interstitial Li is included. The migration barriers were significantly higher in the site 2 pathway when the instigating mechanism is instead stoichiometric hops or vacancy hops.
Activation of the site 2 pathway, potentially by intrinsic as well as extrinsic defects, may be the origin of the high ionic conductivity observed experimentally. Future work will be concerned with exploring alternative doping schemes with an eye to generating lithium vacancies (with Mg2+). With diffusion data from lithium vacancies it then becomes possible to definitively ascertain any anisotropy in diffusion arising from either interstitial or vacancy lithium defects.
