Conclusions
We screened the Materials Project database using Pymatgen and obtained 251 NASICON-type compounds with the chemical formula LixM2(PO4)3. Depending on the band gap and binding strength of Li ions, these compounds could be applied as the cathode, anode, or solid electrolyte in Li batteries. Seven series of candidate materials (where M = Bi, Ge, In, Mo, Sb, Sc, and Zr) were further systematically investigated by DFT computation. In terms of stability, electrochemical window, band gap and ionic conductivity, the performance of Li3Sc2(PO4)3 is the best as the solid electrolyte. Among the rest, Li3Bi2(PO4)3 and Li3Sb2(PO4)3 also exhibit high Li ion conductivity but their thermal stability is unsatisfactory. Improving their stability by doping or modification could be the key to utilizing their great ionic conductivity.
This high throughput method combining database and computational studies can greatly improve the efficiency of material exploration, and lay a solid foundation for further experiments. Meanwhile, our approaches could also be extended to various areas, such as the exploration for novel electrode materials. Our work could offer some guidance for further studies on NASICON-type solid electrolytes for Li batteries.
