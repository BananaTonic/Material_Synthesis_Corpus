Conclusion
In conclusion, a novel porous covalent framework based on ether bonds (PCF-1) was synthesized. Taking advantage of the acid–base stability of PCF-1, post-synthetic covalent modification was employed for the introduction of free acidic groups in pursuit of significant improvement in the conductivity. The sulphonated compound (PCF-1-SO3H) shows remarkably high water-mediated conductivity (2.6 × 10−2 S cm−1) with a notable 130-fold increase from the conductivity of the parent compound. The observed value falls in the range of commercially used Nafion and registers as the highest known value in the regime of porous organic framework-like materials on post-synthetic modification. We believe that this approach may open an avenue in the quest of attaining sustainable materials as proton conductors based on porous organic materials.
