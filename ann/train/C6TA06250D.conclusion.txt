Conclusion
In summary, sulfur-doped microporous carbon (SMPC) derived from natural luffa sponge has been successfully synthesized via a facile carbonization and activation procedure, and has been subsequently employed as the interlayer in Li–S batteries. Due to the special physical properties and chemical ingredients of SMPC, the as-fabricated SMPC interlayer for Li–S batteries not only facilitates the mass transport of Li ions and conduction of electrons by offering more electrolyte infiltration and shortening the electron transfer path, but also effectively immobilizes active materials and restricts the dissolution of polysulfides through the combination of strong chemical and physical absorption. Thanks to these functional advantages, Li–S cells with the SMPC polysulfide diffusion inhibitor exhibit a large reversible capacity of 1544.2 mA h g−1 at 0.2C, a high rate capacity of 781.2 mA h g−1 at 5C, and superior cyclability over 500 cycles at 2C with 0.057% capacity fading per cycle. For this advanced configuration with a high sulfur loading of 2.5 mg cm−2, a reversible capacity of 738.1 mA h g−1 after 250 cycles at 1C is also achieved. With the additional merits of being low cost, abundant, facile and readily available, the SMPC interlayer may be a promising alternative for the large-scale production of Li–S batteries.
