Conclusion
In summary, a series of crosslinked poly(4-vinylphenol)-based membranes was successfully prepared. A facile crosslinking method using BHMC as the crosslinker was first adopted in the preparation of AEMs, leading to a constriction of the WU and SR. Besides, an all-carbon backbone endows the membrane with robust alkaline stability, and the remaining ionic conductivity was up to 91.3% after immersion in a 2 M KOH solution for 480 h. Additionally, the maximum ionic conductivity of the QAPVP-5% membrane (IEC of 2.12 meq g−1) was 78 mS cm−1. The peak power density of a single cell using the QAPVP-5% membrane was 122 mW cm−2 at a current density of 350 mA cm−2. All the results indicate that the membranes designed in this paper have a promising future in application for fuel cells.
