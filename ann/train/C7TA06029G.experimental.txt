Tetrahydrofuran (THF, HPLC grade, Honeywell) was dried over molecular sieves (Acros; 4 Å, 8–12 mesh) before use. Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO, Sigma-Aldrich, Mn = 20 kg mol−1, MwMn−1 = 2.3), n-butyllithium (n-BuLi, 2.5 M, solution in hexanes, Acros), dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), chloroform-d (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,6-dibromohexane (98%, Acros), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, reagent grade, Acros), trimethyl amine (TMA, 7.3 M aq. solution, Acros), quinuclidine (Qui, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich), N-methylpiperidine (Pip, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), N-methylpyrrolidine (Pyr, 97%, Sigma-Aldrich), 4-methylmorpholine (Mor, 98+%, Sigma-Aldrich), azepane (Aze, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 2,6-dimethylpiperidine (2,6DMPip, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 3,5-dimethylpiperidine (3,5DMPip, 96+%, Sigma-Aldrich), 4-methylpiperidine (4MPip, 96+%, Sigma-Aldrich), N-methyldipropylamine (DPMA, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), iodomethane (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), diethyl ether (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium nitrate (99%, Sigma), sodium bromide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), methanol (MeOH, HPLC grade, Honeywell) and 2-propanol (IPA, HPLC grade, Honeywell) were all used as received. Silver nitrate (99 995%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dried under vacuum at 30 °C in the dark before use.
Bromoalkylation of PPO
A sample of PPO modified with bromopentyl side chains was prepared via lithiation and subsequent bromoalkylation, as described previously (Scheme 1).22 The degree of bromination (DB) was targeted at ∼30 bromoalkyl chains per 100 repeating units of PPO by controlling the degree of lithiation. A 4-neck 500 mL round bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer and a mechanical stirrer fitted with an argon/vacuum line was filled with PPO (4 g, 33.29 mmol repeat units) and dry THF (400 mL). The content was heated to 60 °C and kept for 40 min to fully dissolve the PPO and was then allowed to cool to room temperature before being degassed using 7 vacuum/argon cycles. A few droplets of n-BuLi solution were slowly added until the solution turned pale yellow in order to consume any remaining reactive impurities. Next, 24 mL of n-BuLi (60 mmol) was added dropwise and the color quickly turned dark-yellow and insoluble lithiated PPO began to precipitate out of the solution. The reaction mixture was then heated to 55 °C and left for 3 h with stirring until a homogeneous orange-red solution formed. After cooling to room temperature, the flask was transferred to an isopropanol/dry ice bath for 30 min to cool to −70 °C. The lithiated PPO was then quenched by quickly injecting a 200% molar excess of 1,4-dibromohexane (based on the amount of added n-BuLi). The bromoalkylation reaction occurred immediately, followed by a change of color back to pale yellow. The solution was left stirring overnight until finally obtaining a colorless solution to ensure complete reaction. Next, the solution was added dropwise to methanol to obtain a fine white precipitate of the product, designated as PPO5-Br. After filtration, the polymer was washed repeatedly with methanol and dried under vacuum at 50 °C until a constant weight was obtained. The organolithium synthesis was straightforward and efficient and the bromoalkylation reaction resulted in a very high yield (∼100%). No gel formation was observed when dissolving the PPO5-Br in common solvents such as THF, NMP and chloroform.
Preparation of PPO functionalized with different QA cations either by reaction of bromoalkylated PPO with the corresponding secondary (cyclic) amine, followed by reaction with iodomethane (samples PPO5-QA1+), or by direct reaction with corresponding tertiary (cyclic) amines (samples PPO5-QA2+). In addition, PPO samples with QA cations in benzylic positions (samples PPO5-QA3+) were prepared by reacting benzyl brominated PPO with the corresponding tertiary amine. All polymers were subsequently ion-exchanged to the OH− form after AEM fabrication.
Introduction of QA cations
Two different pathways were employed to functionalize PPO with 10 different QA cations on pentyl alkyl spacers (Scheme 1). This included 8 different hetero-cycloaliphatic QA cations. Because the same bromoalkylated precursor PPO was used throughout the work, the ion exchange capacity (IEC) varied only slightly, mainly depending on the different molecular weights of the QA cations. Consequently the IEC was kept in a narrow range (1.72–1.90 mequiv. g−1, see Table 1) for all AEMs.

In this way PPO was tethered with 1,4-dimethylpiperidinium (designated as PPO5-4MPip), 1,3,5-trimethylpiperidinium (PPO5-3,5DMPip) and 1,2,6-trimethylpiperidinium (PPO5-2,6DMPip), as well as 1-methylazepanium (PPO5-Aze). This pathway is illustrated by the synthesis of the latter sample in which 0.8 g of PPO5Br-31 (1.38 mmol of Br) and 0.41 g of azepane (4.14 mmol, 200% excess) were dissolved in 16 g of NMP to form a homogeneous solution. After heating to 85 °C, the solution was stirred for 7 days to fully substitute the terminal Br atoms with tertiary azepane rings. The homogeneous solution was then poured into diethyl ether (500 mL) and the intermediate was collected by filtration, washed intensively with diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight. Next, the polymer was weighed and dissolved in NMP to form a 5 wt% solution before adding an excess amount of iodomethane (&gt;200%). The solution was stirred for 2 days in the dark and then added dropwise into diethyl ether to precipitate PPO5-Aze. To convert to the Br− form, the sample was soaked in 200 mL of 1 M aq. NaBr at 50 °C under stirring for at least 48 h. After washing intensively with de-ionized water, the product was dried under vacuum for at least 2 days before further use.
Following the second pathway, the QA cations were introduced by directly substituting the Br atoms of PPO5-Br in Menshutkin reactions with the corresponding tertiary amine. In this way, PPO was tethered with 1-methylpyrrolidinium (designated as PPO5-Pyr), 1-methylpiperidinium (PPO5-Pip), 1-methylmorpholinium (PPO5-Mor), quinuclidinium (PPO5-Qui), dipropylmethylammonium (PPO5-DPMA) and trimethylammonium (PPO5-TMA) QAs, respectively. The latter two samples were included as reference materials to the samples carrying the different hetero-cycloaliphatic QA cations. The preparation of PPO5Q-Qui is described here. An amount of 16 g of NMP was first added to 0.8 g of PPO5-Br (1.38 mmol of Br) and 0.47 g of quinuclidine (4.14 mmol, 200% excess) and the mixture was stirred to form a homogeneous solution. Next, the solution was kept at 85 °C for 7 days under stirring to ensure complete quaternization. The homogeneous orange-red solution was added dropwise into diethyl ether (500 mL) and the product was collected by filtration, washed repeatedly with diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum at room temperature to a constant weight.
In addition, a PPO containing an average of 23 bromobenzyl groups per 100 repeating units (PPO1-Br, DB = 23) was reacted with N-methylpiperidine and trimethylamine, respectively, to introduce 1-methylpiperidinium and trimethylammonium QAs in samples PPO1-Pip and PPO1-TMA, respectively. The preparation followed our previously reported method,21,23 and the DB value of the precursor polymer was chosen to reach IECs close to the other samples in the present study (Table 1).
Structural characterization
1H NMR spectra of the different polymers were recorded in chloroform-d (δ = 7.26 ppm) or DMSO-d6 (δ = 2.50 ppm) solutions, using a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer operating at 400.13 MHz. The number and weight average molecular weight values (Mn and Mw, respectively) of the brominated PPOs were evaluated using HPLC-grade chloroform as an eluent at room temperature in a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) system with a series of three Shodex gel columns (KF-805, −804 and −802.5) and a refractive index detector. Standard polystyrenes of known molecular weights with low polydispersities (Mn = 650 kg mol−1 from Water Associates, and Mn = 96 and 30 kg mol−1 from Polymer Laboratories, and Mn = 3.18 kg mol−1 from Agilent Technologies) were used for the calibration. An amount of 5 mg dry polymer was first dissolved in 1 mL of chloroform and passed through a Teflon filter with pore size 0.45 μm. Finally, 200 μL of the sample solution was injected and analyzed at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1.
Membrane preparation
An amount of 0.15 g of each cationic polymer in the Br− form was dissolved in 3 g of NMP to form a homogeneous solution. After pouring the solution onto a Petri dish, AEM formation was achieved in a well-ventilated casting oven at 80 °C in 48 h. The membrane was removed from the dish, washed repeatedly, and stored in de-ionized water before further measurements. In order to obtain the OH− form, the AEM was immersed in 1 M aq. NaOH and kept for at least 48 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The NaOH solution was exchanged at least 3 times to ensure complete removal of any traces of remaining Br− ions. The AEMs had an average thickness of ∼70 μm.
Thermal characterization
The thermal stability of the polymers was studied using a TA Instruments TGA Q500 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The sample was first dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for at least 48 h. Next, the sample was kept isothermally at 150 °C for 10 min in the TGA to remove any traces of absorbed water. TGA measurements were performed at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature interval 50–600 °C under a 60 mL min−1 nitrogen flow. The thermal decomposition temperature (Td,95) was noted at 5% weight loss. DSC measurements were performed with a model Q2000 DSC analyzer from TA Instruments to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the brominated precursor polymers. Data were collected during the following cycle: 20 → 280 → 50 → 280 °C. The upper limit of 280 °C was based on the decomposition temperature obtained by TGA.
Determination of ion exchange capacity and water uptake
The theoretical IEC (IECNMR) values of the AEMs in the Br− form were calculated from the 1H NMR spectrum of the PPO5-Br and PPO1-Br precursors, assuming that the respective quaternization reaction reached full conversion. The IECNMR values in the OH− form were also calculated assuming that all Br− ions of the polymer were exchanged to OH− ions. The experimental IEC (IECtitr) of the AEMs was determined by Mohr titrations as follows. The sample was dried under vacuum for at least 48 h. Next, 0.050 g of the sample was stored in 0.2 M aq. NaNO3 (25.00 mL) under stirring for at least 48 h until all Br− ions were completely exchanged from the sample. A 5.0 mL volume of the solution was taken and titrated with 0.01 M aq. AgNO3 using K2CrO4 as the indicator. The end point of the titration was observed by the formation of the Ag2CrO4 precipitate, followed by a color change from yellow to stable reddish brown. The procedure was repeated 3 times to calculate the average value of IECtitr.
The dry weight of the AEM sample in the Br− form (WBr) was measured after drying at 50 °C for at least 48 h in a vacuum oven. Based on the value of the IECtitr and the dry weight WBr, the dry weight in the OH− form (WOH) was calculated. The wet weight in the OH− form was measured by the following procedure. The dried sample in the Br− form was first kept in a large excess of degassed 1 M aq. NaOH solution for at least 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The NaOH solution was exchanged twice during this period. Next, the sample was immersed in 200 mL de-ionized water for at least 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The water used was repeatedly exchanged (4–6 times) with fresh de-ionized water every 2 h until the rinsed water reached neutral pH. The sample was then kept in de-ionized water for an additional 24 h under a nitrogen flow. Finally, the wet weight in the OH− form (W′OH) was noted after wiping off excess water with tissue paper. The water uptake (WUOH) was calculated as:1
Subsequently, the membrane in the OH− form was recovered by immersing the sample in 1 M degassed aq. NaOH solution again for at least 4 h. Using a similar procedure to that described above, the water uptake was measured at 40, 60, and 80 °C, respectively by soaking the sample in de-ionized water under argon at different temperatures.
The hydration number (λ), i.e. the number of water molecules per QA cation, was calculated as:2
Conductivity measurements
The OH− conductivity (σOH) measurements were performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) employing a Novocontrol high resolution dielectric analyzer 1.01S in the frequency range 10−1 to 10−7 Hz at 50 mV. The membrane sample was first cut into a 1.4 cm × 1.4 cm piece and soaked in a closed vial containing 100 mL 1 M aq. NaOH for 48 h under nitrogen to obtain the AEM in the OH− form. The NaOH solution was exchanged with fresh solutions three times. Subsequently, the sample was transferred into a beaker containing 200 mL of de-ionized water and kept for at least 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The rinsing water was repeatedly exchanged (4–6 times) with new fresh de-ionized water every 2 h until it reached neutral pH. Finally, OH− conductivity measurements were performed under immersed conditions using a two-probe method during the cycle: 20 → 80 → −20 → 80 °C.
Small angle X-ray scattering
The morphology (ionic clustering) of the AEMs was analyzed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. First, the membrane in the Br− form was cut into a 2 cm × 0.5 cm piece and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 24 h. Next, SAXS measurements were carried out using a SAXSLab ApS instrument (JJ-Xray, Denmark) equipped with a microfocus sealed X-ray tube and a Pilatus detector. The scattering vector (q) was calculated as:3where l (1.542 Å) is the wavelength of the CuK(α) radiation used and 2q is the scattering angle. The characteristic distance between scattering centers (d) was determined as:4
Evaluation of alkaline stability
The alkaline stability was studied by monitoring the structural degradation of the membrane polymers by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Three sample pieces of in total ∼10 mg were cut from each membrane and soaked in 350 mL of degassed 1 M aq. NaOH under a nitrogen atmosphere at 90 °C. The NaOH solution was exchanged with fresh solution every 3 days. After specified time periods of 4, 8 and 16 days, respectively, a sample piece was taken out and washed extensively with de-ionized water to remove any residual NaOH. In order to convert to the Br− form, the sample was soaked in 1 M aq. NaBr at 60 °C for at least 48 h under stirring. The NaBr solution was exchanged with fresh solutions at least 3 times during the ion exchange process. Next, any residual NaBr salt in the sample was removed by extensive washing and storing in de-ionized water under stirring for 24 h. Prior to the NMR measurements, the sample was first dried for at least 24 h at 50 °C under vacuum, before gently dissolving it in DMSO-d6 under heating. To complement the NMR data, the alkaline stability was also studied by TGA analysis. Three weighed samples (∼10 mg) were treated with an excess of degassed 1 M aq. NaOH under nitrogen at 90 °C for 4, 8 and 16 days, respectively. The next steps followed the same procedure described above for the NMR evaluation, including the ion-exchange and drying. However, the final AEM sample (∼3 mg) was directly analyzed by TGA, as described above.
