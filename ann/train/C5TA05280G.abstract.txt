We investigate and discuss the proton conductivity properties of the cyanide-bridged metal–organic framework (MOF) [Nd(mpca)2Nd(H2O)6Mo(CN)8]·nH2O (where mpca is 5-methyl-2-pyrazinecarboxylate). This MOF is one of an exciting class of cyanide-bridged materials that can combine porosity with magnetism, luminescence, and proton conductivity. Specifically, we show that this material features highly hydrophilic open channels filled with water molecules. They enable a high proton conductivity, as much as 10−3 S cm−1. A rich hydrogen-bonding network, formed by the ligands' carboxylate groups with both coordinated and lattice water molecules, facilitates this high proton conductivity. Combined thermogravimetric studies, FTIR spectroscopy and PXRD analysis show that upon heating at 80 °C, the lattice water molecules are removed without any change in the framework. Further heating at 130 °C results in a partial removal of the coordinated water molecules, while still retaining the original framework. These activated MOFs shows an increasing conductivity from ∼10−9 S cm−1 to ∼10−3 S cm−1 when the relative humidity increases from 0% to 98%. Our studies show that the increase in proton conductivity is correlated with the re-hydration of the framework with lattice water molecules. The Arrhenius activation energy for the proton conductivity process is low (Ea = 37 kJ mol−1), indicating that the protons “hop” through the channels following the Grotthuss mechanism. The fact that this MOF is remarkably stable both under high humidity conditions and at relatively high temperatures (up to 130 °C) makes it a good candidate for real-life applications.
