Sample preparation
La0.95Fe0.8Mg0.2O3 (LFM), La0.95Fe0.8Mg0.05Ti0.15O3 (LFMT) and La0.95Fe0.8Ni0.05Ti0.15O3 (LFNT) were synthesised via a conventional solid-state method.27 Stoichiometric amounts of precursors (La2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, NiO and TiO2, Macklin, 99.9%) were weighed and mixed in an agate mortar for 30 minutes and then the admixture was pelletized at 140 MPa for better contact between the particles. The pellets were fired at 1250 °C in ambient air for 5 hours to obtain a monophasic material. Raw powders of LFMT and LFNT were obtained by crushing the pellet, and the particle size was further refined by grinding in a zirconia jar of a planetary ball-milling machine at 360 revolutions per minute for 1 hour. A dense La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O2.85 (LSGM) electrolyte was prepared via the pressing of a commercial powder and calcination at 1500 °C for 5 hours.28 La0.8Sr0.2CoO3 (LSC) powder for the cathode was synthesised via the combustion method28,29 where the precursors La(NO3)3·9H2O (Macklin, 99%), SrCO3 (Aladdin, 99.5%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Macklin, 99%) and citrate acid (1 : 1 to the cation in molar ratio) as the complexing agent were dissolved in diluted HNO3 to obtain a clear solution, which was then dried at 80 °C on a hotplate. After the evaporation of water, the gel was ignited at 350 °C and the ashes were collected and calcined at 900 °C to obtain powder particles with sizes in nanometres.
Characterization
Room-temperature X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the sample was performed on a monochromatic diffractometer (Kα1 = 1.5406 Å, Persee XD-3, China) in the 2θ range from 15° to 90° with a step size of 0.02°. For compatibility with LSGM, LFNT or LFMT was mixed with LSGM in a 1 : 1 weight ratio and pelletized under 140 MPa before sintering at 900, 1000 and 1100 °C for 5 hours and then XRD was performed. The pellet from solid-state synthesis was cut into bars of 5 mm × 3 mm × 10 mm (around 20% porosity) to which four Ag wires (0.25 mm in diameter, Alfa Aesar, 99.99%) were attached, and the direct-current (DC) conductivity was recorded against temperature using a high-accuracy multimeter (Keithley 2100, USA). The conductivity of the sample was measured in air upon heating but in Ar–5% H2 upon cooling after 5 hours of isothermal reduction at 800 °C and the oxygen partial pressure, P(O2), around the sample was monitored using a P(O2) sensor made of a 3 mol%-Y2O3 stabilised zirconia tube and two Pt electrodes. The ionic conductivity of the LFM pellet (8 mm in diameter and 2.5 mm in thickness) was measured by sandwiching the pellet between two dense Y0.16Zr0.84O1.84 (8YSZ) pellets (10 mm in diameter and 1.8 mm in thickness) as electron-blocking electrodes after 10 hours of reduction.30 Silver paste was plastered onto the surface of the pellets to avoid interface contact resistance. Because the 8YSZ pellets were considered to be of pure ionic conductivity, the stable DC conductivity that was obtained after a bias was applied on the electrode was considered as ionic conductivity. The ionic conductivity of LFM can be calculated since the conductivity of 8YSZ is already known.31 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the reduced samples was obtained on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi spectrophotometer using 150 W Al Kα radiation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with a JSM 7500 (JEOL, Japan) field-emission microscope and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a JFM 2100 microscope (JEOL, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
Cell fabrication and testing
The powdered perovskites were mixed with an equal amount of a vehicle containing 95 wt% terpineol (95%, mixed polymorphs) and 5 wt% polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mw = 1 300 000) for the slurry. The slurry was homogenized using an agate mortar before being applied on both sides of a dense LSGM electrolyte and then the cell was calcined in air at 1100 °C for two hours to give an electrode of 0.5 cm2 in area. A symmetrical cell was employed to measure the Rp of the electrode in pure H2 or Ar–5%H2via electrochemical impedance between 500 °C and 800 °C during the cooling times.
A whole cell containing an LSC cathode and LFNT anode on the LSGM electrolyte was used to obtain the discharge curve and impedance spectra at 800 °C, 750 °C and 700 °C. The LSC cathode was calcined at 950 °C for two hours on the LSGM electrolyte after the calcination of the anode at 1100 °C. The cell was mounted onto an alumina tube using a ceramic bond and a humidified H2 gas flow (20 mL min−1) was introduced at 600 °C upon heating to 800 °C. The cell performance was measured after the anode was reduced at 800 °C for more than 5 hours. The chronoamperometry and impedance spectroscopy were measured on a Zennium Pro electrochemical workstation using a sine wave of 10 mV in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 48 mHz and the data were analysed using the Z-man software accompanying the electrochemical workstation.
