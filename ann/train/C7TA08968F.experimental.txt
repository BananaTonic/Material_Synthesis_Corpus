Results and discussion
With the matproj package of Pymatgen, we found 251 NASICON-type compounds with the chemical formula LixM2(PO4)3, where x could be from 1 to 5 and M is distributed mainly over Bi, Co, Cr, Fe, Ge, In, Mn, Nb, Ni, Sb, Sc, Ti, V, and Zr. Several compounds (where M = Fe, Ge, In, Sc, V, Sn, Ti, and Zr) have ICSD (Inorganic Crystal Structure Database) numbers, indicating that these materials have been experimentally achieved. However, besides the materials mentioned above, some compounds without ICSD numbers are high-temperature stable phases or ones that have been reported in experiments but not included in the ICSD yet.
As shown in Fig. 1, the crystal structure of LixM2(PO4)3 is complicated and varied, and the monoclinic structure shows the greatest percentage of 62.15%, followed by triclinic (20.32%), trigonal (8.76%), orthorhombic (6.37%), cubic (1.99%), and tetragonal (0.40%). In terms of space group, the percentage of P21/c (#14) is the largest (21.91%), followed by C2/c (#15) (13.94%) and P1̄ (#2) (13.55%). In the remaining part, R3̄ (#148) and R3̄c (#167) belonging to the trigonal (also called rhombohedral) structure are also important, due to the common phase transition between monoclinic and rhombohedral observed in experiments. Most importantly, the NASICON-type compounds of P21/c, R3̄, and R3̄c have been extensively studied in experiments; thus LixM2(PO4)3 with these three space groups are the main subjects to be investigated in the following sections.

For solid electrolytes, an adequate band gap for electronic insulation is necessary. According to the band gap value obtained from the MP, with a band gap of 3.50 eV as the rescreening criteria, we found seven compounds that could be applied as the solid electrolyte: Li3Bi2(PO4)3, LiGe2(PO4)3, Li3In2(PO4)3, Li3Mo2(PO4)3, Li3Sb2(PO4)3, Li3Sc2(PO4)3, and LiZr2(PO4)3.
From the MP database, nine Li3Bi2(PO4)3 and five LiBi2(PO4)3 were obtained. However, the positive Ehull indicates that all phases of LixBi2(PO4)3 are thermodynamically metastable at 0 K. Li3Bi2(PO4)3 could decompose into BiPO4 and Li3PO4, and LiBi2(PO4)3 has a tendency to form BiPO4, LiPO3 and O2. The most energetically favorable Li3Bi2(PO4)3 (mp-684504) is monoclinic with space group P21/c, while LiBi2(PO4)3 (mp-504151) is a triclinic phase with space group P2̄. A metastable LiBi2(PO4)3 (mp-585241) shows the same space group, P21/c, as Li3Bi2(PO4)3, and could be regarded as the extraction/insertion of a pair of Li with Li3Bi2(PO4)3. As the electrode material, the electrochemical reaction might be9LiBi2(PO4)3 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li3Bi2(PO4)3with a voltage of 4.68 V vs. Li/Li+. However, most conventional organic electrolytes cannot bear such a high electrode potential, which leads to serious limitations on the application of Li3Bi2(PO4)3 as an electrode material. Besides the Li3Bi2(PO4)3 mentioned above, two additional Li3Bi2(PO4)3 isomers show the same space group of P21/c (mp-27069 and mp-780333). These three isomers exhibit similar atomic structures, and thermodynamic and electronic properties. The main difference is the arrangement of Li ions. At appropriate temperatures, phase transitions between them are quite expectable.
LiGe2(PO4)3 has been widely studied as an electrode material and solid electrolyte for Li batteries. As a conversion electrode material, LiGe2(PO4)3 exhibits a specific capacity of 460 mA h g−1 with a Li ion conductivity of 7.2 × 10−7 S cm−1.23 However, its application as a solid electrolyte is more common than as an electrode material. From the MP, two LiGe2(PO4)3 isomers were obtained with space groups R3̄c (mp-541272) and R3̄ (mp-1021510). The isomer with space group R3̄c has smaller Ehull, which indicates that it is more thermodynamically stable. By comparison, these two isomers are almost identical in terms of atomic structure. They have similar lattice parameters and formation energies, and they only exhibit a very slight difference in the angles of GeO6 and PO4 groups. Similar to Li3Bi2(PO4)3, LiGe2(PO4)3 isomers are thermodynamically metastable at 0 K and tend to form Li4P2O7, Ge5P6O25 and GeP2O7. The Li4P2O7 phase could be observed from LiGe2(PO4)3 at high temperature through X-ray diffraction (XRD).23,24
The earliest investigation of Li3In2(PO4)3 began in 1987.25 According to the annealing temperature, Li3In2(PO4)3 would exhibit mainly two different lattice structures: one is monoclinic (high temperature phase), and the other is rhombohedral (low temperature phase).26 Generally, the low temperature phase exhibits better stability than the high temperature phase, which coincides with the data from the MP. Two Li3In2(PO4)3 isomers (mp-6425 and mp-14488) were obtained. The former has a rhombohedral structure with space group R3̄, and an Ehull of 0 eV indicates that rhombohedral Li3In2(PO4)3 is thermodynamically stable at 0 K. The latter is a monoclinic metastable phase with a rather small Ehull of 0.003 eV and has been experimentally confirmed to be stable.
Although Li3Mo2(PO4)3 and LiMo2(PO4)3 were successfully prepared in 1999,27 there are very few relative experimental studies on them. At room temperature, Li3Mo2(PO4)3 could mainly crystallize in two structural types: rhombohedral (β-Li3Mo2(PO4)3) and monoclinic (α-Li3Mo2(PO4)3).27 α-Li3Mo2(PO4)3 is of space group P21/c, and at 558 K, it could pass through a phase transition to α′-Li3Mo2(PO4)3 which is isostructural with α-Li3Mo2(PO4)3. Both β-Li3Mo2(PO4)3 and LiMo2(PO4)3 crystallize in space group R3̄c. Simulations could reproduce similar results. From the MP, five Li3Mo2(PO4)3 and seven LiMo2(PO4)3 were obtained. Among them, the most stable phases of Li3Mo2(PO4)3 (mp-32098) and LiMo2(PO4)3 (mp-32104) are rhombohedral and monoclinic with space group R3̄ and P21/c, respectively, and both are thermodynamically stable at 0 K. Although no Li3Mo2(PO4)3 phase with space group R3̄c could be found, the rhombohedral one obtained from the MP presents a similar atomic structure and lattice parameter to the experimental data of β-Li3Mo2(PO4)3. Besides the rhombohedral phase, we also got two monoclinic Li3Mo2(PO4)3 isomers with space group P21/c. They have the same framework structure and similar formation energies, but the arrangements of Li ions in them are different. In terms of electrode materials for LIBs, the thermodynamically metastable P21/c Li3Mo2(PO4)3 (mp-32111) and LiMo2(PO4)3 (mp-32104) could be regarded as the same electrode material under Li extraction/insertion without phase transition. The electrochemical reaction might be10LiMo2(PO4)3 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li3Mo2(PO4)3with a voltage of 3.24 V. This voltage, compared with that of Li3Bi2(PO4)3, is relatively mild for organic electrolytes. However, considering the semiconducting nature, it seems essential to add additional conductive agents into Li3Mo2(PO4)3 for electrode preparation.
Nine Li3Sb2(PO4)3 and one LiSb2(PO4)3 were obtained from the MP database. The positive Ehull indicates that none of them are thermodynamically stable at 0 K. The most energetically favorable phase of Li3Sb2(PO4)3 (mp-684539) is monoclinic with space group P21/c and tends to form SbPO4 and Li3PO4 at 0 K, while LiSb2(PO4)3 (mp-684508) is isostructural with Li3Sb2(PO4)3 and tends to form LiPO3, SbPO5, and SbPO4. Besides, the remaining three Li3Sb2(PO4)3 isomers (mp-761135, mp-761135, and mp-762044) which belong to space groups R3̄ and P21/c were also screened out. In the application as electrode materials, the reaction might be11LiSb2(PO4)3 + 2Li+ + 2e− → Li3Sb2(PO4)3with a voltage of 3.36 V, which is similar to that of Li3Mo2(PO4)3.
As a novel Li ion conductor, Li3Sc2(PO4)3 has been widely studied in experiments. Li3Sc2(PO4)3 has three different phases, and with increasing the temperature, the phase transition from α to β to γ could be observed.28 α and β phases have similar lattice parameters to the same space group P21/c and the main difference is the arrangement of Li ions. At high temperature, the γ phase could be obtained with space group Pbcn and here Li ions show a completely disordered state. In experiments, this high temperature (γ) phase is regarded as a superionic conduction phase which could be stabilized at room temperature by substitution of Sc with other transition metals, such as Ti, Zr, Nb, and Ta.29,30 From the MP database, two Li3Sc2(PO4)3 isomers (mp-6565 and mp-774742) were obtained and both are monoclinic with space group P21/c. In these two isomers, three different 4e positions are available for Li ions, and their lattice parameters and atomic structures are almost the same, which are consistent with the experimental results.28,30 Due to the disordered state of Li ions, no relevant information on the γ phase was obtained from the Materials Project.
Based on the difference of the heating temperature during preparation, LiZr2(PO4)3 shows two main crystal types.31 The high temperature phase, heated at 1200 °C, exhibits a NASICON-type structure with a monoclinic system. A clear phase transition occurs at ∼50 °C from monoclinic to rhombohedral.32 The monoclinic and rhombohedral structures could be found from the MP. Among the obtained LiZr2(PO4)3 compounds, mp-10499 is the most thermodynamically stable and exhibits a monoclinic system with space group P21/c, while mp-541661 is rhombohedral with space group R3̄c and the phase transition energy from monoclinic to rhombohedral is about 27 kJ mol−1.
The most thermodynamically stable phases of each series of LixM2(PO4)3 compounds, Li3Bi2(PO4)3 (mp-684504), LiGe2(PO4)3 (mp-541272), Li3In2(PO4)3 (mp-6425), Li3Mo2(PO4)3 (mp-32098), Li3Sb2(PO4)3 (mp-684539), Li3Sc2(PO4)3 (mp-6565), and LiZr2(PO4)3 (mp-10499), are the main subjects in the following sections. The atomic structure and lattice information are illustrated in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The optimized lattice parameters are in good agreement with the experimental results. As shown in Fig. 2, NASICON-type LixM2(PO4)3 compounds are three-dimensional framework structures, where the MO6 octahedrons and PO4 tetrahedrons sharing the corner O atoms are the basic structural units. Obvious distortion of MO6 octahedrons could be found in some metastable phases, such as Li3Bi2(PO4)3 and Li3Sb2(PO4)3, while in other stable structures the shapes of the octahedrons are relatively regular. These results indicate that BiO6 and SbO6 octahedrons are not very stable and could be easily affected by ambient PO4 groups and Li ions. The degree of regularity of the structure could more or less reflect the stability of the structures.

Considering the intrinsic gap underestimation in the GGA method, the band gaps of these materials should be larger. As shown in Fig. 3, the VBM (valence band maximum) of LixM2(PO4)3 mainly consists of O orbitals, while the CBM (conduction band minimum) is mainly composed of O and M orbitals. The overlap of the bands between O, P and M could be observed, which indicates the high degree of orbital hybridization. The contribution of Li to the total DOS is rather small.

To further understand the performances of LixM2(PO4)3 as solid electrolytes, the EW and Li ion conductivity (σ) were estimated by computations. The EW is a voltage range where LixM2(PO4)3 compounds are either lithiated or delithiated, and is one of the main characteristics of solid electrolytes. Normalized by the Li chemical potential of Li metal, the plots of Li evolution per formula unit of LixM2(PO4)3 against the voltage could be obtained from Li grand potential phase diagrams and are shown in Fig. 4a. In view of the overall point, all LixM2(PO4)3 compounds exhibit a rather high reduction potential, which indicates the intrinsic instability of LixM2(PO4)3 against Li metal (0 V) and interfacial coating layer materials are necessary to prevent reactions between LixM2(PO4)3 and Li metal. Most LixM2(PO4)3 compounds have a wide EW ranging from ∼2 to ∼4 V, except for Li3Mo2(PO4)3 and Li3Sb2(PO4)3. The internal combination of Li ions with these two kinds of compounds is not strong, i.e., the chemical potential of Li ions in them is high. Thus with increasing the voltage, it is easier for delithiation oxidation reactions to occur for Li3Mo2(PO4)3 and Li3Sb2(PO4)3, and these results are in good agreement with the calculated delithiation voltage of ∼3 V. Note that the width of the EW is not directly related to the band gap of a material and is mainly affected by the chemical potential of Li ions in this material. In general, a material containing fewer Li ions has a higher EW, which could be reflected in LiGe2(PO4)3 and LiZr2(PO4)3. Since the decomposition products could serve as a good interfacial passivation layer, which hinders further decomposition of the solid electrolyte, the actual working EW of LixM2(PO4)3 might be wider and higher than the computed one.

(b) Electrochemical windows (purple rectangle) and band gaps (black line) of LixM2(PO4)3 solid electrolytes. Short dashed lines represent the highest voltage of full delithiation.
The diffusion coefficient (D) of Li ions could be estimated from MSD (mean-squared displacement) plots, and then based on the Nernst–Einstein relationship, we could extract the Li ion conductivity at different temperatures. From the fitted line of ln(σT) ∼ 1000/T, the Li ion conductivity of LixM2(PO4)3 at room temperature (300 K) could be extrapolated. The results are summarized in Fig. 5. In general, materials containing more Li (Li3M2(PO4)3) exhibit higher ionic conductivity than those with a smaller amount of Li (LiM2(PO4)3). However, more Li ions lead to a lower oxidation potential in the EW. Thus, in practice there would be some balance between the EW and the ionic conductivity. Besides, it could be observed from Fig. 5 that the structures with space group P21/n show better ionic conductivity than those with rhombohedral symmetry (Ge, In, and Mo). Although the thermal stability of Li3Bi2(PO4)3 and Li3Sb2(PO4)3 is not satisfactory, they possess rather high ionic conductivity at room temperature. If some modification methods, such as partial substitution of Bi or Sb with other transition metals, are used to improve the stability of these two materials, they would become promising solid electrolytes. Our simulated conductivities agree well with the results from experiments in orders of magnitude and are illustrated in Table 2.
