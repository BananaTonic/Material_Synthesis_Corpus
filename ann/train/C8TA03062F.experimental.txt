Trimethylolpropane (Acros Organics, 99%), α-bromoisobutyryl bromide (98%), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, ≥97.0%, GC), lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (LiTFSI, CF3SO2NLi–SO2CF3, battery grade), LiPF6 (battery grade), copper(i) bromide (CuBr, 98%), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA, Mn = 500), 1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyl triethylene tetramine (HMTETA), bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BPDE) and poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol) bis(2-aminopropyl ether) (ED2003, average Mn ∼ 2000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. All the solvents were anhydrous and used without further treatment.
2.2Synthesis of copolymer 3PPEG-co-GMA-x by ATRP
The synthesis of 3-armed poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer (3PPEG-co-GMA-x) is shown in Scheme 1. In a typical polymerization, a macro-initiator prepared according to a previous procedure,47 trimethylolpropane tri(2-bromo isobutyrate) (TMPBr3, 0.14 g, 0.72 mmol equiv. Br), PEGMA (18.0 g, 36 mmol), GMA (1.02 g, 7.2 mmol), ligand HMTETA (165 mg, 0.72 mmol), CuBr (103 mg, 0.72 mmol), and anhydrous toluene (10 mL) were charged into a Schlenk flask under nitrogen. The solution was degassed three times with a freeze–pump–thaw cycle. The flask was immersed in an oil bath preheated at 85 °C, and after 4 h it was quenched in liquid nitrogen. The solution was diluted with THF and passed through a column of neutral alumina to remove the copper salts. The product was precipitated twice with an excess of ether, filtered, and vacuum dried at 45 °C to obtain a colloidal product. 1H NMR (δppm, CDCl3): 4.07 (s, 6H), 3.97 (d, 2H), 3.66 (m, –OCH2CH2O–), 3.27 (d, 2H), 2.82 (s, 1H, cyclic ether), 2.63 (s, 1H, cyclic ether), 1.59 (s, –CH3), 0.94 (d, 2H), 0.86 (s, 3H). A series of star polymers, 3PPEG-co-GMA-x (x is the feed ratio of GMA by molar mass), were prepared by fixing the amount of PEGMA but varying the amount of GMA. The details of the feeding ratio are shown in Table 1.

A one-pot synthesis strategy based on a ring-opening polymerization reaction was used to prepare all-solid-state polymer membranes. 3PPEG-co-GMA-x, with varying amounts of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BPDE) and ED2003, and a calculated amount of LiTFSI were successively added to the CH3CN solution and the precursor solution was stirred at 25 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, the precursor solution was cast on a polytetrafluorethylene coated dish and heated at 80 °C for 24 h to ensure that all the epoxy groups were reacted. After that, it was further dried under high vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. The thickness of the obtained membrane is around 150 μm.
2.4Characterization
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was performed on a PerkinElmer FT-IR Spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The 1H NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker spectrometer (400 MHz) by using deuterated chloroform as the internal reference. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), the so-called size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis, was conducted with a Breeze Waters system equipped with a Rheodyne injector, a 1515 Isocratic pump and a Waters 2414 differential refractometer using polystyrenes as the standard and tetrahydrofuran as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 and 40 °C through a Styragel column set, Styragel HT3 and HT4 (19 mm × 300 mm, 103 + 104 Å) to separate molecular weight (MW) ranging from 102 to 106. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5005 diffraction meter with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The surface image of the membranes was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM, FEI Quanta 200), and the composite films were gold-sprayed prior to the measurements. Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements were performed using a TA DSC Q2000 differential scanning calorimeter. The samples were sealed in Al pans inside a glovebox. The samples were measured under a continuous nitrogen purge of 50 mL min−1. The samples were cooled from room temperature to −90 °C, equilibrated, and then heated to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1; then they were cooled to −90 °C again, equilibrated and finally heated to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Thermogravimetric (TGA) measurements were carried out on a TA 2950 thermogravimetric analyzer under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL min−1. The samples were isothermally held at 50 °C for 30 min, and then heated to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
The dynamic moduli and stress–strain properties of the polymer membranes were measured on a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA Q800). The polymer membrane was cut into a rectangular shape (4.0 mm × 3.0 mm) for dynamical mechanical analysis. Storage and loss moduli were measured with a tension clamp utilizing a single frequency at a fixed strain of 0.01 N. Dynamic moduli tests were conducted from −100 °C to 100 °C at a heating rate of 3 K min−1. Stress–strain analysis was conducted under controlled force mode at 25 °C with a force ramp rate of 0.2 N min−1.
2.5Electrochemical measurements
Alternating current (AC) impedance measurement was carried out using a Swagelok cell on a Bio-Logic VSP instrument over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 mHz with a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV. The samples are equilibrated at each temperature for at least 90 min before measurement. The ionic conductivity (σ) of the polymer electrolytes was calculated according to the following equation:1where R is the bulk electrolyte resistance, and L and S are the thickness and area of the polymer electrolyte film, respectively. The real part of the dielectric constant was calculated by using the following equation:2where Cp is the capacitance of the sample, ε0 (dielectric permittivity in vacuum) is equal to 8.85 × 10 −12 F m−1, S is the effective surface area, and L is the thickness of the samples.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out using a Pt‖polymer electrolyte‖Li Swagelok cell from 2.0 to 6 V vs. Li/Li+ at 60 °C with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The lithium transference number (t+) was determined by using a combination method of dc polarization and ac impedance measurements.48 The sample was sandwiched between two 0.5 mm-thick lithium foils as non-blocking electrodes in an argon gas-filled glove box. The dc voltage pulse applied to the cell was 10 mV. It can be obtained according to the following equation:3where ΔV is the potential applied across the cell, I0 and Is are the initial current and steady-state current, and R0 and Rs are the charge transfer resistance before and after the polarization.
To test the stability of the polymer electrolytes against lithium metal, symmetric Li‖Li cells were assembled and cycled under a sequence of 3 h charge at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2, 1 h rest, 3 h discharge at a current density of −0.2 mA cm−2 and 1 h rest. LiFePO4 electrodes were prepared by first homogeneously mixing LiFePO4 powder and C45 in a LiTFSI/PEO (Mw, 1 000 000) (Li/EO = 1/10) solution in acetonitrile with an active material weight ratio of 5 : 1 : 4, and then coated onto aluminum foil and dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The loading of the active material was about 1.0 mg cm−2. Coin cells with lithium foil as the anode and LiFePO4 as the cathode were assembled inside an argon-filled glove box with a moisture level &lt;1 ppm. The cycling performance of the polymer electrolytes was evaluated on an Arbin BT2000 instrument over the voltage range of 2.5–4.0 V at 60 °C.
