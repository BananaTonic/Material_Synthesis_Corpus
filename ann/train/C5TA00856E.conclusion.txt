Conclusions
In conclusion, SiO2–PEI–PU membranes have been successfully constructed via an electrospinning technique, which has been shown to possess superior ionic conductivity and excellent safety for use in high power LIBs. Owing to the introduction of SiO2 NPs, high porosity and electrolyte uptake, the SiO2–PEI–PU membranes were endowed with a superior ionic conductivity of 6.25 mS cm−1, a high anodic stability up to 4.86 V, uniform pore size distribution and improved thermostability displaying 2% dimensional change after exposure to 170 °C for 0.5 h. Notably, the Li/LiFePO4 (high mass loading LiFePO4 electrode of 8 mg cm−2) coin cells based on the as-prepared SiO2–PEI–PU membranes exhibit higher cyclability and better rate capability compared with the Celgard membrane based cell not only at room temperature but also at elevated temperature, indicating that the SiO2–PEI–PU membranes are potential separator candidates for high power LIBs. The results in this work encourage us to continue the study on high-performance LIBs with the aim of achieving high cyclability and rate capability by applying electrospun nanofibrous membranes as separators.
