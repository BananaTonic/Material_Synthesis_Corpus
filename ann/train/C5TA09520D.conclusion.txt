Conclusions
We fabricated low temperature processable ZnO electron conductor based MAPbI3 perovskite hybrid solar cells with 17.6% average power conversion efficiency. The conductivity of TiO2 and ZnO electron conductors was 0.00006 mS cm−1 and 0.0031 mS cm−1, respectively. Although the Dn values of both devices are almost the same, the τn of the ZnO electron conductor based device was increased to 1.2-fold than that of the TiO2 electron conductor based device. Due to the better electron conductivity of ZnO than TiO2, the electron extraction from MAPbI3 to electron conductors was improved in the ZnO electron conductor based device and τn was also increased by the reduced backward recombination. Therefore, the ZnO electron conductor based device exhibited better η and less J–V hysteresis with respect to the scan direction and scan rate compared to the TiO2 electron conductor based device. Considering the low temperature processability of the ZnO electron conductor we also fabricated the flexible device. The ZnO electron conductor based flexible devices fabricated on the PEN/ITO substrate achieved the 15.5% average power conversion efficiency with considerable mechanical stability.
