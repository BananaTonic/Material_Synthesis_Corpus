Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) nanoparticles with high-density molecular brushes (MB-LLZTO) and introduced them into poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) to form a high ionic conductivity composite electrolyte. The combination of MB-LLZTO and PEO offers an alteration of the lithium ion diffusion pathway in the composite polymer electrolyte. The obtained polymer electrolytes exhibit high ionic conductivities and all-solid-state lithium metal batteries with superior electrochemical performance are assembled. The POM results prove the reduction of crystallinity of the polymer by the coordination of the functional groups at MB-LLZTO with the PEO matrix. Moreover, the introduction of anions into the functional groups could reduce the interactions between the polymer and Li+, which promotes the diffusion of ions effectively. In addition, the Li+ diffusion pathway in the PEO matrix could be altered and enlarged by organic chains through the surface Li+ domain diffusion effect. These factors endow the MB-LLZTO-CPE with excellent electrochemical performance with a high ionic conductivity of 3.11 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 45 °C. By high-resolution 6,7Li solid-state NMR, we provide the experimental evidence for the enhancement of ionic conductivity and the proposed mechanism that Li+ tends to pass through the surface on the MB-LLZTO instead of the LLZTO ceramic. Consequently, the all-solid-state lithium–sulfur battery with MB-LLZTO shows a discharge capacity of approximately 1280 mA h g−1 at low temperature, and stable cycling performance (752 mA h g−1 after 220 cycles). Verification of the Li+ diffusion pathway in the MB-LLZTO based electrolyte may be an effective way to unlock more potential solid polymer electrolytes.
