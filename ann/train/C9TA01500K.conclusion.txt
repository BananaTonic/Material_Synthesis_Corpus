3.Conclusions
In this work, the quick ion conductor La0.56Li0.33TiO3 (LLTO) was firstly used as an absorbent for polysulfides, due to its charged characteristics, and as a catalyst for the polysulfide conversion reaction, due to its structural characteristics, in a LSB. La0.56Li0.33TiO3 can apparently promote the electrochemical conversion of LPS and accelerate the dynamic dissolution of LPS, and consequently reduce the voltage hysteresis and overpotential. Thus, it can significantly improve the reversible capacity and ensure a stable long-term cycle life of LSB even with a lean electrolyte. In particular, the LSB cell using the LLTO-10/CNT/S cathode yields a high reversible capacity of 721 mA h g−1 at 0.8 mA cm−2 with a low E/S of 5 μLE mgS−1 after 50 cycles. When the cathode was incorporated into a LSB with a high sulfur areal loading of 6.4 mg cm−2, which is close to that used in practical conditions, excellent cycling stability and high areal capacity (4.3 mA h cm−2) were obtained. The present research provides a novel approach for incorporating a quick-ionic conductor into a LSB, which can effectively speed up the kinetics of the electrochemical conversion of LPS, aid the rapid dissolution of sulfur-based molecules and regulate the homogenous deposition of Li2S. Therefore, the addition of LLTO can greatly improve the electrochemical performance of LSB, especially under lean electrolyte conditions.
