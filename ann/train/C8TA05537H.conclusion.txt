4.Conclusion
Novel highly conductive solution-derived Na+ superionic conductors, the glass-ceramics xNaI·(1 − x)Na3SbS4 (0.74 mS cm−1 for x = 0.1, at 30 °C), were prepared from homogeneous MeOH solutions, and applied onto the surfaces of active materials (FeS2) to provide Na+-superionically conductive coating layers for ASNBs. Analysis using the complementary methods of XRD, HRTEM, 23Na NMR spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, EXAFS, XPS, DFT calculations, and electrochemical measurements indicates the selective distribution of I at the nanoscale in the disordered domains around the Na3SbS4 crystallites, which promotes facile Na+ transport. These results highlight the importance of microstructures in superionic conducting materials, which cannot be produced using conventional synthesis protocols. Specifically, it is suggested that the overall ionic conductivities can be improved by engineering the grain boundary regions, an aspect which might be overlooked. Finally, a dramatic improvement in the electrochemical performance of FeS2/Na3Sn ASNBs using solution-derived 0.1NaI·0.9Na3SbS4 coatings on FeS2 compared to cells prepared by conventional manual mixing was demonstrated. We believe that these results will provide new insights for the design and synthesis of Na+ superionic conductors and contribute to the development of practical ASNBs.
