4.Conclusions
We have developed a novel exciting strategy to prepare n-type single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and fabricated flexible modules with a multilayered stacked structure with excellent thermoelectric performance. By diethylenetriamine (DETA) doping and subsequent CaH2 treatment, the pristine SWCNTs (p-type) can be effectively converted to possess n-type conducting behavior. The Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity for the DETA-CaH2-SWCNT are −41.0 ± 1.5 μV K−1 and 165 ± 10 S cm−1, respectively. A possible mechanism is proposed to explain the conversion from p-type to n-type conduction. Then, a multilayered alternating stacked structure is employed to achieve high-performance thermoelectric modules, which can realize conduction electrically in series and thermally in parallel. Finally, the thermoelectric module containing 14 couples displays large open circuit voltages of 62 mV and 125 mV at 55 K and 110 K temperature gradients, respectively, and a maximum output power of 649 nW at a temperature difference of 55 K. These promising thermoelectric performances are among the best in organic thermoelectric modules so far. The strategy proposed here opens a new avenue to achieve organic n-type materials and flexible devices with excellent thermoelectric properties. These results will benefit the research of organic thermoelectric materials and speed up the applications of flexible and wearable power-conversion devices.
