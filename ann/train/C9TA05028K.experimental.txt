2.1Materials
Lithium bis(trifluromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Aladdin), hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (HCCP, 98%, Aladdin), 4-acetamidophenol (98%, Aladdin), polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA, Mn = 600, 98%, Aladdin), and polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PEGDE500, Mn = 500, 98%, Aladdin) were used as received. Polyethylene glycol diol (Mn = 1000, 2000, or 4000) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) and acetone were distilled under reduced pressure prior to use. Epichlorohydrin, methanol, potassium carbonate benzophenone, and all other chemicals were purchased from Tianjin Chemical Reagent Factory (China) and used as received.
2.2Synthesis of hexa(4-acetylphenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene (HAcCP)
HAcCP was synthesized according to the reported procedure with slight modification.46 Briefly, preheated HCCP (5.0 g, 14.4 mmol) and 4-acetamidophenol (17.4 g, 115.2 mmol) were dissolved in 200 mL of anhydrous acetone with stirring at room temperature for 15 min under an inert atmosphere. Preheated K2CO3 (29.9 g, 216 mmol) was rapidly added to the solution and the mixture was heated at reflux under vigorous stirring for 4 days under argon atmosphere. After this, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the concentrated solution was poured into excess water. The suspension was filtered and the residue was washed with water three times. A white powder was obtained after drying under vacuum at 50 °C for 2 days (12.5 g, yield: 93%). 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, TMS, ppm): 9.92 (1H, –NH), 6.79–7.45 (4H, dd, Ar–H), 2.04 (3H, –CH3). 13C-NMR (DMSO-d6, TMS, ppm): 168.0 (CO), 144.9 (C–O), 136.4 (C–N), 120.5 (CH), 119.9 (CH), 23.8 (CH3). 31P-NMR (DMSO-d6, ppm): 9.18.
2.3Synthesis of hexa(4-aminophenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene (HAmCP)
HAcCP (25.0 g, 26.6 mmol) was dissolved in 300 mL of methanol. Then, 60 mL of aqueous NaOH solution (57.96 g, 1.449 mol) was slowly added to the solution under an inert atmosphere, and the mixture was refluxed at 70 °C under vigorous stirring for 72 h. After this, the suspension was filtered and washed with excess distilled water three times. The resulting white powder was obtained after drying under vacuum at 50 °C for 2 days (14.6 g, yield: 80%). 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6, TMS, ppm): 6.41–6.52 (4H, dd, Ar–H), 4.91 (2H, Ar–NH2). 13C-NMR (DMSO-d6, TMS, ppm): 145.3 (C–N), 140.5 (C–O), 120.6 (CH), 113.9 (CH). 31P-NMR (DMSO-d6, ppm): 10.67.
2.4Synthesis of polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PEGDE)
PEGDE was synthesized according to the reported procedure with slight modification.47 Epichlorohydrin (2.78 g, 0.03 mol) was added dropwise under vigorous stirring to a mixture of melting polyethylene glycol diol (Mn = 2000) (10.0 g, 0.005 mol), distilled water (0.12 g, 0.12 mL), and pellets of sodium hydroxide (0.12 g, 0.03 mol). Then, the mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 5 h. After this, the mixture was filtered in vacuum and washed with dichloromethane three times (3 × 30 mL). The combined filtrate was dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a solid powder without further purification (8.35 g, yield: 79.0%). The resulting product was denoted as PEGDE2000. 1H-NMR (chloroform-d, TMS, ppm): 3.81–3.78 (m, 2H), 3.63 (s, 226H), 3.43 (s, 2H), 3.16 (s, 2H), 2.79 (s, 2H), 2.60 (s, 2H). PEGDE1000 and PEGDE4000 were prepared by following the same procedure except that different molecular weights of polyethylene glycol diol were used: 5 g and 20 g, respectively.
2.5Preparation of the cyclophosphazene-based hybrid polymer electrolytes
LiTFSI (807.2 mg), 1.5 g of PEGDE4000, and an equivalent molar amount of HAmCP (97.9 mg) were mixed in 6 mL of THF and then subjected to sonication for 15 min to ensure sufficient dissolution. Subsequently, the mixture solution (6 mL) was added to the mold via a pipette and heated for another 12 h after the addition to enable the evaporation of THF and the accomplishment of the amine–epoxy reaction at 100 °C to obtain the CHPE4000 film. CHPE500, CHPE1000, and CHPE2000 were prepared following the same procedure except that different weights of PEGDE were used: 0.188 g, 0.375 g, and 0.750 g, respectively.
2.6Characterization of the polymer electrolytes
The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV400 nuclear magnetic resonance instrument using CDCl3 and d6-DMSO as the solvents and TMS as the internal reference. FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out on an FT interferometer (Bruker Equinox 55) over the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymers was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Q2000) with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from −80 °C to 100 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The thermal stability was investigated by a thermogravimetric analyzer (PerkinElmer 4000) under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 30 °C to 800 °C. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was carried out by EXSTAR with a heating rate of 30 °C min−1 and a frequency of 21 Hz. The test was conducted using the compressed mode; the dimensions were 1 × 1 cm2. The crystal structure of CHPEs and PEGDE was characterized by X-ray diffraction (SmartLab-SESmartLab-SE) using Cu Kα radiation (40 mA/40 kV) over the range of 5–80° with a scanning rate of 5° min−1.
The ionic conductivity of CHPEs was investigated by using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Netherlands) in the temperature range from 30 to 100 °C with an interval of 10 °C. The recorded data were measured over a range from 1 MHz to 10 Hz. The polymer electrolyte films were clamped by two stainless steel electrodes. The membranes were held for 5 min before measurement at the predetermined temperature. The ionic conductivity of the CHPE films was calculated by using the following equation: σ = L/(RbS), in which L (cm) represents the thickness of the polymer electrolyte film, Rb (Ω) is the bulk resistance, and S is the effective contact area of the electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out to investigate the electrochemical stability window of the polymer electrolyte with Li/CHPE/stainless steel. The range of the voltage sweep was from 0 to 6 V. The lithium ion transference number (t+) was measured using an Li/CHPE/Li cell. The cell was polarized at 10 mV (ΔV) and time–current dependence was recorded until the current was steady. The initial current and the steady state current were denoted as I0 and IS, respectively. The impedance of the cell was measured before and after the polarization and denoted as R0 and Rs, respectively. The equation t+ = IS(ΔV − I0R0)/I0(ΔV − IsRs) was utilized to calculate t+.
2.7Flame-retardancy and stretchability test
The specimens were fabricated via pouring the mixture solution of HAmCP, PEGDE, and LiTFSI into a strip mold and curing for 12 h after the evaporation of THF at 100 °C. For comparison, polyethylene glycol diacrylate (Mn = 600) was employed to dissolve benzophenone and casted into a strip mold, and the comparison specimen was obtained after UV irradiation. The two specimens were denoted as CHPE strip and P(PEGDA) strip. The two strips were hanged using pliers to fix the strips. An alcohol lamp was used to ignite the two strips for 3 s and it was then removed to evaluate the flame-retardant ability of the strips.
The stretchability test was conducted using an electronic universal testing apparatus (Shenzhen San Testing Machine Co., CMT4104) with the sample fixed on both the sides and stretched at a speed of 2 mm min−1.
2.8Interfacial stability of the electrolyte/electrodes
The interfacial stability between the polymer electrolyte and the lithium foil was evaluated by an Li/CHPE/Li symmetric cell with a constant current density of 0.1 mA cm−2. The symmetric cells were alternatively charged and discharged for 3 h in turn for each cycle.
2.9Battery fabrication and evaluation
The slurry, consisting of LiFePO4, carbon black, and PVDF in the weight ratio of 8 : 1 : 1, was coated on an aluminum foil, dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight, and used as the cathode material. The CR2032 coin cell batteries were assembled with a sequence of LiFePO4 cathode, CHPE, and Li anode. The charge–discharge cycling performance was studied using a battery apparatus (LANHE CT2001A) with a potential range from 2.5 to 4.2 V at 60 °C.
