3.Conclusions
A series of poly(terphenylene alkylene)s tethered with monocyclic DMP and spirocyclic ASU cations, respectively, were successfully prepared by superacid-mediated polycondensations of terphenyl and trifluoroketone monomers. The synthesis of the piperidine-functionalized m-terphenyl and trifluoroketone monomers allowed a systematic variation of the type and position of the cation and the rigidity of the backbone polymer to study the influence on HEM properties. Although all HEMs showed high alkaline stability, those functionalized with DMP cations showed the most attractive combination of high thermal and alkaline stability, high hydroxide conductivity and restricted water uptake. In particular, the placement of the DMP cation on the pendant phenyl group of the ketone monomer residues instead of on the more rigid backbone terphenyl units resulted in an improvement of both alkaline stability and hydroxide conductivity. Functionalization with the bulky ASU cation gave very high thermal stability, but poor ionic clustering and low conductivity. In addition, the ASU cation showed a lower alkaline stability than the DMP cation when compared on the same backbone and position. This might be explained by a larger degree of bond angle distortion of the former cation when attached to the rigid polymer backbone, which may facilitate degradation. The present study provides important structure–property relationships for the development of alkali-stable HEMs based on diaryl ether-free aromatic polymers carrying N-alicyclic cations having all β-hydrogens placed in 6-membered rings.
