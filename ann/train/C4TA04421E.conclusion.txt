Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel porous luminescent terbium–organic framework (Tb-DSOA) based on a sulfonate–carboxylate ligand. This MOF shows good water stability and can detect Fe3+ with high selectivity over other interfering metal ions by fluorescence turn-off at the centre of Tb ions. This high selectivity for Fe3+ should be related to the potential Lewis basic sites of the sulfonate group and/or aqua ligands on its pores. These hydrophilic sites trapped in hydrogen-bond nets endow Tb-DSOA with proton conduction under humid conditions. Although the conductivity of the targeted complex is not particularly high, it provides a new prototype of robust proton-conducting metal–organic-frameworks assembled by sulfonate–caboxylate ligands. Water adsorption analysis further shows that the continuous H-bond network among the sulfonate groups and water molecules is important for proton transfer in the title compound. Our work illustrates that sulfonate metal–organic frameworks could become multi-functional materials in sensors, gas sorption,8b fuel cells14 and catalysis23 in the future because they possess both the porosity of MOFs and the functionality of sulfonate groups.
