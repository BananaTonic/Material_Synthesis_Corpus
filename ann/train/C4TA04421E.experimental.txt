Materials
All chemicals were of reagent grade quality, and they were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. Na2H2DSOA was prepared following a method described in the literature.16
Synthesis of {[Tb4(OH)4(DSOA)2(H2O)8]·(H2O)8}n (Tb-DSOA)
The complex Tb-DSOA was produced by the reaction of Na2H2DSOA and terbium nitrate (0.3 : 0.4 mmol) in aqueous condition. The above mixture was vigorously stirred and sealed in a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel container, heated at 180 °C for 3 days and then cooled to room temperature. Light yellow coloured single crystals of Tb-DSOA were isolated. Yield, 87% (based on Tb). Anal. Calcd for Tb-DSOA: H 2.66, C 18.47, S 7.04. Found: H 2.61, C17.87, S 7.22.
Physical measurements
Thermal analysis were performed on an SDT 2960 thermogravimetric analyzer from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under air. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was measured at 293 K on a Rigaku D/max-3B diffractometer (Cu-Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å). The IR spectra (Fig. S1 in ESI) were recorded as KBr pellets on a Nicolet NEXUS 470-FTIR spectrometer in the 4000 to 400 cm−1 region. Elemental analyses for C, H, N and S were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 240 elemental analyzer. Luminescent spectra were recorded with a HORIBA FLuoroMax-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP) was performed on a Thermo ICAP 6500 DUO spectrometer. UV-vis spectroscopic studies were collected on a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer. Water adsorption isotherms were volumetrically collected using a BELSORP-max apparatus (BEL Japan). Measurements were performed after the elimination of guests by the evacuation of the sample at 90 °C for over 20 h.
X-ray crystallography
X-ray single-crystal diffraction data were collected on a Bruker SMART1000 CCD diffractometer with Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature. The empirical absorption corrections were applied using the SADABS program.17 The structure was solved with program SHELXS-97 18 and refined with the program SHELXL-97.19 The lattice parameters and structural data are collected in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI.
Experiments of metal ion sensing
The grounded powder samples of Tb-DSOA (30 mg) were immersed in 4 mL of 0.01 M aqueous solutions of 19 metal ions: M(NO3)x (M = Na+, K+, Li+, Ag+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Sn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Al3+, Cr3+, and Fe3+) and FeCl2, at room temperature for one day to form Mn+@Tb-DSOA (metal ion incorporated Tb-DSOA) as microcrystalline solids for luminescence study. Time dependent-luminescence were measured for Fe3+@Tb-DSOA obtained after immersing the Tb-DSOA samples in 0.01 M Fe(NO3)3 aqueous solutions for different times: 5 min, 10 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 10 h, 24 h and three days, respectively. Ion interference measurements: Tb-DSOA were added to aqueous solution containing 1 equiv. of 17 metal ions Mn+ (M = Na+, K+, Li+, Ag+, Mg2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Pb2+, Sn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Al3+ and Cr3+) to form the composite M17n+@Tb-DSOA, as well as aqueous solutions containing 1 equiv. of the above 17 ions and Fe3+ to form (M17n+ + Fe3+)@Tb-DSOA; their luminescence were measured. The quenching effect of the luminescence of Tb-DSOA as a function of Fe3+ concentration was investigated via measuring the luminescence of Fe3+@Tb-DSOA obtained after immersing the Tb-DSOA samples in different concentrations (10−6–10−1 mol L−1) of Fe(NO3)3 aqueous solutions.
Measurements of proton conductivity
Proton conductivity was measured on the powdered crystalline samples Tb-DSOA in tablets under a pressure of 220 MPa. Ac impedance spectroscopy measurement was performed on a PARSTAT 2273 impedance analyzer over a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz, with a quasi-four-probe electrochemical cell and an applied ac voltage of 10 mV with copper electrodes (the purity of Cu was more than 99.9%). The ZSimpWin software was used for the fitting of the impedance profiles by means of an equivalent circuit to obtain the resistance values. The conductivity was calculated as σ = (1/R)(h/S), where R is the resistance, h is the thickness, and S is the area of the tablet. Activation energies (Ea) were calculated by fitting the conductivity data to the Arrhenius relation for thermally activated conduction, which is given as σT = σ0 exp(−Ea/kBT), where σ, σ0, Ea, kB, and T are the conductivity, pre-exponential factor, activation energy, Boltzmann constant and absolute temperature, respectively.
