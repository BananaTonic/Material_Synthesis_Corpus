Conclusions
In summary, PANI/graphene composite films have been prepared by a combination of in situ polymerization and a solution process. The in situ polymerization obviously enhanced the dispersion homogeneity of graphene in the PANI matrix. The better dispersion of graphene not only introduced more nano interfaces into the polymer matrix, but also strengthened the π–π conjugation interactions between PANI and graphene. Consequently, more ordered regions were formed in the PANI/GP-P composite films, leading to the fact that the Seebeck coefficient of the composite films was improved obviously. The optimal electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of PANI/GP-P composite films reached 814 S cm−1 and 26 μV K−1, respectively, resulting in a maximum power factor of 55 μW m−1 K−2, which is the highest value among the reported polymer/graphene composite TE materials.
