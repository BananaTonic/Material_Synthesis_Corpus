Conclusions
In summary, a facile method for the modification of GPEs was proposed to prepare membranes with good wettability and high electrolyte retention ability. Electrospinning affords a membrane with a fibrous structure, while ionic liquid nanoparticles (SiO2PPTFSI) increase the mechanical performance, porosity and electrolyte uptake ability. The NanoIL GPE exhibits an enhanced lithium ion transference number and better compatibility with the lithium electrode. Symmetrical lithium cells with the NanoIL GPE demonstrated excellent plating/stripping cycling stability for about 1260 h without short-circuit. The GPE exhibits a high electrochemical stable potential of 5.1 V facilitated by the IL, thus demonstrating its potential for use with 5 V class LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode materials, with the corresponding cell maintaining a high discharge capacity of 109.6 mA h g−1 after 460 cycles at a rate of 1C. Furthermore, it exhibits a much better rate performance than the other two reference electrolytes (PVDF–HFP GPE and Celgard LE). Accordingly, the NanoIL GPE demonstrates great potential as an efficient electrolyte for application in high voltage lithium metal batteries for use in sustainable energy storage.
