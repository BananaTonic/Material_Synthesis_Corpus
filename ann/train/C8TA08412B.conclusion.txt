Conclusions
Superb Na+ ion conductors have been identified through systematic modelling, leading to theoretical discovery of a double anti-perovskite Na6SOI2 phase, which is electrochemically compatible with sodium anodes.
AIMD simulation shows that moderate off-stoichiometric compositional deviation in the double-anti-perovskite phase leads to significant reduction of the activation barrier for Na+ transportation. This includes moderate enrichment of Na ions together with chalcogen excess and halogen deficiency to maintain charge neutrality. This combined effect results in a very low activation energy of about 0.16 eV for Na25S5O4I7, making it particularly attractive for low temperature application in solid SIBs.
