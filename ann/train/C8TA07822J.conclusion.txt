Conclusions
We synthesized six different porous organic networks (PONs) based either on carbon–hydrogen (PON-1–PON-3) or benzimidazole (PON-4–PON-6) in order to study the influence of network morphology on anhydrous proton conduction. The polymers exhibit high crosslinking degrees as estimated by 13C and 15N MAS NMR spectroscopy. The BET surface areas are between 490 m2 g−1 (PON-3) and 5043 m2 g−1 (PON-1) and they have a high thermal resistance up to 525 °C (PON-2). After post-synthetic incorporation of imidazole via the gas phase, which allowed a maximal filling of 1.1 g g−1 to be reached for PON-1, we investigated the proton conduction performance of these networks as a function of the morphology, chemical functionality, and guest loading. The networks reveal conductivities between 10−7 S cm−1 and 10−4 S cm−1 at 130 °C under anhydrous conditions with maximum values for PON-1 (5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 130 °C). The latter is comparable to state-of-the-art materials like Im@TPB-DMTP-COF15 (4.73 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 130 °C) or TD-PPI16 (3.49 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 90 °C). Moreover, we estimated the activation energy of the polymers to fall in the range of −39 kJ mol−1 to −58 kJ mol−1 and to correlate with the amount of incorporated guest molecules. In this respect, three-dimensional polymers, based on rigid tetrahedral building units seem to be favourable to provide more homogeneous charge carrier distributions. Interestingly, no further influence of pore geometry and degree of pore filling on the conduction performance was found. Furthermore, the presence of polybenzimidazole groups within the polymer backbone (PON-4–PON-6) seemed to have an impeding effect on conduction, especially at low ratios of imidazole to functional groups. This might be due to the stronger binding of imidazole to the functional groups causing its immobilisation. In this respect, further investigations are part of our future work.
