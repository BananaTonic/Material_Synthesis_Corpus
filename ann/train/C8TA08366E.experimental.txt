Experimental
LLZO preparation
Li6.55Al0.15La3Zr2O12 (AL-LLZO) and Li6.55Ga0.15La3Zr2O12 (Ga-LLZO) were prepared via a sol–gel method using the following compounds as starting materials: LiNO3 anhydrous (99.0%, Alfa Aesar), La(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), and Zr(C5H7O2)4 (Alfa Aesar). Al(NO3)3·9H2O (98%, Alfa Aesar) and Ga2O3 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) were employed as dopant precursors. The precursors were weighed in the desired stoichiometry and dissolved in a 9 : 1 mixture of 0.5 M citric acid (ACS reagent, ≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and nitric acid (68%, VWR). After gel formation, combustion was carried out at 600 °C for 12 h with a heating ramp of 2 °C min−1 and a cooling ramp of 10 °C min−1, holding at 100 °C to prevent uptake of water. After milling of the combusted powders in an argon-filled glove box, calcination was carried out in Al2O3 crucibles in a tubular furnace under a dry O2 (BOC high purity grade N6.0) atmosphere at 800 °C for 12 h with a heating ramp of 5 °C min−1 and a cooling ramp of 5 to 10 °C min−1. Pellets of the calcined and milled powders were prepared by using 0.5 g of powder pressed using a circular dye (13 mm diameter) under 2 tons for 1 minute in the glove box. The as prepared pellets were sintered at 1175 °C and 1150 °C for Al- and Ga-doped LLZO respectively in an Ar atmosphere in alumina crucibles. During sintering, the pellets were covered by the mother powder in order to take into account possible lithium losses. After sintering, the pellets were polished using different grit SiC sandpapers (in the sequence of 240 (58 μm), 800 (21 μm), 1200 (15 μm), 2500 (8 μm) and 4000 (5 μm)). The pellets prepared in this way have an average sintered diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 1 mm. In order to reveal the grains, the polished pellets were etched in an Ar atmosphere at 900 °C for 30 minutes with a heating and cooling ramp of 10 ° min−1. During etching the pellets were placed in enclosed alumina crucibles on top of Pt foil. The density of the pellets was geometrically calculated.
Physical characterisation pre- and post-cycling
Polished and etched Al-LLZO and Ga-LLZO pellets were characterised by XRD (using a Bruker D2 Phaser instrument with a 2θ range of 10° to 80° 2θ, with a step size of 0.034° 2θ, and a time per step of 2 s step−1) in order to confirm the transition between tetragonal and cubic phases and in order to define any possible secondary crystalline phase. SEM and EDX images were recorded using a Zeiss electron microscope (Sigma 300, Leo Gemini 1525 field emission gun) with accelerating voltages varying from 5 to 1.5 eV.
Symmetrical cell assembly
Symmetrical Li/LLZO/Li cells were prepared by hot pressing Li metal foils on both sides of polished LLZO pellets in an Ar filled glove box. Lithium foils were cut with a smaller diameter (9.5 mm) than the diameter of the LLZO pellets (10 mm) in order to avoid short-circuit during cell assembly. Each side of the cell was heated at 150 °C for 30 minutes under a constant pressure. After cooling the Li/LLZO/Li pellet was assembled in a commercial 2032 coin cell case using spacers (either 1 mm or 0.5 mm) and a spring in order to secure the sample inside the cell case.
Electrochemical characterisation
Symmetric Li/LLZO/Li cells were electrochemically cycled at room temperature using a commercial battery tester (580 Battery Test System (Alvatek) and BCycle software) at various current densities for 30 minutes for each charging or discharging cycle, with a 5 minutes rest period between charging/discharging cycles, until the cell showed short-circuit. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted in a frequency range between 0.1 Hz and 13 MHz at 100 mV signal amplitude prior to and after electrochemical characterisation using a Solatron 1260 Impedance Analyser. The impedance was measured at room temperature with a 2-contact rig using a HFS600E-P Linkam stage and plotted in Nyquist-type plots with the response fitted to equivalent circuits using Z-view software.
FIB-SIMS
A FEI FIB200-SIMS ion microscope was used for imaging and mapping and recording mass spectra from the surface of the materials, as well as being used in depth profiling mode to obtain chemical information as a function of depth. A Ga+ primary ion source (69Ga 99% isotopically pure) at 30 keV was used as the primary beam (spot size 7–10 nm) which is incident at 30° to the normal of the ceramic surface using a current from 30 pA for imaging and up to 1 nA for depth profiling. Simultaneous negative and positive secondary ions were detected in dynamic SIMS mode using both FEI and Hiden EQS quadrupole detectors, respectively. The FIB-SIMS instrument is equipped with detectors for secondary electrons, positive ions and negative ions to allow an asynchronous semi-simultaneous signal acquisition,29 and for imaging in secondary electron and ion modes.
Transfer of the pre-mounted samples was done by sealing the samples in a container in a glove box, and transferring to the SIMS chamber before immediately pumping down to high vacuum (&lt;10−5 mbar). This meant that the samples for analysis were exposed to ambient air for a matter of no more than a few minutes.
