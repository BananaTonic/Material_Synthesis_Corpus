4.Conclusions
PEDOT:OTf films with very high thermoelectric properties were demonstrated in this work. The as-synthesized PEDOT:OTf films from their precursor solution can exhibit a power factor of 346 ± 39 μW m−1 K−2. The thermoelectric properties are enhanced by a post-polymerization treatment with glucose, ascorbic acid or NaOH. The NaOH treatment gives rise to the highest power factor. The optimal power factor by the NaOH treatment is 568 ± 64 μW m−1 K−2 with a Seebeck coefficient of 49.2 ± 1.4 μV K−1 and an electrical conductivity of 2342 ± 98 S cm−1. The Seebeck coefficient by the NaOH treatment is much higher than that by the glucose or ascorbic acid treatment. The different effects of the three chemicals on the Seebeck coefficient of PEDOT:OTf are attributed to their different dedopings of PEDOT:OTf. The NaOH treatment can dedope PEDOT:OTf by removing the protonic acid doping, whereas the glucose or ascorbic acid treatment can lower the normal oxidation level. Because the charge carriers due to the protonic acid doping have low energy, the dedoping of the protonic acid doping can lead to a more remarkable enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient while it does not significantly lower the electrical conductivity. In addition, these PEDOT:OTf films have excellent stability under ambient conditions. The understanding of the different effects of the base and reducing agents on the dedoping of conductive polymers can provide important guidance for the development of high-performance thermoelectric polymers.
