4.Conclusions
In summary, a self-healing composite polymer electrolyte (SHCPE) has been prepared by blending UPy-functionalized SiO2 in the polymer matrix of PEG–UPy. Compared to the CPE prepared by blending pristine SiO2, the SHCPE exhibits higher ionic conductivity due to the more uniform dispersity of fillers in the polymer matrix benefitting from the supramolecular interactions between SiO2–UPy and the PEG–UPy. More importantly, the self-healing properties of the SHCPE are also improved owing to the increase of activity and physically cross-linking sites in the polymer matrix. The stress–strain testing also demonstrates that the SHCPE increases the yield stress by 110% compared with CPE blended with pristine SiO2. The strong supramolecular networks in the polymer matrix and the adhesion due to the hydrogen bonding endow the SHCPE with excellent compatibility with Li metal. Owing to these outstanding properties, the lithium battery fabricated using the SHCPE as the electrolyte exhibits stable cycling performance. The enhanced self-healing and electrochemical properties demonstrate that the CPE with UPy-functionalized SiO2 is efficient to fabricate safer and high-performance LIBs.
