4.Conclusions
In summary, we have exploited a scalable, compressible yet mechanically robust single-phase mixed ionic–electronic conductor (MIEC) based on a phosphorylated graphene monolith through a facile hydrothermal approach. The synergistic manipulation of the chemical composition and topological structure endows the monolith with high mixed proton/electron conductivity. At 98% RH and 35 °C, an ideal combination of proton conductivity (0.13 S cm−1) and electron conductivity (0. 265 S cm−1) is achieved, outperforming all graphene-based MIECs ever reported. Moreover, the PGM-1-12 possesses robust structural stability and can bear constant compressive strains (40% and 60%) for 100 cycles without obvious conducting performance degradation. The phosphorylated graphene monolith combines high mixed conductivities, mechanical robustness and stable conductive performance under compression, which may find applications in flexible energy conversion and storage devices. It also provides a novel concept for the fabrication of high performance mixed conductors by implanting long-range ordered channels enabled by 2D materials.
