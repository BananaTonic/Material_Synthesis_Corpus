Materials
PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions (PH1000) were bought from Heraeus Ltd. with a PEDOT:PSS concentration of 1.3 wt% by weight dispersed in H2O. 1-Hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C16MIm]PF6) and 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C16MIm]BF4) were bought from Energy Chemical and the center for green chemistry, LICP, CAS, respectively. P3HT (4200E) was bought from Rieke Metals Inc., and PC61BM (99.5%) was bought from American Dye Source, Inc. PTB7 and PC71BM were purchased from 1-material Chemscitech Inc. (St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada) and Solarmer Energy Inc., respectively. All purchased materials were used as received.
Preparation characterization of PH1000 and PH1000/LCIL films
Glass substrates of area 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 were successively cleaned in acetone, detergent water, and deionized water for 15 min each followed by isopropyl alcohol ultrasonic agitation and then dried in N2. PH1000 filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s on a glass, which was treated with UV for 20 minutes prior to spin coating. The obtained films (thickness ∼ 80 nm) were annealed on a hot plate in ambient atmosphere at 120 °C for 20 min. Using spin-coated LCIL DMF solution (1.75 mg mL−1) on the dried PH1000 films at 2000 rpm for 60 afforded the PH1000/LCIL films. Then, the modified films were annealed on a hot plate in ambient atmosphere at 120 °C for 25 min. The PH1000/[C16MIm]PF6 films had a thickness of about 70 nm, and the PH1000/[C16MIm]BF4 films a thickness of about 60 nm. The thickness of [C16MIm]PF6 layer and [C16MIm]BF4 is about 20 nm and 10 nm, respectively.
Fabrication of PSCs
PSCs devices were fabricated using PH1000 and PH1000/LCIL films as the transparent anodes on glass, and P3HT:PC61BM, PTB7:PC71BM were chosen as active layers for comparison. The P3HT : PC61BM (1 : 1 by weight) active blend layer with a thickness of 100 nm was prepared by spin-coating the dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution at 800 rpm for 30 s and then 1400 rpm for 2 s. The devices are annealed at 150 °C for 10 min on a hotplate in a glove box. The PTB7 : PC71BM (1 : 1.5 by weight) active blend layer was prepared by spin-coating mixed solvent of chlorobenzene-1,8-diiodoctane (97 : 3 by volume) solution at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The cathode interlayer material poly [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)](PFN) was dissolved in methanol under the presence of a small amount of acetic acid of 0.1 mg mL−1 and was spin-coated onto the top of the obtained active layer at 5000 rpm for 60 s to form a thin interlayer. Then, 100 nm Al was evaporated through a shadow mask under 10−5.
