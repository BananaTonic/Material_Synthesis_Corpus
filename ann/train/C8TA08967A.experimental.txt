Thionyl chloride (AR grade, 98.0%), trifluoromethylsulfonamide (TFSI-NH2, AR grade, 99.0%), 1,2-dichloromethane (DCE, anhydrous, 99.9%), triethylamine (AR grade, 98.0%), dimethylformamide (DMF, AR grade, 99.0%), methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP, AR grade, 99.0%), propylene carbonate (PC, AR grade, 99.9%), dimethylaminopyridine (AR grade, 99.5%), poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMMA, average molecular weight = 300), poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PEGDA, average molecular weight = 575), 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN, recrystallised, 99.99%) and ethanol (EtOH, AR grade, 99.5%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Reagent Co., Ltd, China. Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, AR grade, aqueous solution, 98.2%) and diethyl ether (AR grade, 99.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. The stabilisers in PEGMMA and PEGDA were removed by column chromatography before use; other reagents were used as received.
2.2Chlorosulfonylation of PEEK
The chlorosulfonylation of PEEK involved two steps, as shown in Scheme 1 and 2.54–56 PEEK (27 g) was dissolved in concentrated H2SO4 (500 mL) under vigorous stirring at −10 °C for 4 h. The temperature was raised to 55 °C and then held constant for 8 h (Scheme 2). The obtained orange solution was poured into abundant iced water to precipitate white fibres, which were sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK). SPEEK was immersed in water for 5 days to remove the residual H2SO4, during which time the water was refreshed daily. The degree of functionalisation determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was 86.86% (Fig. S1).

SPEEK (10 g) was immersed in thionyl chloride (150 mL). DMF (0.75 mL) was slowly added dropwise. After the SPEEK was fully dissolved, the reaction mixture was kept at 80 °C for 5 h (Scheme 3). Finally, the yellow solution was poured into diethyl ether (500 mL) to form a precipitate of off-white blocks, which was chlorosulfonylated poly(ether ether ketone) (ClSPEEK). ClSPEEK was immersed in diethyl ether for 3 days to remove the residual thionyl chloride, during which time the diethyl ether was refreshed every 12 h. The final product was dried at 80 °C under vacuum and then stored in a desiccator.

2.3Grafting of [1-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide]sulfonyl groups
[1-(Trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide]sulfonyl groups were grafted onto PEEK using the method described in a previous study.56 Typically, TFSI-NH2 (2.982 g), trimethylamine (8.357 mL) and dimethylaminopyridine (0.4367 g) were dissolved in anhydrous DCE (35.0 mL). ClSPEEK (7.169 g) was dissolved in DCE (30.0 mL) These two solutions were cooled to −25 °C and then slowly mixed by magnetic stirring. A lot of off-white precipitate was generated during mixing. The reaction system was sealed and then stirred at 25 °C for 36 h to redissolve the precipitate. The final mixture was purified by centrifugation at 7990 rpm for 1 h to obtain a clarified golden solution, which was washed four times with 1 M hydrochloric acid (100 mL), evaporated by rotary evaporation and then dried at 80 °C under vacuum to obtain an amber-like solid, which was PEEK modified with [1-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide]sulfonyl groups (denoted as TFSISPEEK). The reaction formula is shown in Scheme 4.

2.4Lithiation of TFSISPEEK
TFSISPEEK (9.000 g) was dissolved in DMF (90 mL) to form a homogeneous solution. LiH (0.900 g) was slowly added and then the resulting mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 12 h. The excess LiH was removed by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was evaporated by a rotary evaporator and then dried at 60 °C under vacuum to obtain an amber-like solid (LiTSPEEK). The crude LiTSPEEK was loaded in a dialysis bag (molecular weight cut-off = 2000) and then stirred in abundant deionised water at 70 °C for 48 h to remove impurities. The reaction formula is shown in Scheme 5.

2.5Fabrication of an LiTSPEEK membrane
LiTSPEEK (1.000 g), PEGMMA (0.7500 g), PEGDA (0.075 g) and AIBN (0.025 g) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (5.0 mL) and PC (10.0 mL) to form a casting solution. The casting solution was poured onto a glass plate and then dried at 70 °C for 60 h to remove the solvent and obtain a membrane, which is designated as the LiTSPEEK/P(PEGMMA) membrane. PEGMMA and PEGDA polymerised in situ to form a crosslinked branched macromolecule, as shown in Scheme 6, and proved by Fig. S2. An LiTSPEEK membrane was prepared as a reference sample by omitting PEGMMA and PEGDA from the casting solution. To obtain a gel electrolyte membrane, an LiTSPEEK/P(PEGMMA) membrane (1.000 g) was immersed in PC (0.250 g) for 24 h to ensure that the PC was fully absorbed by the membrane. The obtained gel electrolyte membrane is designated as the LiTSPEEK/P(PEGMMA)/PC membrane.

2.6Characterisations
NMR spectroscopies, including 3Li, 19F, 13C and 1H, were conducted using a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Inova600, Varian Ltd., USA). Samples were dissolved in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) to form 2.5 wt% solutions before measurements.
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted using a VERTEX 70v instrument produced by OPUS OPTICS, Germany. Membrane samples were tested at the wave number range of 4000–400 cm−1 and scan rate of 4 cm−1 s−1.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; S-4800, Hitachi Ltd., Japan) was used to probe the morphologies of the membranes. To observe cross sections of membranes, samples were freeze-fractured in liquid nitrogen.
Phase separation structures of membranes were detected by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). LiTSPEEK was immersed in 1.0 M aqueous AgNO3 at 60 °C for 36 h to replace the Li+ with silver ions (Ag+) to stain the TFSI anion groups; the stained polymer is designated as AgTSPEEK. AgTSPEEK was purified by dialysis in water to remove the residual AgNO3. Then, AgTSPEEK was dissolved in NMP (10 wt%) and insoluble substances were removed by centrifugation. An AgTSPEEK/P(PEGMMA) membrane was fabricated following the preparation method of the LiTSPEEK/P(PEGMMA) membrane described in Section 2.5. The obtained AgTSPEEK/P(PEGMMA) membrane was embedded in epoxy resin, frozen in liquid nitrogen, cut to form slices with thicknesses of 70 nm and then a slice was loaded on a copper grid. The operating voltage, current and vacuum background pressure of the HRTEM instrument (2010F, JEOL Ltd., Japan) were 200 kV, 100 μA and 1.4 × 10−6 Pa, respectively.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the Tg values of membranes. A Netzsch 204 F1 calorimeter with liquid nitrogen as a cold source was employed. The LiTSPEEK membrane was preheated from room temperature to 180 °C, cooled to −90 °C and then reheated to 200 °C. The LiTSPEEK/P(PEGMMA)/PC membrane was preheated from room temperature to 50 °C, cooled to −150 °C and then reheated to 100 °C. The LiTSPEEK/P(PEGMMA) membrane was preheated from room temperature to 100 °C, cooled to −90 °C and then reheated to 150 °C. The heating rate was 10 °C min−1 and the cooling rate was 5 °C min−1.
2.7Ionic conductivity measurements
The ionic conductivities of membranes were tested by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a Princeton® PASTAT 2273 electrochemical workstation. A membrane sample was sandwiched between two stainless-steel electrodes and then assembled into a 2032-type battery shell. The sample was heated in an oven to a series of certain temperatures (25–90 °C, interval of 10 °C). The EIS of the sample was measured in the frequency range from 1.0 MHz to 10 Hz and the disturbance voltage was 5.0 mV. The ionic conductivity (σ, S cm−1) was calculated using eqn (1):1where d (cm) is the membrane thickness, A (cm2) is the area of the electrodes and R (Ω) is the resistance obtained from the EIS data.
2.8Transference number measurement
A membrane sample was sandwiched between two lithium electrodes and then assembled into a 2032-type battery shell. First, EIS data for the initial state were collected in the frequency range from 65 kHz to 1 Hz under open-circuit conditions to obtain the initial resistance (Ri, Ω) of passivation layers.57 The sample was then subjected to a 10 mV polarisation bias (ΔV, mV) and the induced initial current (I0, mA) was measured. The sample was kept at 10 mV for 3.5 h and then the final current (Is, mA) was measured. EIS data for the final state were collected to obtain the final resistance (Rs, Ω) of passivation layers. With these values, tLi+ was calculated using eqn (2):2
2.9Electrochemical stability window
The electrochemical stability windows of membranes were tested by linear cyclic voltammetry using the Princeton® PASTAT 2273 electrochemical workstation. Each membrane sample was sandwiched between a stainless-steel electrode (as the working electrode) and lithium electrode (as counter and reference electrodes) and then assembled into a 2032-type battery shell. Potential scans were conducted in the range from 0 to 6 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a constant rate of 1.0 mV s−1.
2.10Coin battery assembly and testing
LiTSPEEK (1.000 g), PEGMMA (0.750 g), PEGDA (0.075 g) and AIBN (0.025 g) were dissolved in NMP (40.00 mL) at 60 °C for 12 h. LiFePO3 (7.000 g) and acetylene black (1.000 g) were added. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h to form a homogeneous slurry. The slurry was coated on the surface of aluminium foil (thickness: 15 μm) using a coating machine. The obtained electrode was dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 24 h. The electrode was processed to form discs with a diameter of 12 mm using a hole punch.
A coin battery was assembled using a 2032-type battery shell as follows. An electrode disc, membrane sample, lithium metal, stainless-steel gasket and leaf spring were placed into a 2032-type battery shell in sequence. The coin battery was sealed under 3.10 MPa (450 psi). The rate performance of the battery was tested using a Wuhan Land® tester at different temperatures and different C rates between 2.5 and 4.0 V.
