Experimental
Synthesis of MCM-41 nanoparticles
Firstly, 0.94 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was dissolved in 480 mL deionized water. Then 3.5 mL NaOH aqueous solution (2.0 mol L−1) was added to the CTAB solution. 5.5 mL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added dropwise to the CTAB solution. The reaction mixture was subsequently stirred at 70 °C for 3 h to give rise to white precipitates. The precipitated product was filtered, washed with deionized water and methanol, and dried at 80 °C for 2 days. The dry precipitates (1.4 g) were refluxed in a mixed solution of 120 mL 1,4-dioxane, 34 mL deionized water and 8 mL concentrated HCl at 105 °C for one day. The product was filtered, washed with deionized water and methanol, and dried at 80 °C for 2 days to obtain the ordered mesoporous silica, MCM-41 nanoparticles. The MCM-41 nanoparticles were activated at 150 °C in a vacuum and stored in an Ar glovebox for further use.
Preparation of Li-IL@MCM-41 and a solid-state composite cathode
287 mg (1 mmol) bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) was dissolved in 2 mL N-butyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (Pyr14TFSI) obtaining a Li+ containing ionic liquid (Li-IL). Different amounts of Li-IL were added to the MCM-41 nanoparticles, milled into homogeneous mixtures in an Ar glovebox and heated at 150 °C in a vacuum for 4 hours to obtain the “free-flowing” Li-IL@MCM-41 SSE powder.
Different types of commercial electroactive materials (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, Shenzhen Optimumnano Energy Co., Ltd, China; LiCoO2, Tianjin B&amp;M Science and Technology Joint-Stock Co., Ltd, China; LiFePO4, Shenzhen Dynanonic Co., Ltd, China), Li-IL@MCM-41 and acetylene black were milled into homogeneous mixtures respectively in an Ar glovebox in a mass ratio of 5 : 5 : 2 to obtain the solid-state composite cathode powder.
Characterization
The morphological and elemental mapping studies were performed by FEITecnaiG230 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ZEISS Supra 55 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an Oxford AZtec energy dispersive spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded by using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.541 Å) from 1 to 15°. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 tool. The surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model and a density functional theory (DFT) model based on the nitrogen adsorption data derived pore size distribution. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC STAR system at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 flow. The cyclic voltammetry (CV, 0.2 mV s−1), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV, 0.2 mV s−1) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS, 1–106 Hz) data were collected on a CHI600E electrochemical workstation. The Li plating/stripping cycles, battery rate performance and battery cycling behaviour were investigated with a NEWARE battery cycler. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the Li metal surface were acquired on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250X surface analysis system with a monochromatized Al anode X-ray source, and an argon ion beam (accelerating voltage 3 kV) was employed to perform depth profiling (etching area, 1 × 1 mm2). An argon atmosphere controlled glove bag was employed to transfer the sample from the glove box to the XPS system.
Electrochemical measurements
In an Ar glovebox, 60 mg Li-IL@MCM-41 was pressed into a 12 mm pellet under 8 t force and assembled into CR2025 coin cells for the ionic conductivity (SS|Li-IL@MCM-41|SS), electrochemical window (SS|Li-IL@MCM-41|Li), Li transference number (Li|Li-IL@MCM-41|Li) and Li plating/stripping (Li|Li-IL@MCM-41|Li) tests. The Li transference number test for the pristine Li-IL was similar, but a Whatman glass fibre filter was used as the separator. For battery assembly, 2.2 mg composite cathode powder was added into a 7 mm mould and pressed into a pellet under 1 t force. The cathode pellet was then put in the centre of a 12 mm mould and 45 mg Li-IL@MCM-41 was added subsequently, which were further pressed into a 12 mm bilayer pellet under 8 t force. Solid-state batteries (Scheme 1) were assembled and tested in CR2025 coin cells using Li foil (about 1 mm thick) as the anode and the bilayer pellet as the cathode and electrolyte.
