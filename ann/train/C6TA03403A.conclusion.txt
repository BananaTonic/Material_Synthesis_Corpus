5.Conclusions
The electrical conductivity of Sb-substituted lanthanum orthoniobate as a function of temperature and oxygen and water vapour partial pressure has been characterised by impedance spectroscopy. Influence of H/D isotope exchange on the material's conductivity has been analysed by means of classical and semi-classical models. The variation of electrical properties with external conditions has been discussed with bases in a point-defect model, where oxygen vacancies and protonic defects were assumed to be dominant in terms of concentration.
The conductivities of the grain interior and specific grain boundaries have been determined and their influence on the total conductivity has been discussed. Oxygen self-diffusivity in the LNSO30 samples at 800 °C and 900 °C at 210 mbar pressure was measured by means of 18O tracer isotopic exchange. A possible fast grain boundary diffusion pathway has been identified. However overall the oxygen ions seem to contribute little to the total conduction, indicating predominant p-type/protonic contributions under these conditions.
Sb-substituted lanthanum orthoniobate is a material with dominating protonic conductivity at temperatures up to 800 °C in oxidizing atmospheres under wet conditions. The maximum observed protonic conductivity reaches values of ∼10−4 S cm−1 at 800 °C in air with pH2O = 0.035 bar. Under dry conditions, an increasing influence of oxygen vacancies and holes is observed. It has been shown that Sb-substituted lanthanum orthoniobate can be considered as a good potential candidate for high temperature protonic conductors in hydrogen technologies.
