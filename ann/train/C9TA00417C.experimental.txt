Solid electrolyte synthesis
Preparation of multi-doped solid electrolytes
A series of unsubstituted Li7La3Zr2O12 (undoped LLZO), mono-substituted Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (mono-doped LLZTO), dual-substituted Li6.8La2.95Ba0.05Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (dual-doped LLBZTO), and ternary-substituted Li6.65Ga0.05La2.95Ba0.05Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 (ternary-doped LGLBZTO) samples were synthesized through a solid-state reaction. LiOH (98%, Alfa Aesar; preheated at 200 °C for 6 h), La2O3 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich; preheated at 900 °C for 12 h), ZrO2 (99.7%, Alfa Aesar), Al2O3 (1 wt% LLZO, 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich), Ga2O3 (99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), BaCO3 (99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich), and Ta2O5 (99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as reagents. The raw materials were weighed based on stoichiometric quantities with an excess of 10 wt% LiOH to compensate for the possible loss of Li+-vapor components during sintering. The reagents were carefully mixed with isopropyl alcohol and ball milled for 12 h in a Teflon jar by using zirconia balls at 300 rpm for homogenization. The homogeneous slurry was transferred to an alumina crucible and dried at 80 °C overnight to evaporate the solvent. The well-mixed dried powder was ground and then cold pressed into pellets by using a uniaxial press. The resulting pellets were placed in an alumina crucible and heated at 900 °C for 12 h followed by ball milling for another 12 h to obtain the cubic phase. The cubic phase powder was pelletized by both uniaxially cold pressing at 1734 MPa and hot-pressing at 1000 °C and 40 MPa. The calcined cubic phase powder was ground in an agate mortar and then uniaxially pressed into pellets with a diameter of 12 mm and thickness of 2 mm at 1734 MPa. The pellets were covered with a thick layer of the same composition of powder to prevent Li evaporation and avoid Al3+ diffusion from crucibles followed by multistep sintering to acquire a dense and pure cubic phase. This multistep sintering process involved heating up to 900 °C at 5 °C min−1 and holding for 4 h and then further heating to 1130 °C at 5 °C min−1 and holding for 18 h before cooling to room temperature. All thermal processes were performed under atmospheric conditions by using Al2O3 crucibles. After the final thermal treatment, the pellets were stored in an argon-filled glovebox to prevent the possible contamination by carbon dioxide and moisture, which can affect the electrochemical properties. 30 mm diameter, 3 mm thick doped, hot-pressed LLZO pellets were prepared by loading the cubic phase powder into a graphite die with the support of carbon paper around the die wall, which was then hot-pressed at 900 °C for 30 min and at 1000 °C for 1 h under 40 MPa pressure in a flowing argon atmosphere. The hot-pressed samples were subjected to lower temperature than uniaxially cold-pressed sintered samples. The cooled pellets from the hot-press were again heated at 1000 °C for 4 h in atmospheric air to remove the residual graphite. After heating, the pellets were free of residual graphite and appeared bright white in color. The pellets were cut into 10 mm diameter and 1 mm-thick disks by using a diamond saw in mineral oil. For the electrochemical measurements, the pellets were polished on both sides to a mirror-polished surface by using 600-, 1200-, and 2000-grit SiC sandpaper.
Density and structure characterization
The ceramic density values were obtained through the Archimedes method with water for measurement. The ceramic densities of the pellets were estimated based on a theoretical density of 5.107 g cm−3. The phase purity of the doped LLZO powder sintered at 900 °C and the multi-sintered pellets at different temperatures was determined using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) through a Bruker D2 Phaser with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5405 Å). All diffraction patterns were recorded in the range of 10° &lt; 2θ &lt; 80° with a step size of 0.015°. The applied voltage and current were 30 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (SXRD) patterns were recorded from the 01C2 beamline with 25 keV X-rays at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Taiwan. An X-ray beam with a wavelength of 0.774916(1) Å was used, and the data were recorded between 5° &lt; 2θ &lt; 45°. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data were obtained using the beamline ECHIDNA at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization. The neutron beam wavelength was determined to be 1.62362(4) Å using the La11B6 NIST standard reference material (SRM660b). GSAS software was employed to analyze the NPD data. The Al occupancy at the tetrahedral-24d site was fixed at 0.06, which is close to the theoretical value derived from 1 wt% addition of Al2O3.20 The morphologies and microstructures of the doped LLZO pellets were analyzed using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) system by operating JEOL JSM-7610F at 15 kV. The samples were platinum-sputtered to eliminate any charge effect. The elemental composition and the presence of all common elements were obtained using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The mirror-polished pellets were gently broken into small pieces in an argon-filled glovebox and quickly moved for the analysis to minimize air exposure. To obtain more detailed structural information around Li and Ga environments, 7Li and 71Ga MAS NMR data were collected, respectively, at room temperature by using a Bruker Avance III spectrometer equipped with a 3.2 mm MAS probe head. The frequencies used for the 7Li and 71Ga nuclei were 155.5 and 121.951 MHz, respectively, by applying an external magnetic field of 14.1 T. The spinning speed of the samples was 12 kHz, and spectra were recorded after a single pulse irradiation (2–6 μs). The chemical shifts of 7Li and 71Ga were calibrated with 1 M LiCl and Ga(NO3)3, respectively. The spinning rate, position, line width, and intensity of components were automatically determined.
Conductivity measurements
The AC impedance of the SEs was determined using a Solartron SI1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer in the frequency range of 10 MHz to 0.1 Hz, with a signal amplitude of 0.1 V. All the doped LLZO pellets used in the electrochemical measurements have a thickness of 1.0–2.0 mm unless otherwise specified. The mirror-polished pellets were sputtered with Au as the blocking electrode on both sides and placed into a Swagelok cell in the Au|LLZO|Au configuration for electrochemical studies. The assembled cell was then connected with electrical wires to the impedance spectrometer. To measure the conductivity versus temperature, the AC impedance of the cells was measured from 20–120 °C. The cell was equilibrated for 1 h at each measurement. The impedance data were analyzed using Z Plot and Z View software packages. All impedance data were fitted with an equivalent circuit of the R(R//CPE)(R//CPE) model.
Fabrication of all-solid-state Li-ion batteries
A cathode slurry was prepared by mixing LiFePO4, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), KS6 carbon black, and bis-trifluoromethane sulfonamide (LiTFSI) as a lithium salt in the weight ratio of 10 : 2 : 1 : 7 by using an appropriate amount of NMP.34 Notably, the mixture of Li salt (LiTFSI) and the binder (PVDF) can form a polymer electrolyte.35 The slurry was homogeneously ground using a mortar and pestle for 30 min. The well-mixed slurry was spread equally on one side of a SE pellet followed by vacuum drying at 120 °C for 12 h. On the other side of the SE pellet pressed Li foil (thickness of around 20 μm) was placed as a negative electrode. The active material loading of the cathode was 2–3 mg cm−2.
Electrochemical measurements
For the electrochemical studies, the SE pellet with Li foil was sealed in a Swagelok cell in an argon glovebox. The cell was tested at room temperature between 2.7 and 3.8 V by using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Arbin BT2000) under open-air conditions.
