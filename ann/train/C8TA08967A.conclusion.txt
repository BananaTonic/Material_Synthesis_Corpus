4.Conclusions
This study revealed a facile method to increase the ionic conductivity of an SICSPE by manipulating its phase separation. TFSI anions were densely grafted along a PEEK backbone to form ionic nanowires. The nanowires were blends with the hyperbranched P(PEGMMA) polymer to form an SICSPE. Well-defined phase separation structures with continuously interconnected ionic channels were created in the SICSPE, which were visually observed by HRTEM bright-field images and STEM dark-field images. The prepared SICSPE showed high ionic conductivity of 0.17 × 10−3 to 1.01 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25–90 °C and outstanding tLi+ of 0.936–0.898 at 25–90 °C. The SICSPE membrane also displayed satisfactory electrochemical stability (maximum limiting voltage of 5.19–4.52 V at 25–90 °C). A half-cell using this blend membrane exhibited discharge capacities (0.2C) of 121.7 and 152.7 mA h g−1 at 25 and 60 °C, respectively. This study presented a promising strategy to design high-performance ion-conducting membranes that are attractive for LIB applications.
