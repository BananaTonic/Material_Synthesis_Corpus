Conclusion
A novel solid electrolyte with highly ordered ion channels was prepared using a nematic liquid crystal (C6M), ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) and lithium salt. Specifically, the free-standing solid-state composite polymer electrolyte film with highly ordered layered nanostructures was obtained through photopolymerization of the LC monomer with IL inserted into the layered nanostructures (transport ions). It should be noted that the LC was not only used as the active polymerable monomer but also acted as a highly ordered template to provide ion channels. As a result, the solid-state electrolyte film with ion channels showed a very high room temperature ionic conductivity (2.14 × 10−2 S cm−1), wide electrochemical window (4.8 V), and very good compatibility with lithium metal. More importantly, we also confirmed that the novel and free-standing solid electrolyte film could be used in LIBs. Specifically, the LFP/Li cell using the ordered electrolyte film showed superior cell performance (average discharge capacity reaches 150 mA h g−1). Our results provide a novel solid electrolyte material with highly ordered ion channels using liquid crystal and ionic liquid, which can be promisingly applied in solid LIBs.
