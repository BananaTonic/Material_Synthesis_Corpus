4.Conclusions
In summary, we present a simple and cost effective method for enhancing the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors by introducing indigo carmine as a redox mediator into the electrolyte. The supercapacitor with this redox-mediated electrolyte exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, such as, a high ionic conductivity of 20.27 mS cm−1, a high electrode specific capacitance of 382 F g−1, a high energy density of 13.26 W h kg−1, and an excellent cycle life that maintains 80.3% of the initial capacitance values after 3000 cycles. It can be inferred that the supercapacitor can be regarded as a novel hybrid supercapacitor that combines two energy-storage processes: the double-layer characteristic of carbon-based supercapacitors and the faradaic reaction characteristic of batteries. The simple preparation procedure, low cost and high performance of this novel idea and electrolyte can accelerate the development of supercapacitors and be applied to other electrochemical fields.
