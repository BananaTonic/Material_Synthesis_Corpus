Conclusion
In summary, we have presented a unique class of organic–inorganic hybrid electrolytes based on IL-grafted POSS. The electrolyte exhibits many remarkable features, including non-flammability, superior room temperature ion conductivity and excellent electrochemical stability, for Li–metal batteries. Prototype batteries using this electrolyte have been successfully cycled at room temperature. The plating–stripping experiments on a symmetrical cell with Li–metal electrodes confirmed the ability of POSS-IL to successfully mediate lithium deposition and dissolution. While considerable work remains to be done, we believe that this work provides a promising structural platform for the development of new solid-state electrolytes for ambient-temperature lithium batteries.
