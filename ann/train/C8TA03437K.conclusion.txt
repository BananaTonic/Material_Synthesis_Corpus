4Conclusions
In summary, a series of partially fluorinated poly(arylene ether) AEMs with functionalized claw-type side chains are prepared via nucleophilic substitution polycondensation, the Friedel–Crafts reaction, ketone reduction and functionalization. The claw-type cationic groups and the partially fluorinated poly(arylene ether) backbone are beneficial for fabricating well-defined hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase separation, and well-connected ion conducting channels, as confirmed by TEM and SAXS. As a result, the FPAE-3B-X-PD membranes exhibit a highest hydroxide conductivity of 98.19 mS cm−1 at 80 °C. Furthermore, the as-prepared AEMs demonstrate good dimensional stability and good thermal stability. The FPAE-3B-3.0-PD membrane still retained about 94% and 93% of its initial IEC and conductivity after being immersed into a 1 M aqueous KOH solution at 80 °C for 600 h, suggesting a good chemical stability. Besides, a highest power density of 156 mW cm−2 at a current density of 350 mA cm−2 at 80 °C is achieved using FPAE-3B-3.0-PD. Above all, the incorporation of the functionalized claw-type side chain and fluorinated moiety in the backbone is effective in improving the conductivity and alkaline stability of the AEMs simultaneously.
