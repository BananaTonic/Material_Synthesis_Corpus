2.1.Materials
Lithium nitrite (LiNO3) (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3·6H2O) (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), zirconium propoxide (Zr(OCH2CH2CH3)4) (70 wt% in 1-propanal, Sigma-Aldrich), dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, Mw = 1 300 000, Sigma-Aldrich), acetic acid (CH3COOH) (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), bis(trifluoromethanesulfoneimide) lithium salt (LiTFSI) (99.99%, Macklin), propylene carbonate (PC) (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), and polyvinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) (Mw = 400 000, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as purchased without further purification.
2.2.Synthesis of LLZO nanofibers
The LLZO nanofiber precursor was prepared by electrospinning (Scheme S1 in the ESI). To obtain the electrospinning solution, 7.7 mmol LiNO3, 3 mmol La(NO3)3·6H2O and 2 mmol Zr(OCH2CH2CH3)4 were dissolved in 10 mL DMF with 20 vol% acetic acid and kept stirring magnetically for 30 min. PVP was dissolved in DMF with a concentration of 15 wt%. The salt solution and the PVP solution were then mixed to form a 10 wt% transparent precursor solution. Electrospinning was carried out with a voltage of 15 kV and a feeding rate of 0.8 mL h−1. The distance from the syringe needle to the grounded drum collector was 15 cm. The rotation speed was controlled at around 200 rpm, and the humidity of the electrospinning chamber was about 20%. The as-spun nanofillers were subsequently sintered at 750 °C for various durations of 2, 2.5, 3 and 4 h in air with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1.
2.3.Preparation of the PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI/LLZO composite polymer electrolyte
PVDF-HFP and LiTFSI (2 : 1 weight ratio) were first dissolved in DMF and sonicated to form a homogeneous solution. 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% (total weight of PVDF-HFP and LiTFSI) LLZO nanofibers were then added. After magnetically stirring for 5 h, the mixture was cast onto cleaned Petri dishes. Finally, the CPE membranes were obtained by further drying at 70 °C under vacuum for 12 h to remove the DMF solvent44–46 and stored in an argon filled glove box (≤1 ppm H2O and O2). Scheme S2 illustrates the procedure used to fabricate the PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI/LLZO SPE membranes.
2.4.Characterization
The structure of LLZO nanofibers was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL-7100F) and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL-2010). The same SEM was used to observe the morphology of CPE membranes and to get the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of samples was performed under an air/nitrogen (N2) atmosphere with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 using a Perkin Elmer UNIX/TGA7 system. X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical X-ray diffractometer) was used for phase identification with Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å) in the 2θ range of 10° to 70°. Mechanical tests were performed using a DMA Q800 (TA Instrument) to evaluate the tensile strength.
Prior to electrochemical tests, the electrolyte membranes were soaked in the PC/LiTFSI electrolyte for 20 min to activate the polymer,47,48 and the excess electrolyte solution remaining on the surface of the membrane was removed by wiping with tissue paper. The uptake of the liquid electrolyte in the CPEs was measured and is summarized in Table S1. The CPE membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel (SS) electrodes to determine the ionic conductivity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were implemented on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) in a test chamber from 20 °C to 90 °C with a frequency of 1 × 10−5 Hz to 10 Hz. The ionic conductivity (σ) was calculated from eqn (1):1where a (cm2) is the area and l (cm) is the thickness of the CPE membrane. R (Ω) is the bulk resistance. The electrochemical window was determined with the same electrochemical workstation by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using Li/SS cells. The tests were carried out at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1 over the potential range of 0–6 V. The galvanostatic cycling test was carried out with symmetric Li cells using a Neware CT-4008 battery tester at a constant current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 and 0.5 mA cm−2 at room temperature. The electrochemical performance of the electrolyte was tested with LFP/Li half cells. To prepare the electrode, LFP nanopowder, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) and Super P (80 : 10 : 10 in weight ratio) were mixed in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) to form a homogeneous slurry which was subsequently coated on aluminum foil.49–51 The prepared electrode films with an active material loading of around 2.0 mg cm−2 were dried at 80 °C for 24 h under vacuum prior to use. Charge and discharge tests were carried out over 2.5–4.0 V after the cells were stayed for 8 h.
