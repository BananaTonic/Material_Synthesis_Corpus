4.Conclusions
The crystal structure of ammonium polyphosphate was completely resolved by a NPD study, by successive Fourier synthesis from the polyphosphate backbone. The structure consists of zig–zag chains aligned along the [001] directions of tetrahedral phosphate PO4 units that are connected through O3 atoms with a P–O3–P angle of 126.3(5)° at RT. The ammonium NH4 groups are located between these chains, bonded to the polyphosphate backbone through H-bond interactions (N–H⋯O–P). The thermal evolution of the structure shows that some H atoms subtly shift at high temperatures, resulting in a weakening of certain H-bonds, and thus increasing the lability of those H atoms involved in the proton conduction mechanism.
