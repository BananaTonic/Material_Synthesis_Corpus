Conclusions
A crosslink-free multi-block SPAES copolymer was successfully synthesized from hydrophilic and hydrophobic oligomers. Both highly purified oligomers and optimum solvent conditions were necessary to generate the high-molecular weight block SPAES. The presence of well-formed proton pathways from the hydrophilic clusters was confirmed by TEM; these explain the very high proton conductivity even under low RH conditions. The cell performance of SPAES was quite close to that of the state-of-the-art Aquivion membrane at 120 °C and 40% RH. This multi-block SPAES could be a strong candidate as an alternative to PFSA membranes for fuel-cell applications above 120 °C.
