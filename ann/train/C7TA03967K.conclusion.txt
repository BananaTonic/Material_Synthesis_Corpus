4.Conclusion
Novel nanofibrous membranes with poly-cation groups per side chain were designed and prepared by a facile and highly efficient method. Crosslinking of ionic side chains was performed to enhance mechanical integrity and induce phase separation between ionic side chains and main backbones. The effect of the polymer backbone as well as crosslinking degree on the physicochemical properties of the membranes was evaluated. Syn-PP based substrates provided better dimensional stability and were exceptionally stable in an accelerated degradation test compared to nylon based substrates. The main decrease in the stability was linked to the backbone of the polymer rather than ionic functionalities especially in the crosslinked samples. On the other hand, nylon based substrates showed very low MeOH permeability and a better conductivity/permeability ratio. Evaluation of hydroxide conductivity over temperature indicated that the activation energy is considerably higher in highly crosslinked samples. This reasonable stability and very easy and inexpensive synthesis and membrane fabrication along with high thermal stability of membranes indicate the high potential of the AEMs for operation at higher temperatures. Upon testing in a single cell, the syn-PP based AEM exhibited promising fuel cell performance at 80 °C. A high power density of 120.1 mW cm−2 and OCV of around 900 mV were obtained. Since the membranes are stable and their preparation method is flexible, further investigation will be focused on increasing their IEC to achieve higher conductivity. On the other hand, more work is yet to be carried out to further explore for appropriate ionomers and optimize the ionomer catalyst ratios.
