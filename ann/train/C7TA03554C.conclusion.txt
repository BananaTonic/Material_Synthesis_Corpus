4Conclusions
A new, simple and controllable approach was developed for the preparation of a series of OPBI microporous membranes by simply extracting PEG from dry OPBI/PEG blend membranes with water. The PEG molecular and weight fraction in the polymer blend have a great effect on pore formation and the higher Mw and fraction of PEG resulted in higher porosity. The porous membrane M-4 prepared from PEG of Mw = 10 000 at the weight ratio of OPBI/PEG = 1 : 5 displayed a fairly high porosity (71%), good pore penetrability, excellent wettability to both electrolyte and water, very high EU (316%), high ionic conductivity (1.3 mS cm−1 at room temperature), and acceptable mechanical strength (10 MPa). Furthermore, M-4 showed a high thermal resistance (∼5% shrinkage at 200 °C for 1 h) and excellent fire-retardant properties which are much better than that of the commercial separator Celgard 2400. The single cell assembled with M-4 exhibited a better C-rate performance and higher charge–discharge capacities than the one assembled with Celgard 2400 making it a promising separator candidate for use in LIBs.
