Conclusions
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict thermodynamically stable Li7+xMxP1−xS6 (M = Si, Ge) argyrodites. Solid-state reaction synthesis is in good agreement with the prediction, and solid solutions can be formed in the ranges of 0 &lt; x ≤ 0.4 and 0 &lt; x ≤ 0.35 for Li7+xSixP1−xS6 and Li7+xGexP1−xS6, respectively. Structural analysis based on Raman spectroscopy and Rietveld refinements of X-ray data confirms the substitution of P by Si/Ge. The substitution of P by Si and Ge in Li7PS6 stabilizes the HT phases even to −50 °C. The new argyrodite-type Li7+xMxP1−xS6 shows ionic conductivity over 10−3 S cm−1, and moreover, demonstrates a wide electrochemical window up to 5 V in the CV measurement and good compatibility with Li metal in a symmetric cell or a TiS2/SE/Li all-solid-state cell. Our new argyrodite-type Li7+xMxP1−xS6 lithium conductors could be a useful solid electrolyte candidate for all-solid-state batteries. Based on the above results, cation-doping in argyrodite materials could be an effective method to stabilize the high temperature phases with high ionic conductivity at ambient temperature and provide a promising strategy to explore new solid electrolytes.
