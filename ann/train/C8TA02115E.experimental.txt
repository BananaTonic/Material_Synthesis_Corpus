We synthesized (9,9-bis(3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)fluorene) (DMHF) and the branched monomer 1,3,5-tris[4-(4-fluorophenylsulfonyl)phenoxy]-benzene (B3) according to a previous method.35
Synthesis of 1-(6-bromohexyl)-3-methyl-imidazolium bromide (6BrIm)
As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI), 6BrIm was synthesized from 1,6-dibromohexane and 1-methylimidazole using a reported method.27 1,6-Dibromohexane (61.0 g, 250 mmol) was placed in a 250 mL three-necked round bottom flask with a magnetic stirrer. A mixture of 1-methylimidazole (4.1 g, 50 mmol) and acetone (50 mL) was added dropwise to the flask. The reaction mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 15 h. A viscous pale-yellow oil was obtained after purification using diethyl ether and ethyl acetate several times, and drying under vacuum for 24 h at 50 °C. The structure of 6BrIm was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
Synthesis of branched poly(arylene ether sulfone)s containing methoxy groups (HBMPES-x)
The HBMPES-x polymers (x denotes 100 × B3/(DMHF + 6F-BPA)) were synthesized using the route outlined in Scheme 1. A typical procedure for the synthesis of HBMPES-8 is described as follows. B3 (0.3123 g, 0.4 mmol), DMHF (0.9406 g, 2 mmol), 6F-BPA (1.0084 g, 3 mmol), FPS (1.1185 g, 4.4 mmol), K2CO3 (1.382 g, 10 mmol), DMAc (18 mL), and toluene (10 mL) were carefully placed in a 100 mL three-neck round bottom flask equipped with a Dean–Stark trap, nitrogen inlet and outlet, and magnetic stirring bar. The reaction mixture was heated at 140 °C for 4 h to remove an azeotrope of water and toluene, and then the temperature was subsequently increased to 170 °C to distil the toluene. The reaction was held at this temperature for 3–5 h. After the reaction, the resulting viscous mixture was diluted with DMAc (5 mL), cooled to room temperature, and poured slowly into a 200 mL mixture of methanol and deionized water (1/1, v/v) containing HCl (2 mL) to obtain a white precipitate. The precipitate was filtered and then rinsed with methanol and deionized water several times. The product was collected and dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 24 h (yield: 96%).
Synthesis of branched comb-shaped polymers HBMPES-x, HBHPES-x, and ImHBPES-x.
Synthesis of branched poly(arylene ether sulfone)s containing hydroxyl groups (HBHPES-x)
The demethylation reaction is described as follows. HBMPES-8 (3 g) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (100 mL) in a 250 mL three-neck flask with a nitrogen inlet. A mixture of BBr3 (4 mL) and CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was added dropwise to the HBMPES-8 solution at 0 °C in an ice bath. After 6 h, the resulting polymer (HBHPES-8) was filtered, washed with CH2Cl2 and deionized water several times, and finally dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h (yield: 94%).
Synthesis of branched poly(arylene ether sulfone)s containing 6BrIm (ImHBPES-x)
HBHPES-8 (1.0 g) was dissolved in DMSO (20 mL) at room temperature (RT) under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 100 mL three-neck flask. Next, 6BrIm (1.6 g), K2CO3 (0.94 g), and KI (0.05 g) were added to the mixture. The reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C for 12 h. The resulting mixture was cooled to RT and poured into acetone (200 mL) to obtain a brown precipitate (ImHBPES-8). The solid was washed with acetone and deionized water several times (yield: 89%).
Preparation of anion exchange membranes
ImHBPES-x (1 g) was dissolved in DMSO (10 mL) by stirring at RT. The solutions were filtered, cast on a clean glass plate, and then dried at 50 °C under vacuum for 24 h to obtain tough smooth membranes. The prepared membranes were soaked in 1.0 M aqueous KOH solution at RT for 48 h. Finally, the membranes were washed with deionized water three times and immersed in deionized water for at least 24 h before testing.
Characterization and measurements
The chemical structures of 6BrIm, HBMPES-x, HBHPES-x, and ImHBPES-x were confirmed using a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer using DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 as solvents and tetramethylsilane as the standard. The thermal stability of membranes was investigated using a Q50 TGA instrument (heating rate of 10 °C min−1, temperature range of RT to 700 °C, nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations were carried out on a Zeiss Supra 55 SEM to investigate the membrane morphology. Phase images of membranes were obtained using an atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode. The mechanical properties of membranes were measured using an Instron 1185 analyzer under ambient conditions at a test speed of 2 mm min−1. The water contact angles of the membranes were measured at RT using the pendant-drop method.
Positron annihilation lifetime (PALS) measurements
The positron annihilation experiments were conducted based on previous literature reported methods.38,39 A 22Na source (∼50 μCi) was firstly sandwiched by around 20 pieces of membranes (1 × 1 cm2) and then covered with Al foil. And the as-prepared samples were installed in a testing chamber with 42% relative humidity. The average radius of free volumes was used to determine the ortho-positronium (o-Ps) lifetime according to a spherical approximation given by the Tao–Eldrup model40,41 as the following equation:1where R0 = R + ΔR, and ΔR = 0.166 nm is the thickness of the o-Ps wave function overlapping with the homogeneous electron layer. The average size of the free volumes VFV,Ps can be calculated with the following equation:2
Density
The values of density (ρ) were calculated with the following equation:3where Wdry is the weight of the dry sample and Vdry is the volume of the dry membrane.
Ion exchange capacity (IEC)
The IEC of the membranes was determined by a classical titration measurement. The membrane (0.05 g) was soaked in 0.01 M HCl standard solution (60 mL) for 24 h. Next, the solution was titrated with 0.01 M NaOH standard solution using phenolphthalein as an indicator. The IEC values were calculated using the following relationship:4where Wdry is the weight of the dried membrane, V0 NaOH and Vx NaOH are the volumes of NaOH standard solution consumed without and with the membrane presented during titration, respectively, and CNaOH is the concentration of NaOH standard solution.
Water uptake and swelling ratio
The water uptake (WU) and swelling ratio (SR) of the membranes were determined as follows. The membranes were immersed in deionized water at the desired temperature for 24 h. They were then wiped with tissue paper and their weight (Wwet), width, and length were quickly measured. The weights of dried membranes (Wdry) were obtained after drying at 80 °C under vacuum for 24 h.56where ldry and wdry are the length and width of the dry membrane, respectively, and lwet and wwet are the length and width of the wet membrane, respectively.
Ionic conductivity
The resistance (R) of the membranes (1 × 4 cm2 in deionized water) was measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner IM6ex, Germany) by a four-electrode AC impedance method over the frequency range from 1 to 105 Hz. Ionic conductivity (σ) was measured in deionized water at temperatures from 30 to 80 °C and calculated as follows:7where l (cm) is the distance between the two electrodes and A (cm2) is the cross-sectional area of the tested membrane.
Alkaline stability
The alkaline stability of the membranes was investigated by soaking the membranes in 1 M KOH aqueous solution at 60 °C for 550 h. The condition of membranes was evaluated through photographs, σ, and 1H NMR spectra. After testing, the membranes were washed with deionized water several times and then immersed in deionized water for at least 24 h to remove the free KOH inside the membrane. σ was measured in deionized water at 60 °C.
Membrane electrode assembly and fuel cell tests
The fuel cell tests required control of the temperature, pressure, and fuel flow. The anode and cathode Pt/C electrodes were purchased from Johnson Matthey. The Pt loading of both the anode and cathode was 1 mg cm−2. The electrodes were painted with 5% ionomer (ImHBPES-8) in DMSO. The membrane electrode assemblies with an active area of 2.25 × 2.25 cm, were hot-pressed at 50 °C for 5 min under a pressure of 1.6 MPa. The feeds of fully humidified H2 (anode) and O2 (cathode) were supplied at rates of 50 and 100 mL min−1, respectively. The H2/O2 single fuel cell performance was tested at 60 °C using an Arbin® BT-5HC multiple independent channel fuel cell test station.
