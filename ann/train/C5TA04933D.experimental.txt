Materials
12-Crown-4, lithium iodide (LiI) and iodine (I2) were purchased from Alfa Aesar and were used as received. PMII was purchased from Merck. H2PtCl6 and the organic dye Z-907 were purchased from Aldrich. All the chemical reagents were used without further treatment. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrodes (8 Ω sq−1), and slurries containing 20 nm-sized mesopores and 200 nm-diameter light-scattering TiO2 colloids were purchased from Dalian Hepat Chroma Solar Tech. Co., Ltd (China).
Synthesis of [Li∈12-C-4][I]
[Li∈12-C-4][I] was synthesized as follows: briefly, a mixture of 12-crown-4 (31 mmol, 5.46 g) and LiI (30 mmol, 4.02 g) in 20 mL of ethanol was stirred at 50 °C for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the evaporation of the solvent, the excess 12-crown-4 was further removed by vacuum distillation at 80 °C. The product was dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h to produce [Li∈12-C-4][I] with a yield of 98%.
Preparation of [Li∈12-C-4][I] based solid-state electrolytes
The components of the solid-state electrolytes employed in this work are listed in Table 1. All the electrolytes were dried under vacuum at room temperature for 48 h before the characterization and fabrication of the DSSCs. The thermal stability of sample A (12-crown-4) and electrolyte B ([Li∈12-C-4][I]) was tested by TGA. For DSC analysis, sample A and the electrolytes B–G containing different contents of PMII were measured. Since I2 is needed to form the I3− ions for the electron relay at the counter electrode, the addition of 20 wt% I2 to electrolyte B will give electrolyte I for the fabrication of DSSCs. Moreover, by combining electrolyte I and 200 wt% PMII, electrolyte J was also prepared. For comparison, a typical organic liquid electrolyte as a reference device contains 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M I2 in MPN.33,34

The fabrication of the DSSCs was carried out as documented in the previous literature.21 The cleaned FTO glass was covered at two parallel edges with adhesive tape to control the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 film. Two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto the cleaned FTO glass and were used as photoelectrodes. A 10 μm thick film of 20 nm sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Then, a second 5 μm thick layer of 200 nm light-scattering anatase particles was coated on the top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in a 0.3 mM solution of MK-2 in anhydrous toluene at room temperature for 12 h. The dyed TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with a nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 5 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol were placed onto a cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min.
The DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching the methanol solution of an electrolyte between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a pre-drilled Pt counter electrode by a 40 μm hot melt ring (Surlyn, DuPont). The resulting cells were placed under vacuum at 50 °C overnight to remove the air to guarantee the optimum filling and fine electrical contact. The produced devices were sealed with a Surlyn sheet and a thin glass cover by heating.
Characterization and measurements
1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the synthesized compounds were recorded on a Varian CP-3800 spectrometer in the range of 4000–400 cm−1. Thermal analysis was carried out on a Universal Analysis 2000 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The samples were heated from 50 to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in a temperature range of −50 to 200 °C on a DSC-Q200 device.
The XRD patterns of the films were obtained using a Rigaku D/MAX-2000 PC diffraction system to evaluate the crystal structure and lattice constants, with the diffraction angle 2θ ranging from 5° to 80°. According to eqn (1), the interlayer distances between the planes in the atomic lattice can be calculated.12d sin θ = nλwhere λ is the wavelength (=0.154 nm) of the incident beam, θ is the angle between the incident ray and the scattering plane, and n is an integer.
The conductivity of the electrolytes was characterized between two identical platinum sheets (diameter of 1 cm) on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation, using the AC impedance method over the frequency range 0.01 Hz to 105 Hz and an amplitude of 10 mV. The conductivity was calculated using eqn (2):17,21–232where σ is the conductivity in S cm−1, R is the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte, l is the distance between the two electrodes, and S is the area of the electrolyte.
All the samples were equilibrated for at least 20 min at a given temperature. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an aluminum foil mask with an aperture area of ∼0.25 cm2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under a simulated air mass (AM) of 1.5 and solar spectrum illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was plotted as a function of the excitation wavelength and was recorded on a Keithley 2612 source meter under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp with a monochromator (Oriel CornerstoneTM 260 1/4). The photoelectrochemical parameters, such as the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated according to the previous reports.3,4,16,17
