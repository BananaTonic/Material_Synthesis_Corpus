4.Conclusions
In summary, an ultrafast laser-assisted reaction of hydrogenated molybdenum oxide (HyMoO3−x) thin films was demonstrated. The stoichiometry of the HyMoO3−x layer was controlled by laser energy, thereby resulting in beneficial electronic properties such as high WF (5.6 eV) and electrical conductivity (9.9 μS cm−1). When the laser-assisted reaction was conducted for the preparation of hole transport layers for organic solar cells, the annealing time was reduced by a factor of 109 compared to conventional thermal annealing. The HyMoO3−x HTL was effective not only for charge transport but also for light trapping in flexible top-illuminated OSCs. A flexible device with HyMoO3−x exhibited enhancement of the short-circuit current by 75% compared to the device with PEDOT:PSS. The optical simulation verifies that the thin layer of HyMoO3−x (3 nm) is effective for light absorption in the microcavity, where the resonant wavelength matches with the absorption band of PTB7:PCBM. This laser-assisted low-temperature and ultrafast reaction method can be conducted for other transition metal oxides, and is suitable for R2R fabrication of flexible electronics.
