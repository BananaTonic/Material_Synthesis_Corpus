Conclusions
This research has developed a synthetic method for the preparation of PSf–PDApipOH multiblock copolymer membranes. The synthesis method produced the first examples of hydrophobic–hydrophilic block copolymers that incorporate spirocyclic, aliphatic ammonium repeat units. This work demonstrates degenerative chain transfer radical cyclopolymerization of diallylpiperidinium chloride to produce difunctional oligomers that were subsequently copolymerized by step-growth techniques. The resulting PSf–PDApipPF6 multiblock copolymers were found to be solution processible and produced durable films. Tapping mode AFM indicated phase separation between the PSf and PDApipPF6 segments with continuous PDApipPF6 domains forming as the weight fraction increased. The polymer structure and phase-separated morphology resulted in materials with low water uptake, high hydroxide conductivity, and sufficient mechanical properties. The PDApipOH material was shown by 1H NMR spectroscopy to be highly alkaline stable with no observable degradation at 80 °C over 1000 hours. Furthermore, assessment of the alkaline stability of PSf–PDApip multiblock copolymers indicated that these materials show remarkable tolerance to base at high temperature, indicated by thermogravimetric analysis in the hydroxide form. The promising results encourage further research on developing PDApipOH containing materials for their application in alkaline fuel cells.
