4.Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized three proton-conducting coordination complexes and firstly demonstrated that change of the sulfonate group coordination modes and introduction of halide ions as well as different packing modes may both remarkably enhance the proton conductivity of coordination compounds. Not only can more uncoordinated sulfonate acid groups increase proton conductivity, but also halide Cl ions and the sulfonate acid group between adjacent chains may form hydrophilic pathways as well as the packing mode to enhance proton conductivity. Interestingly, the HCl steam-assisted conversion method may tend to protect sulfonated acid groups against coordination with metal ions and enable the –SO3− group to be protonated, which results in enhanced proton conductivity. Three resulting coordination complexes showed high proton conductivity with a maximum value of 1.43 mS cm−1 for 1, 2.58 mS cm−1 for 2 and 15 mS cm−1 for 3 at 95 °C and 97% RH. In addition, D2O-exchange experiments and the Hebb–Wagner polarization method indicate that the materials are proton conducting materials. This work may provide a new synthetic strategy to design and adjust nonporous proton-conducting materials by using free sulfonate acid groups and encourage future work in proton conductivity control and understanding the proton conduction mechanism of PEMFCs in real-life applications.
