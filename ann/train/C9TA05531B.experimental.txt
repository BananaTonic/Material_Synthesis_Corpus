4.2Polymer synthesis
Monomer synthesis
Monomers 1 and 2 were synthesized in three steps as shown in Scheme 2. All steps except the deprotection using HCl were performed under a N2 atmosphere. Here follows a typical procedure for synthesis of monomer 2. 1-N-Boc-4-Methylene-piperidine (5.08 g, 25.8 mmol, 1 eq.) was added in a 100 ml one-neck round flask, and then degassed and cooled to 0 °C using an ice bath. A solution of 9BBN 0.5 M in THF (51.5 ml, 25.8 mmol, 1 eq.) was added and the white reaction mixture was stirred during 2 h before the ice bath was removed. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for an additional 2 h, and then degassed and added dropwise to a degassed mixture of 4′-bromo-2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone (6.52 g, 25.8 mmol, 1 eq.), KOH (2.60 g, 46.4 mmol, 1.8 eq.), Pd(PPh3)4 (0.431 g, 0.373 mmol, 0.0145 eq.), toluene (25 ml) and deionized (DI) water (45 ml) in a 250 ml two-neck round flask equipped with a condenser and N2 inlet. The mixture was stirred at 60 °C overnight and then extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic phase was washed with brine, then dried with MgSO4 and evaporated under reduced pressure until dry. The crude product was purified further by dry column vacuum chromatography,51 using an EtOAc : heptane mixture (0 : 100 to 50 : 50) as the eluent. The still impure product was added to a 100 ml round flask containing HCl (conc., 25 ml) and DI water (25 ml) and then heated to 80 °C overnight. The solution was then cooled to 0 °C and filtered. The precipitate was recrystallized in water, yielding monomer 2 (in the hydrated form) as a white powder (5.0 g, total isolated yield 63%).
Polymerization
The three precursor polymers P1, P2m and P2p were synthesized by polycondensation of either monomer 1 with 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone or of monomer 2 with m- or p-terphenyl, respectively, under a N2 atmosphere, using triflic acid as the catalyst (Scheme 3). Here follows the description of the synthesis of polymer P1 as an example. To a 25 ml two-neck round flask equipped with mechanical stirrer and N2 inlet monomer 1 in chloride form (1.00 g, 2.75 mmol, 1 eq.), 2,2,2-trifluoroacetophenone (0.424 ml, 3.02 mmol, 1.1 eq.) and anhydrous DCM (2.4 ml) were added. The mixture was cooled to 0 °C using an ice bath, followed by the dropwise addition of TFSA (2.4 ml, 27 mmol, 10 eq.). The mixture was stirred at 0 °C during 24 h. The highly viscous reaction mixture was then diluted with DMSO and precipitated in IPA. The precipitate was washed twice with diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum, yielding polymer P1 (1.65 g, 94% isolated yield) as white powder.
Quaternization
The cationic polymers P1Me, P2mMe and P2pMe were prepared by quaternization of the respective precursor polymers, using MeI in NMP and K2CO3 as the catalyst. The synthesis of P1Me is described here as an example. Polymer P1 (0.6 g, 0.95 mmol, 1 eq.), K2CO3 (0.39 g, 2.8 mmol, 3 eq.), NMP (10 ml) and MeI (0.29 ml, 4.7 mmol, 5 eq.) were added in a 50 ml one-neck round bottom flask. The bottle was covered in aluminium foil to prevent light-induced degradation of MeI and left stirring at room temperature for 48 h. The product was then precipitated in IPA, washed repeatedly with IPA and water, and finally dried under vacuum to give P1Me as a light yellow powder.
Polymer P1Pi was prepared by cyclo-quaternization of polymer P1 with 1,5-dibromopentane, using DIPEA as the catalyst. A solution of polymer P1 (0.6 g, 0.95 mmol, 1 eq.) in NMP (10 ml) was added dropwise into a 50 ml round bottom flask containing 1,5-dibromopentane (0.14 ml, 1.0 mmol, 1.1 eq.), DIPEA (0.82 ml, 4.7 mmol, 5 eq.) and NMP (14 ml) at 80 °C. Next, the reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C during 24 h. The product was then precipitated in IPA, washed repeatedly with IPA and water and dried under vacuum to give P1Pi as a red brown powder.
Characterization
The molecular structure of the polymers was confirmed from 1H NMR spectra recorded at 400 MHz using a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer. The solvents used were either DMSO-d6 or a mixture of DMSO-d6 and TFA.
The intrinsic viscosity of the precursor polymers P1, P2m and P2p was measured at 30 °C using an Ubbelohde viscometer. Samples were dried at 50 °C under vacuum for at least 48 h, weighed, and dissolved in 0.1 M LiBr in DMSO solution (blank solution) to obtain stock solutions with a concentration between 0.83 and 1.29 g dL−1. These solutions were later diluted with the blank solution to reduce their concentrations. The resulting solutions were used immediately after preparation. The flow times of the blank solution through the capillary (tblank) and of the polymer solutions (tsample) were taken as the average of four measurements. The inherent (ηinh) and reduced (ηred) viscosities at four different concentrations were calculated as:12
The intrinsic viscosity ([η]) was calculated as the average of the intersections of the linear regressions of ηinh and ηred with the y-axis.
4.3Membrane preparation and characterization
Membrane preparation
HEMs were cast from 5 wt% polymer solutions in DMSO at 80 °C. Approximately 0.15 g polymer was dissolved in DMSO to obtain a 3 g solution. This solution was filtered through a syringe-driven filter unit (ø = 25 mm, Fluoropore membrane, 5 μm) onto a Petri dish (ø = 50 mm) which was then placed in a ventilated casting oven at 80 °C for at least 24 h. Subsequently, the resulting HEM was immersed in 1 M aq. NaBr solution for at least 7 days to obtain the bromide form, and then washed thoroughly with DI water before storage in DI water. Membranes of the polymers functionalized with monocyclic piperidinium P1Me, P2mMe and P2pMe were flexible and almost colorless while the P1Pi membranes were darker in colour and less flexible.
HEMs in the hydroxide form were prepared by ion-exchange in 1 M aq. NaOH solution during at least 96 h. Next, the membrane was washed thoroughly with degassed DI water and stored in degassed DI water under nitrogen during 48–72 h before the measurement.
Small angle X-ray scattering
Phase separation by ionic clustering was studied by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements of the dry HEMs in the bromide form. Membrane samples were dried under vacuum prior to the measurements. Data were collected in the q-range 0.14–7.5 nm−1 using a SAXSLAB SAXS instrument (JJ X-ray Systems Aps, Denmark) equipped with a Pilatus detector.
Ion exchange capacity
The IEC of the HEMs in the bromide (IECBr) form was determined by titration. The membranes were first dried at 50 °C under vacuum during 48 h and weighed to obtain their dry weights. The dry membranes were then immersed in 25 ml 0.2 M aq. NaNO3 solution at 40–50 °C for 7 days. Next the solutions were titrated with an aq. AgNO3 solution (approx. 0.01 M), using an aq. K2CrO4 solution (0.1 M) as the indicator. The IEC of the HEMs in the hydroxide form (IECOH) was calculated from the IECBr as3
Thermal stability
The thermal decomposition of the HEMs in the bromide form and of precursor polymers in the protonated state with triflate counter ions was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) using a TGA Q500 (TA Instruments) during heating from 50 to 600 °C at 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. In order to remove water residues, the samples were kept isothermally at 120 °C for 20 min prior to the analysis. The thermal decomposition temperature was reported at 5% weight loss (Td,95).
Water uptake
The dry weight of the membranes (mdry,Br) in the bromide form was measured after 48 h drying at 50 °C under vacuum. By assuming that all Br− was exchanged to OH−, the dry weight of the HEMs in the hydroxide form (mdry) was calculated from mdry,Br as4mdry = mdry,Br × (1 − 0.0629 × IECBr)
Subsequently, the HEMs were ion-exchanged to the hydroxide form. The weights of the hydrated membranes (mwet) were obtained after equilibration in DI water at 20, 40, 60 and 80 °C. Finally their water uptake was calculated as:5
Hydroxide conductivity
The hydroxide ion conductivity of the hydrated HEMs was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using a two-probe set-up and a Novocontrol high-resolution dielectric analyzer V 1.01S. During the measurements, the membranes were kept hydrated in a closed cell filled with DI degassed water. The voltage amplitude was maintained at 50 mV while varying the frequency from 107 to 100 Hz in the temperature range of 20 to 80 °C.
Alkaline stability
The alkaline stability of all HEMs at 90 and 120 °C was evaluated after immersion in 2 M aq. NaOH solution for different periods of time. After the immersion, the membranes were exchanged to the bromide form and dissolved in mixtures of DMSO-d6 and TFA before analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
