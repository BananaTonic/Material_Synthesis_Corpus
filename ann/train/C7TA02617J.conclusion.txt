Conclusions
We have developed and demonstrated three solution processable perylene diimides, i.e., X-PDI, X = H, F, or Br, as non-fullerene electron accepting and electron transporting materials in inverted PVSCs. Whereas H-PDI or F-PDI performs unsatisfactorily, our best PVSC is based on Br-PDI exhibiting PCE of 3.23%, which is just a bit shy of 4.13% of fullerene (PC61BM) PVSCs. Through a series of physical, spectroscopic, and microscopic studies, we have understood that the low solubility of F-PDI is a major factor causing the poor quality of the thin film, rendering virtually no photovoltaic effect for F-PDI. Although the solubility is better than F-PDI, the inferior electron mobility and conductivity, compared with those of Br-PDI make H-PDI PVSCs have relatively worse performance. Having the highest solubility, electron mobility, and conductivity among X-PDI, Br-PDI-based PVSCs are almost as efficient as PC61BM-based PVSCs. Except for F-PDI, the PCEs of PVSCs based on X-PDI or PC61BM are significantly improved to 7.78%, 10.50%, and 11.07%, respectively, once solution processed ZnO NP are included in the PVSCs as a CBL. We infer that the CBL of ZnO NP has the function of interspace-filling on the defect of H-PDI, Br-PDI, or PC61BM thin film, reducing the direct contact of Ag cathode to the perovskite material. Due to the strong molecular interaction, F-PDI aggregates significantly in thin film, creating too many and too large defects to be remedied or improved with or without CBL of ZnO NP. Very poor electron mobility and conductivity of F-PDI are two other factors devastating its PVSCs.
