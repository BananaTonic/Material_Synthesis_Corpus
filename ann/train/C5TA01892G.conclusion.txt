Conclusions
In summary, we introduced an ideal AAO separator structure for a lithium ion battery system. The electrochemical performances of lithium ion batteries tend to depend on the structural properties of the separator. The porous framework and vertically straight channels with extremely low tortuosity allow for improved battery efficiency, better conductivity, higher discharging capacity, and superior rate retention capability. Through electrochemical experiments and computer-aided simulation, highly ordered hexagonal pore arrays were found to effectively allow lithium ion migration and evenly distribute the current density. This can effectively suppress lithium dendrite growth on the lithium metal surface. Li metal is an ideal anode material due to these powerful capabilities.
