Conclusions
The formation of a series of polymer films, representing semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs) with chemically attached ionic groups was studied. Such ionic semi-IPNs were developed using a simple one-step process. The ionic network formed by radical copolymerization of an ionic liquid like monomer (N-[2-(2-(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl]-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide) with poly(ethylene glycol)(di)methacrylates acts as a solid polymer electrolyte, whereas nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) ensures the reinforcement of mechanical properties.
In the unfilled state, the semi-IPN with 20 wt% of NBR content shows the best compromise between perfect mechanical properties (tensile strength: 290 kPa, elongation: 150%) and ionic conductivity of 8.0 × 10−7 S cm−1 at 25 °C. Semi-IPNs of the same composition filled with 44 wt% of N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide and 12 wt% of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide demonstrate an ionic conductivity higher than 10−4 S cm−1 (25 °C) while maintaining a tensile strength of 80 kPa and an elongation of 60%.
The most striking advantages of the suggested approach in comparison with linear polymeric ionic liquids are as follows: (1) significant improvement in the stress–strain properties of the films even in the filled state; (2) lowering of polymer Tg and increasing of the ions' mobility; (3) imparting of high ionic conductivity (up to 1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and (4) preservation of a high electrochemical stability window (4.9 V versus Li/Li+).
Preliminary battery tests have demonstrated that Li/LiFePO4 flexible cells with semi-IPN based electrolyte are capable to deliver a 77 mA h g−1 average specific capacity at 40 °C during 75 charge/discharge cycles, thus making the films with semi-IPN architecture promising candidates for stretchable electronics.
