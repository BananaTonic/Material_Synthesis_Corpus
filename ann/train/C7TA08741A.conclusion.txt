4Conclusions
A new polyethylene-supported ultra-thin polymer electrolyte was successfully prepared by blending environmentally friendly and low-cost HEC with tough PVDF as the raw material through a simple dipping method along with activation in a liquid electrolyte. The large surface area, robust mechanical properties, excellent thermal stability and sufficient electrolyte wettability allow the PE-supported GPE (PVDF : HEC = 3 : 1) to exhibit better cycle and rate performances. The wide electrochemical window and high Li+ conductivity demonstrate that the electrolyte is suitable for LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 as well as other electrodes.
