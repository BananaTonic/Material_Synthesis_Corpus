Conclusions
The PEG-grafted SEBS-based AAEMs with high mechanical and chemical stability and conductivity were designed, prepared and characterized. When subjected to tensile strain, the elongation at the breaking point of SEBS-based AAEMs is 80 times greater than that of the polystyrene-based membranes. Remarkably, these AAEMs were stable enough in 2.5 M KOH at 60 °C for about 3000 h, which is rare in the recent literature. Furthermore, the properties of the membranes could be optimized by modulating the CD of SEBS, PEG molecular weight or the PEG-grafting degree. Especially, the grafting of PEG could enhance the conductivity of these AAEMs (80 °C, from 29.2 mS cm−1 to 51.9 mS cm−1) due to the enlargement of the ion-conducting channels (as revealed by TEM). The peak power density of an H2/O2 single fuel cell using this SEBS-based AAEM was up to 146 mW cm−2 at 50 °C.
However, the relationship between the conductivity of AAEM and the size of ion-conducting channel remains unclear. The size of the hydrated OH− is still also unclear, thus the size of the channel that would be most favorable for the conduction of OH− in AAEM is a subject of debate. It is necessary to adequately understand the influence of the microscale structure (especially the size of the ion-conducting channels) on the properties of the AAEM, which is important for enhancing the properties of AAEM by designing the microscale-structure.
