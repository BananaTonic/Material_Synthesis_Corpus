Experimental
Materials
Dichloromethane, diethyl carbonate, chlorodimethylsilane, triethyl amine (NEt3), tetraethylene glycol, potassium carbonate, 2-(2-(vinyloxy)ethoxy)ethanol, diethyl carbonate, toluene and anhydrous acetonitrile were purchased from VWR and used without further purification. Platinum divinyltetramethyldisiloxane complex (Pt[dvs]) (3% in xylene) catalyst, diethyldihydrosilane, tri(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether, di(ethylene glycol) divinyl ether, RhCl(PPh3)3 catalyst and polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS, Mn = 3360) were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) from EMD Chemicals was refluxed over sodium metal before use. The polysiloxane-based ionomer was prepared by the method reported in ref. 13 with borate content of 14 mol%.
Characterization
1H, 13C and 29Si NMR spectroscopy were recorded on a Bruker AM 300M spectrometer. Glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined using a TA Q100 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) at 10 K min−1 heating and cooling rates. Dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) measurements were conducted on samples sandwiched between two polished brass electrodes, with 50 μm silica spacers placed in between the two electrodes. The sandwiched samples were positioned in a Novocontrol GmbH Concept 40 broadband dielectric spectrometer and the dielectric permittivity and conductivity were measured using an AC voltage amplitude of 0.1 V and 10−2 to 107 Hz frequency range. Prior to the DRS measurements, the samples were annealed in the Novocontrol at 120 °C in a heated stream of dry nitrogen for 1 hour to drive off any moisture picked up during loading of these hygroscopic materials. Data were collected in isothermal frequency sweeps from 120 °C to near Tg. Linear viscoelastic measurements were conducted with an Advanced Rheometric Expansion System (ARES-LS, Rheometric Scientific). Parallel plates with diameters of 25 mm were utilized to conduct dynamic frequency sweeps at room temperature (20 °C). Strain amplitudes lower than 0.1 were applied and confirmed to be in the linear response region.
Cyclic [(allyloxy) methyl] ethylene ester carbonic acid (CECA)
CECA was prepared according to the method reported in ref. 13. Potassium carbonate (3 g, 21.7 mmol) was added to a mixture of 3-(allyloxy)-propane-1,2-diol (92.4 g, 0.188 mol) and diethyl carbonate (24.8 g, 0.188 mol). After stirring at 120 °C for 24 h, the mixture was filtered to isolate the solid. The residue was purified by Kügelrohr distillation to yield the pure product as a colorless liquid (23.7 g, 80%). 1H NMR (in CDCl3), δ(ppm) 5.87 (m, 1H, CCH), 5.25 (d, 1H, cis H of CH2C), 5.14 (d, 1H, trans H of CH2C), 4.86 (m, 1H, CCH(C)O), 4.38–4.55 (m, 2H, CH2C), 4.06 (m, 2H, OCH2CC), 3.60–3.74 (m, 2H, OCCH2O).
Tri(ethylene glycol) allyl methyl ether (vinyl PEO3)
To a mixture of NaH (1.44 g, 60% in mineral oil) dispersed in 20 mL dry THF was added a solution of tri(ethylene glycol) methyl ether (4.7 mL, 0.03 mol) in 150 mL of THF dropwise at ice-bath temperature. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours before being transferred into a solution of allyl bromide (3.58 g, 0.03 mol) in 20 mL dry THF. The mixture was allowed to react overnight to complete the reaction. The reaction was quenched by ice water and extracted by ethyl acetate (20 mL × 3). The organic phases were combined and condensed by rotavap. The yellowish liquid was then purified by vacuum distillation to yield vinyl PEO3 (5.5 g, 90%). 1H NMR (in d6-acetone), δ(ppm) 5.85 (m, 1H, CH), 5.2, (d, cis H of CH2), 5.1 (d, trans H of CH2), 3.95 (d, 2H, CCCH2), 3.8–3.6 (m, 8H, OCH2CH2O), 3.35 (s, CH3).
General procedure for synthesis of homopolymer and random copolymer plasticizers CPP (0, 19 31, 57, 80, 100)
All starting materials were dried using molecular sieves before use. PMHS was added into a pre-dried flask equipped with a condenser. The desired amount of CECA and vinyl PEO3 were charged into the flask followed by 20 mL anhydrous CH3CN and 0.2 mL Pt catalyst. The reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C. The completion of the reaction was confirmed by 1H NMR. The reaction time was in the range of 2–7 days. The mixture was condensed by rotovap and the residue was dissolved in toluene and precipitated in hexane 3 times. Afterwards, the product was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 24 hours.
