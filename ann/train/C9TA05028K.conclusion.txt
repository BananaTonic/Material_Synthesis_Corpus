4.Conclusions
In summary, a series of cyclophosphazene-based hybrid polymer electrolytes were designed and fabricated by a facile epoxy–amine reaction between HAmCP and PEGDE with different molecular weights. Mechanical strength and thermal stability were investigated in detail; it was revealed that CHPE4000 possessed high thermal stability up to 368 °C and could be stretched up to 127% in the tensile elongation test owing to the phosphazene core and the cross-linking structure. In addition, CHPE4000 possessed excellent ionic conductivity up to 1.04 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C and superior electrochemical stability. Due to the flame-retardant cyclophosphazene, CHPE500 exhibited a self-extinguishing effect compared with the flammable P(PEGDA) specimen. Furthermore, the cell prepared using CHPE4000 as the separator showed a very stable cycling performance under 0.2C rate. Therefore, the cyclophosphazene-based hybrid polymer electrolyte is a promising prototype for fabricating all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries.
