2.1.Preparation of electrolytes
The triisobutylmethylphosphonium bis(fluorosulphonyl)imide (P1i444FSI) OIPC was synthesized according to a previous report.42 Particularly, triisobutylmethylphosphonium tosylate water solution (with 27.2 g, 0.07 mol of triisobutylmethylphosphonium tosylate) was mixed with KFSI solution (with 16.8 g, 0.077 mol, of KFSI) under magnetic stirring at room temperature. The formed white precipitate was collected by filtration and dissolved in 50 mL dichloromethane (DCM), then washed 5 times with deionized (DI) water in a separatory funnel. The final product was obtained by removing DCM using a rotatory evaporator and dried under vacuum on a Schlenk line at 50 °C for 3 days, which gave a water content less than 50 ppm (determined by Karl Fischer titration analysis). Sodium bis(fluorosulphonyl)imide (NaFSI) (99.99%) was purchased from Solvionic and used without further purification. Mixtures of P1i444FSI/NaFSI containing various amounts of NaFSI were prepared inside an argon-atmosphere glove box. Homogenous solutions were obtained for lower concentrations of sodium salt by stirring and heating at 80 °C. For higher NaFSI concentration samples, distilled acetone was added to obtain a homogenous solution, and the acetone was then removed under high vacuum at 60 °C for 2 days. All samples were stored in sealed vials under an argon atmosphere inside the glove box. The chemical structure of P1i444FSI is shown in Fig. 1.

2.2.Characterization
2.2.1.Thermal characterization
A Netzsch DSC 214 Polyma with liquid N2 cooling, driven by Proteus 70 software, was used for thermal measurements. 5–10 mg samples were sealed in Al pans inside an argon-filled glove box. Typically, samples were cooled at 5 °C min−1 from room temperature to −100 °C and, after an isothermal equilibration time of 10 min, heated to 100 °C at the same scan rate. In some cases, a specific thermal cycling method was applied to crystallise the samples.
2.2.2.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
A Biologic MTZ-35 Analyser was used to evaluate solid- and liquid-state ionic conductivity of pure P1i444FSI and NaFSI and their mixtures. Data was analysed with MT-Lab® software. EIS data was collected across a frequency range of 10 MHz to 0.1 Hz with a 100 mV amplitude and over a temperature range of −20 °C to 70 °C in 10 °C intervals. An equilibration time of 20 minutes was allowed at each temperature.
A Eurotherm 2204 temperature controller attached to the MTZ-35 was used to control the temperature automatically throughout the experiments. A thermocouple embedded in a brass block (that also contained a cavity to fit the dip cell) was used for temperature measurements.
Pre-dried pure OIPC mixed samples were placed inside a lab-designed dip cell equipped with two platinum wires protected by glass. The cell constant of the dip cell was calibrated from the known conductivity of 0.01 M KCl at 25 °C. Cell preparation was done inside the argon-filled glove box, and the dip cell was sealed hermetically. Regarding the pure NaFSI, firstly a pellet was made by pressing the powder in a sealed KBr die under 3 tonnes of pressure. Then the sample was dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 hours. The dried pellet was placed between two stainless steel electrodes inside a lab-designed sealed barrel cell. The same analyser, frequency and temperature ranges were used for measuring the conductivity of pure NaFSI.
2.2.3.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX)
SEM images and EDX maps were used to characterize the microstructures and morphologies of pure OIPC and the 90 mol% NaFSI mixture. Experiments were carried out on a JEOL JSM IT 300 Series SEM at accelerating voltages of 5 and 2 kV, equipped with an Oxford X-Max 50 mm2 EDX detector. Samples were loaded onto carbon tape and sealed inside an Ar-filled canister in the glove box before being transferred to the SEM.
2.2.4.Symmetrical cell preparation
Microporous glass fiber separators (1.6 μm pore size and 260 μm thickness) were dried inside a vacuum oven at 100 °C overnight and then saturated with melted electrolyte. 9 mm diameter Na disc electrodes were punched out of Na metal (Sigma) that had been stored under paraffin oil (Merck Millipore), rolled and then mechanically cleaned in hexane using a brush. Symmetrical Na|Na CR2032 coin cells were prepared by assembling the Na discs and saturated separator in a Hohsen coin cell crimper, using a 0.5 mm spacer and a 1.4 mm spring. The whole cell assembly procedure was performed inside an argon-filled glove box. Cells were stored at 50 °C for 24 hours before being cycled on a Multi Potentiostat VMP3/Z (Bio-Logic) and data was collected using EC-lab software version 10.38.
Na symmetric cells containing either 90 mol% (an ultra-high concentration of NaFSI) or 60 mol% NaFSI in P1i444FSI were cycled at 0.05, 0.1 and 0.25 mA cm−2 current densities at 90 °C, 50 °C and room temperature. The cut off voltage was set at ±5 V.
