Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a facile method for the synthesis of a MoS2-doped Li2S–P2S5 glass-ceramic electrolyte (Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01). Noticeably, high ionic conductivity (4.8 mS cm−1 at room temperature) and good electrochemical stability are combined in this newly designed solid-state electrolyte. In view of these interesting characteristics, all-solid-state Li-S batteries with a Li7P2.9S10.85Mo0.01 electrolyte are demonstrated to have a higher capacity and a better cycling life than the counterpart with a Li7P3S11 electrolyte, due to their improved reaction kinetics with faster ion transfer and lower resistance. Our studies can provide valuable references for the synthesis of Li superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries.
