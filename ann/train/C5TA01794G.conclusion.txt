Conclusion
In summary, we have examined the effects of Ge substitution at Sn sites and of Ti substitution at Zr sites (varying Ti/Zr ratios) on the thermoelectric properties of TixZr1−xNiSn0.975Ge0.025 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.15 and 0.25) series of samples produced by induction melting and mechanical alloying. We found that increasing the Ti concentration above x = 0.15 led to a phase separation in the bulk TixZr1−xNiSn0.975Ge0.025 samples with the formation of Ti-rich inclusions embedded into the Zr-rich matrix. This combination of partial solid solution and phase separation in TixZr1−xNiSn0.975Ge0.025 resulted in a large reduction in the thermal conductivity. In addition, we observed an increase in the thermopower with increasing Ti concentration leading to an improvement in the power factor when compared to the sample with x = 0. The simultaneous increase in the power factor and large reduction in the thermal conductivity of TixZr1−xNiSn0.975Ge0.025 samples resulted in a large increase in the ZT with a maximum value of 0.48 observed at 775 K for Ti0.25Zr0.75NiSn0.975Ge0.025 composites. This work demonstrates that by manipulating the band gap of half-Heusler alloys through isoelectronic substitution at Ti/Zr and Sn/Ge sites, simultaneous enhancement of thermopower and reduction in thermal conductivity can be achieved leading to a significant increase in the ZT value.
