4.Conclusions
We have shown that simple chemical procedures can generate soft anhydrous solid acids of remarkably high proton conductivity, evidently due to the generation of rotator phases in which large globular anions are free to rotate on their lattice sites, allowing loosely bound protons to migrate freely through the disordered quasilattice. The one case that is truly liquid, (CH3)3SiHSO4, conducts less well than a number of related soft rotator phases. We note the existence of applications of very high proton conductivity in the natural world, but only demonstrate one case in our laboratory where rather good fuel cell characteristics are shown to be observable on the short term.
