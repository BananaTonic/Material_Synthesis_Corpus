Ammonium polyphosphate with crystalline form II was prepared as reported previously.12
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker-AXS D8 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 5° up to 120° with increments of 0.02°. Neutron powder diffraction (NPD) patterns were collected using the HRPT diffractometer of the SINQ spallation source (PSI, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland) with a wavelength of 1.494 Å at room temperature (RT), 100 and 200 °C. Both XRPD and NPD patterns were analysed by the Rietveld method using the FullProf program.13,14 The coherent scattering lengths of P, O, N and H were 5.13, 5.803, 9.36 and −3.739 fm, respectively.
For impedance spectra measurements, the obtained ammonium polyphosphate powder was pressed at 510 MPa into pellets. The pellets are 1 cm in diameter. The thickness of the pellets is in the range of 1–1.6 mm. Then the pellets were sputtered gold using a machine (Sputter Coater SCD 004, BALZERS). The gold-sputtered pellets were placed in a home-made four electrode apparatus and placed in a furnace for impedance measurements, which were performed with a Solartron 1260 Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer in combination with a 1286 Electrochemical Interface. The pellets were fixed between two platinum wire meshes. The frequency range is from 1 Hz to 1 MHz. The temperature was measured using a NiCr–Ni thermocouple type K in contact with the pellets. The measurement was carried out in humid air and hydrogen. The impedance spectra were recorded at constant temperatures after a 1 h equilibration time. The data were analyzed using ZView software (version 2.1).
