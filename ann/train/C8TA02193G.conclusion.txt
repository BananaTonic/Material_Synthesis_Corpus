Conclusions
In summary, a composite membrane, as a novel anion conductor, was prepared through controlled co-assembly of the exfoliated LDH nanosheets and QPVA via a facile filtration process. We demonstrated that the LDH laminates formed by the stacking of exfoliated LDH nanosheets mainly contributed to the conductive performance of the composite membranes. Within the intra-laminate galleries of LDH, hydroxyl slab surfaces and absorbed water molecules constructed extensive hydrogen bond networks for hydroxide ion transport. Moreover, the charge-balancing anions inside the intra-laminate channels greatly influenced the ion transport process. The proper selection of the anionic species rendered the superior conductivity of the LDH/QPVA membranes (130.3–172.1 mS cm−1 at 80 °C) owing to the large interlayer distance, high water uptake and weak electrostatic repulsion for hydroxide ion conduction. The organic moieties within the inter-laminate galleries of LDH reinforced the mechanical properties of the LDH/QPVA composites. Based on the interfacial interactions, the co-assembly of QPVA afforded a 1.1–1.9 times increase in mechanical strength and a 3.4–9.7 times increase in membrane toughness as compared to the LDH membrane. Accordingly, synergistic manipulation of the composition and interactions in the intra- and inter-laminate galleries of LDH resulted in highly conductive and robust anion conductors, which would become promising candidates for energy-related applications.
