Conclusions
In this work, the partial conductivities and mobilities of the charge carriers of BZCYYb1711 in the temperature range of 600–750 °C were successfully determined by a DC four-probe conductivity measurement. This proton conducting electrolyte may work as a dual ion-electron conductor under various gas conditions, which are closely similar to the O2 and H2 atmospheres on each side of the electrolyte, at high temperatures and low water vapor pressure. However, the computational analysis of the distributed chemical potential profile from partial conductivities indicates that BZCYYb1711 lies under the electrolyte domain for a PCFC, throughout the operating temperature range of 600–750 °C. The calculated theoretical peak power densities of BZCYYB1711 are 1.16, 2.64, and 5.28 W cm−2 at 30, 20, and 10 μm electrolyte thickness, respectively, at 600 °C. Additionally, our analysis shows that a fairly high fuel efficiency of about 95% could be achieved with potentials under 0.952 V. Moreover, the study proves the strong potential of BZCYYB1711 as a proton conducting electrolyte for intermediate temperature PCFCs.
