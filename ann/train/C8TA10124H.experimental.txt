2.Experimental section
2.1Synthesis of nanostructured UIO/Li-IL fillers
First, ZrCl4 and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) with a molar ratio of 1 : 1 were dissolved in 24.9 g N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) by magnetic stirring at room temperature; the obtained mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and placed in an oven at 120 °C for 24 h; after cooling to room temperature the resulting solid was centrifuged, washed with DMF and dried at 80 °C.24 The obtained UIO-66 nanocrystals were heated at 150 °C in a vacuum for 12 h to dismiss the absorbed DMF. To obtain a Li-containing ionic liquid, LiTFSI was dissolved in [EMIM][TFSI] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, Aladdin, 97%) at a concentration of 2 mol L−1, and the solution was heated at 120 °C in a vacuum for 12 h to dismiss trace H2O. Finally, the activated UIO-66 was mixed with Li-IL (3 : 4 in weight) and heated at 120 °C in a vacuum for 12 h to obtain UIO/Li-IL fillers.
2.2Synthesis of PEO-n-UIO electrolytes
PEO (Mw = 600 000) and LiTFSI were dissolved in 8 mL anhydrous acetonitrile under magnetic stirring at 60 °C. The molar ratio of EO : Li+ was kept at 18 : 1. Then nanostructured UIO/Li-IL fillers were added and sonicated to get a homogeneous solution. The weight percentages of UIO/Li-IL in the composite solid polymer electrolytes were designed to be 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Afterwards, the solution was cast on a polytetrafluoroethylene molder to volatilize the solvent at ambient temperature. Finally, the membranes were heated at 60 °C in a vacuum for 24 h to volatilize the residual solvent.
2.3Composition and structure characterization
An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Empyrean, PANalytical B.V. Corporation), a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Diamond DSC, PerkinElmer Instruments Corporation), a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI Corporation), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 F30, FEI Corporation) were used to study the crystalline phases, thermal behavior, morphology, microstructure and element distributions of the materials, respectively. DSC tests were performed in N2 gas at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. N2 gas adsorption isotherm analysis was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 porosimetry analyzer and the measurement was conducted at 77 K on UIO-66 samples before and after Li-IL impregnation.
2.4Property characterization
AC impedance measurements were undertaken at temperatures from 30 to 80 °C on symmetric cells with two stainless steel electrodes by means of a Solartron 1260 impedance analyzer in the frequency range of 1 to 5 × 106 Hz and at an amplitude of 50 mV. The sample was heated at desired temperatures for an hour before each measurement. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) behaviors of the electrolytes were tested using cells with a working electrode of stainless steel and a reference electrode of metallic Li by means of an electrochemical workstation in the voltage range of −1 to 5 V and at a scanning rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The transference number (t) of Li+ of the solid electrolytes was determined according to , where ΔV is the applied DC polarization voltage (0.01 V), I0 and I∞ are the initial and stable currents during polarization, and R0 and R∞ are the resistance of the solid electrolyte before and after polarization. Galvanostatic tests were conducted on symmetric cells with two metallic Li electrodes using a LANHE CT2001A charge/discharge system.
2.5Assembly and tests of solid-state lithium batteries
Carbon-coated LiFePO4 (Hefei Kejing Materials Technology Co.), UIO/Li-IL and Ketjen black powders were added to N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) subsequently in a weight ratio of 4 : 4 : 2 and stirred for 24 h to ensure homogeneous mixing. The obtained slurry was coated on stainless steel current collectors, and after solvent volatilization, the slurry was heated at 120 °C in a vacuum for 6 h. The weights of the active material in the electrodes were 1–2 mg. Solid-state lithium batteries were assembled using these cathodes, PEO-n-UIO solid electrolytes and a metallic Li anode in a Swagelok-type cell under a 10 N pressure. The internal resistances of the batteries were measured by AC impedance spectroscopy. Galvanostatic charge and discharge performances of solid-state batteries were investigated using a LANHE CT2001A charge/discharge system (Wuhan LAND Electronics Co.) in the potential range from 2.8 to 4 V at 60 °C.
