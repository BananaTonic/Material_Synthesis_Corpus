6Conclusions
In summary, we have characterized the temperature-dependent Li-ion conductivity of Li6Y(BO3)3 using an array of experimental and computational tools. While the ionic conductivity does not reach 2.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 until temperatures as high as 400 °C, the thermal and electrochemical stability of the pristine phase offers the promise of an exceptionally robust solid electrolyte if the ionic conductivity at room temperature can be enhanced. Defect formation energies and lithium-ion diffusion barriers calculated using density functional theory calculations support the model that in the pristine stoichiometric material lithium conductivity is limited by Frenkel pair formation, but that greatly improved ionic conductivities associated with activation energies as low as 0.20 eV could achieved through appropriate aliovalent chemical substitution to achieve Li-ion non-stoichiometry. Thus, proper modifications to the pristine Li6Y(BO3)3 should serve as a promising new platform for the development of high performance solid electrolytes.
