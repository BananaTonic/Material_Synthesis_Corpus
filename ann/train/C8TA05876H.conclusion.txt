Conclusions
CGMD simulation predicts that the D-SC and L-SC structures with QA decorated alkyl chains densely distributed along the backbone or the grafting chain have stronger phase aggregation potential compared with the typical mono SC structure. Inspired by the theoretical computational results, both the D-SC and L-SC structures were experimentally achieved by straightforward and simple chemistry using commercial paAE as a scaffold. The experimental characterization revealed that the D-SC structure shows a superior ability to improve the hydroxide conductivity of SC AEMs in contrast to the L-SC configuration. At 30 °C, the hydroxide conductivity of D-SC-paAE100% with an IEC of 2.41 mmol g−1 is even up to 0.058 S cm−1, which is significantly higher than that of most reported SC AEMs. The H2–O2 AEMFC using D-SC-paAE100% polymers as ionomers exhibits an exceptional peak power density of 683 mW cm−2 at 80 °C. Thus, a platform towards developing ideal AEMs with excellent comprehensive performance is established, where diverse backbones and alkaline head-groups can be combined to accelerate the commercial process of AEMs.
