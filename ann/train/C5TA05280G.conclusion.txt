Conclusions
The framework of the NdMo-MOF [Nd(mpca)2Nd(H2O)6Mo(CN)8]·6H2O features octagonal hydrophilic channels that make it one of the best proton-conducting MOFs. These channels contain two “types” of water molecules: coordinated (‘in-the-framework’) water and lattice (absorbed) water. Our studies show that it is the lattice water which are responsible for the proton conductivity. The lattice water molecules form a hydrogen-bonding network, through which protons “hop” along via the Grotthuss mechanism. The fact that (unlike most MOFs) this material is also stable both in water and at relatively high temperatures (up to 150 °C) makes it a promising candidate for real-life applications. As we showed earlier, this class of materials has also special luminescence and magnetic properties.41,42 Combining these with ionic conductivity opens opportunities for designing proton-conducting switches controlled by temperature, light and/or external magnetic fields.40
