Results and discussion
In the present investigation, employing a mutually exclusive reaction strategy, lithiated poly(3-sulfopropyl methacrylate) is synthesized via free-radical polymerization and interpenetrated into a growing polyether-polyurethane network to achieve free standing films. The semi-IPN matrix primarily involves a polyethylene oxide based system as a major component both for the primary networks and secondary entanglements. Comprehensive studies on polyether-polyurethane networks is now well established by our group33,34,48–51 and hence provides an appropriate control for validation of these complex polymeric systems (see the ESI). Concurrently, the alternate monomer of choice, 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SPM−·K+) and/or similar monomers, has also been extensively studied for synthesizing a wide variety of polymeric architectures including the design of ‘polymeric ionic liquids’.1–6,52,53 Of them only few documents use similar monomers as a possible single ion conductor.1,6 Nonetheless, the ionic conductivities reported are relatively low particularly owing to their higher glass transition temperatures and degree of crystallinity. Attempts made to enhance ionic conductivity by blending or copolymerization with polyethers met with limited success.14,17,18,22–32 To the best of our knowledge, exploring a semi-IPN approach to successfully tailor the single-ion conduction in such systems is hitherto undocumented.
Physicochemical properties
Lithiation of 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate (SPM−·Li+) enhances its solubility considerably, offering ease of polymerization. Confirmation on the formation of the homopolymer, P(SPM−·Li+), both in isolation and within the semi-IPN matrix was assessed using 1H, 13C-NMR, FTIR, ESI-MS and MALDI-TOF (see the ESI). The anionic homopolymer entrapped within the semi-IPN networks was isolated by repeated Soxhlet extraction for structural elucidation. The absence of the peaks at δ = 6.2 and 5.7 corresponding to the methylene protons (double bond, CC) of the monomer confirms successful polymerization (Fig. SI-7(a)). The average molecular weight of P(SPM−·Li+) synthesized and incorporated within the network as assessed by MALDI-TOF post-extraction from the cast film, Fig. SI-7(b), is ca. 1800 Daltons.
The polymer–polymer and ion–polymer interactions were quite evident from the mid-FTIR studies (Fig. SI-9(A) and (B)). With progressive increase in the secondary component, P(SPM−·Li+), for binary and ternary semi-IPN compositions significant changes in the zones of interests are observed (see the ESI).18,53–55 The fact that the interactions occurring between polyether chain segments in the network and the incorporated anionic homopolymer (polymer–polymer) is appreciable is indicated by the significantly suppressed peaks at ca. 946 cm−1 and 844 cm−1 (Fig. SI-9A(b)–(f)) for the binary compositions.56,57 These two characteristic peaks are attributed to r(CH2)s observed in polyethers.57,58 Earlier reports have suggested that the presence of these peaks indicate preferential gauche confirmation of the –CH2–CH2– units necessary to attain helical conformation of the PEO chains.57 The anionic homopolymer incorporated within the PEG-PU matrix evidently restricts the PEO chains from attaining the helical confirmations. The competitive interactions introduced with the incorporation of PEGDME as the ternary component in the matrix are perceptible (Fig. SI-9B:(a)–(f)), with the strong reappearance of peaks at ca. 946 cm−1 and 844 cm−1. The formation of helical conformations implies preferential domains of PEG-PU/PEGDME coexisting in the matrix and asserts change in ion solvation dynamics. Additionally, the prominently broad C–O–C regions suggest very favourable ionic interactions and improved ion dissociation that provides crucial clues in understanding the ion-transport behaviour in these binary and ternary matrices.
Fig. 1 represents a ternary phase diagram projected for the binary and ternary compositions of the synthesized semi-IPNs comprising of polyethylene glycol-polyurethane (PEG-PU) networks, poly(3-sulfopropyl methacrylate) lithium salt, P(SPM−·Li+) and oligomeric polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME) as the three constituents. As observed, the binary compositions comprising PEG-PU/PEGDME, an oligomeric content in excess of 75 weight% resulted in a solid–liquid phase separated viscous mix.33 PEGDME : P(SPM−·Li+) binary compositions remain as viscous homogeneous suspensions for P(SPM−·Li+) content &lt;40 wt%, while higher concentrations of P(SPM−·Li+) display tendencies of salting out. For the binary semi-IPN compositions of PEG-PU : P(SPM−·Li+), incorporation of P(SPM−·Li+) over ca. 60 weight% resulted in noticeable solid–solid phase segregation and poor film formation. Phase separations in ternary compositions were also quite apparent in the periphery of these binary boundary conditions (yellow shaded region). Inclusion of either PEGDME or P(SPM−·Li+) &gt; 20 weight% as component-III severely compromised the homogeneity of phase and film forming capabilities. These phase separated and/or dimensionally unstable compositions are excluded in this study. Intermediary compositions comprising both binary and ternary components show excellent phase homogeneity, form free-standing films and were comprehensively assessed for their physicochemical and electrochemical properties. The highlighted zone of optimum composition was arrived at following these detailed evaluations as explained in the successive sections.

The zone of optimum ternary compositions highlighted is the area of primary interest in the present discussion. Data for binary semi-IPN constituents PEG-PU/PEGDME are reproduced from Bar et al.33
The morphology of the synthesized ternary semi-IPN films after curing was studied by employing field emission scanning electron microscopy on a JEOL FESEM, Model 7610F. The Pt-sputtered (fine coated) specimens were mounted in horizontal and lateral positions to study the surface topography as well as the fractured cross-sections for evaluating homogeneity. The top and the bottom surfaces of the synthesized films were essentially featureless with relatively smooth surfaces interspersed with wrinkles, Fig. 2(a) and (d). Cross-sectional views, nevertheless, revealed some interesting information as evident from the series of electron micrographs provided in Fig. 2(b), (c), (e), and (f). The magnified images display a rough and textured morphology typical of the polyurethanes. Notably the two compositions when compared, the 100 : 0 films evidently show a much denser and relatively more uniform bulk (Fig. 2(a)–(c)). The absence of polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME) possibly contributes to such a dense morphology. The higher intra-/inter-chain entanglements (plasticization) likely to occur for the semi-IPN matrices with increased presence of the oligomeric PEGDME probably leads to the formation of random domain-like features perceptible in the matrix (Fig. 2(d)–(f)). The characteristic of the (70 : 30) compositions evidently puts forth an impression of a considerably flexible and softer matrix with no apparent phase separation noticeable. In contrary, blends of P(SPM−·Li+) incorporated polymer matrices show phase separation (see the ESI, Fig. SI-10). Polymer electrolyte compositions beyond (20 : 80) visibly lacked structural integrity and phase homogeneity. Overall, the synthesized ternary semi-IPN compositions display appreciable phase homogeneity for the composition ranges under study.

It is now well understood that ionic hopping during charge transport is assisted by segmental motions.9,59–62 An amorphous bulk coupled with low glass transition temperature can significantly aid ion conduction in macromolecular matrices. The thermal properties of the synthesized semi-IPNs were hence comprehensively assessed employing differential scanning calorimetry. As depicted in Fig. SI-11(A)(a), the macromonomer, PEG-4000, possesses &gt;90% crystallinity with a melting temperature of ca. 63 °C. Owing to its high degree of crystallinity the glass transition temperature remains indeterminate. PEGDME, Mw = 500 when analyzed reveals a broad Tm at ca. 5–6 °C, Fig. SI-11(A)(b). Nevertheless, when crosslinked with castor-oil and 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate to form the parent polyether-polyurethane networks the crystallinity of the polyethylene glycol is evidently completely arrested, Fig. SI-11(A)(c). A complete disappearance of the melting peak (Tm) is observed and the Tg of the system remains considerably low (∼−65 °C) with a broad transition characteristic of an entangled network. For a PEG-PU/PEGDME semi-IPN, the reappearance of melting peaks corresponding to ether rich crystalline domains signifies a preferential interaction between the crosslinked PEG units and the oligomeric PEGDME incorporated, Fig. SI-11(A)(d). The multiple shoulders observed in the melting region are quite significant and indicate not only the inherent polydispersity present in the system but also the inter-/intra-molecular interactions primarily due to H-bonding.33,34 Fig. SI-11(B)(c) is a representative thermogram of the pure lithiated poly(sulfopropyl methacrylate) homopolymer, P(SPM−·Li+) synthesized. The rigid and brittle character of the anionic polymer is quite noticeable with its glass transition (Tg ∼ 70 °C) displayed above the ambient temperature and a considerably prominent melting (endothermic peak) at ca. 173 °C. The fact that the same polymer when incorporated into a semi-IPN matrix can perceptibly alter its nature is evinced in the thermograms of binary compositions presented in Fig. SI-11(B)(d)–(h). A series of binary compositions with increasing weight ratio of P(SPM−·Li+) in the parent network (PEG-PU) synthesized showcase the effect of entanglements. The absence of a melting peak corresponding to the P(SPM−·Li+) component and considerably subdued melting for that of polyethylene glycol chains indicates significant inter-/intra-molecular interactions within the matrix bulk.33,34 With increase in the secondary constituent only a minimal shift of Tg for the polyurethane network is observed.
The thermograms of ternary semi-IPN compositions with increasing polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME) as component-III are provided in Fig. 3(a)–(f). The reappearance of the melting peak corresponding to ether rich crystalline domains signifies a preferential interaction between the crosslinked PEG units and the incorporated oligomeric PEGDME. A progressive change in the degree of crystallinity and melting profiles is also quite noticeable in the temperature range −10 °C to 60 °C. The broad single peak observed for the ratio 70 : 30 PEG-PU : PEGDME at ∼49 °C, indicates a intermolecular H-bonding interaction. With an increase in PEGDME loading the highlighted temperature region slowly evolves revealing multiple peaks owing to assorted inter-/intra-molecular H-bonding and inherent polydispersity (Table 1). As observed for composition with higher PEGDME loading, the appearance of melting peaks (Tm) at ca. 5–6 °C indicates the presence of exclusive PEGDME domains in the networks. It should be noted, that the P(SPM−·Li+) concentration in these ternary systems was maintained so as to achieve an overall EO/Li mole ratio = 25 (i.e. ∼25 EO units per Li+-ion considering both PEG and PEGDME). Hence, an increase in PEGDME wt% also logically implies an increase in the total P(SPM−·Li+) content in the bulk. The shift in glass transition temperature observed in this series thus apparently varied with the composition at random. It can be rationalized as a trade-off to balance the plasticizing effect of oligomeric PEGDME and the obvious increase of transient crosslinks owing to added lithiation. This proposition draws additional support when the thermal behavior of the PEG-PU : PEGDME/P(SPM−·Li+) ternary systems is evaluated as a function of increasing P(SPM−·Li+) content while holding the PEG-PU : PEGDME ratio constant at 30 : 70, Fig. 3(a)–(g). Interestingly, the multiple splitting already observed in the melting region most likely owing to inter-/intra-molecular H-bonds of networked PEG and PEGDME gets pronounced indicating an undeniable effect of P(SPM−·Li+) participating in these interactions. Considering favorable ion-dissociation, the anionic grafts on the polymer P(SPM−·Li+) possibly are excellent sites promoting H-bond interactions. Nevertheless, the glass transition temperatures estimated and overall matrix crystallinity indicated an impressively plasticized and significantly amorphous semi-IPN matrix conducive to ionic transport (Table 1). The thermal stabilities of the synthesized ternary semi-IPNs are also assessed using thermogravimetry with a thermal degradation onset (To) of ca. 250 °C (Fig. SI-12 and Table 1).

(B) Typical DSC stack plots of the synthesized semi-IPN matrices of PEG-PU : PEGDME (30 : 70) with variation of P(SPM−·Li+) concentration in the system such that the effective EO/Li+ mole ratio achieved are (a) 70; (b) 50; (c) 30; (d) 25; (e) 20; (f) 15; and (g) 10. Multiple splitting observed in the melting region is quite significant and indicates that the inherent polydispersity present in the system (i.e. for PEG macromonomer and the oligomer PEGDME used) gets more pronounced owing to progressive increase in interactions with the anionic polymer P(SPM−·Li+).

Temperature-step impedance spectroscopy was employed to estimate the bulk resistance and study the ion conduction behavior of these semi-IPN compositions. The real impedance observed was appropriately normalized for cell dimensions to determine the specific conductivity (σ S cm−1) and an average of at least three samples (N = 3, mean ± SD) is represented in the plots. Initial evaluation of ionic conductivity for the binary compositions, PEG-PU networks + P(SPM−·Li+), are provided in Fig. SI-13 (see the ESI). As represented in the plot, the P(SPM−·Li+) content was varied in a way so that the mole ratio of ethylene oxide content to the Li+ ions achieved in the matrix is 25, 20, 11, 7 and 5, respectively. It is to be noted, as the EO/Li+ ratio decrease, the loading of P(SPM−·Li+) in the bulk increases considerably. To specify, the corresponding PEG-PU : P(SPM−·Li+) weight ratios are approximately 80 : 20; 70 : 30; 60 : 40; 50 : 50 and 40 : 60, respectively. The compositions incorporating beyond 60 wt% of the synthesized anionic polymers were very brittle, visibly lacked phase homogeneity (Fig. 1) and were not considered for further evaluations. In the typical Arrhenius plot, Fig. SI-13, non-linearity is observed at temperatures above 50 °C characteristic of Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (V–T–F) plots,9,10,33 where predominant polymeric segmental motions are understood to play a key role in assisting ionic hopping events. Semi-IPN compositions with 20 wt% loading of P(SPM−·Li+) (EO/Li = 25) displayed the best ionic conductivity profile with σ in the range of 10−7–10−5 S cm−1 within the temperature window of study.
In contrary, the anionic homopolymers P(SPM·K+) and P(SPM·Li+) both show significantly low ionic conductivities (∼10−8–10 −7 S cm−1) (Fig. SI-14). Binary blends of PEG-PU/P(SPM·Li+) with 50 : 50 wt% compositions shows a slight improvement in the conductivity profile. Pure PEG, Mw = 4000 blended with pre-synthesized P(SPM·Li+) in similar weight ratios when analyzed reveal comparable conductivities in the temperature range 25–40 °C. A jump in ionic conduction is seen at around 60 °C, which is associated with the melting of PEG along with subsequent loss of dimensional stability of the electrolytes. One of our primary objectives to employ interpenetrating motif is to enhance the dimensional stability of conventional PEG-based electrolyte systems. The blends (ex situ) and semi-IPN samples (in situ) when compared show almost similar conductivity ranges with the semi-IPNs providing a slight edge at lower temperatures owing to better phase homogeneity achieved. This particularly highlights the advantages offered by the interpenetrating polymer networks approach adopted. Apart from providing dimensional stability to the matrix, phase separation and crystallization is effectively restricted owing to inherent entanglements of the networks and linear polymers in situ that tenders unique characteristics. In particular, proper control on the gelation time can impede/arrest phase separation of otherwise immiscible systems. Solution blends on the contrary tend to yield unwanted phase separation that adversely affects the ionic conductivity. The considerably low glass transition temperature coupled with an apparently amorphous matrix of the semi-IPNs supports the observation. Retaining the optimum composition of the PEG-PU/P(SPM−·Li+) binary system, further efforts were directed to push the limits of ionic conductivity in the desirable electrochemical operational range of ∼10−4 S cm−1.
In this attempt, ternary semi-IPN systems were synthesized by simultaneous incorporation of oligomeric polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether as component-III. In a logical follow-through of the preceding evaluations with binary systems, the ternary compositions were synthesized so as to maintain a total EO/Li ratio of 25 with respect to P(SPM−·Li+). Fig. 4(a) provides a cartoon representation of the possible micro-phases that can probably coexist within the matrix bulk. The plasticized networked phase is denoted as binary phase (phase-I), the predominantly oligomeric (PEGDME) phase solvating the PSPM−·Li+ is denoted as an alternate binary phase (phase-II) and the intimately mixed ternary phase is denoted as phase-III. An equivalent circuit comprising a combination of distributed elements of resistors (Ri) and constant phase elements (Qi) in parallel can effectively represent the individual phases. For symmetrical cells with blocking electrodes, at the electrode–electrolyte interface an additional contribution of semi-infinite/bound Warburg impedance (Wo) is evident at low frequency region. As exemplified by the typical Nyquist plots, the goodness of the fits (solid red lines) to the experimental data over a wide temperature window validates the proposed physical model. Fig. 4(b) and (c), depicts the conductivity plots (log σ vs. 1000/T) for the ternary compositions estimated from Rb, the real part of impedance, determined post fitting. The PEGDME content in the system was progressively increased and the weight ratio of PEG-PU : PEGDME is provided as 100 : 0; 90 : 10; 80 : 20; 70 : 30; 60 : 40; 50 : 50; 40 : 60 and 30 : 70. Compositions beyond 70 wt% PEGDME do not gel to yield free standing films (liquid-like, Fig. 1) and hence not considered for evaluations. All the compositions show an Arrhenius to V–T–F transition invariably at ∼50 °C. This clearly suggests the initiation of an additional role played by melting of crystalline domains and draws support from the DSC studies. As anticipated, the ternary composition with PEGDME 70 wt% displays the highest bulk conductivity. Interestingly, incorporation of low molecular weight methoxy capped polyethylene glycols (Fig. SI-15) not only imparts plasticization to improve ionic mobility but also considerably alters the intermolecular interactions. Crucial clues that implies strong inter-/intra-molecular interactions involving the anionic polymer, P(SPM−·Li+) are in play, as was amply evident from the thermograms. To zero in on the optimum ternary composition, the content of P(SPM−·Li+) was further varied as a function of the EO/Li ratio while maintaining the PEG-PU : PEGDME weight ratio at 30 : 70. In contrary to our expectation, the change in P(SPM−·Li+) content exhibited a trend almost similar to conventional salts solvated in polymeric matrices.32,59–62 The presence of at least 10–25 free ethylene oxide (EO) units promotes faster ionic conduction (Table 2). The observation implies that the transport of Li+-ion in these semi-IPNs is preferably mediated by the –C–O–C– cage (see the ESI) and not exclusively by either ion hopping or the Grotthuss mechanism as seen before.

After assembly in a glove box all the cells were allowed to stabilize for at least 24 h prior to the evaluations. In a typical anodic sweep with a slew rate of 10 mV s−1, an onset of an irreversible oxidation was observed beyond V &gt; 4.7 V for the samples under study (Fig. 5(a)). Interestingly, increase of the PEGDME content does not seem to adversely affect the electrolyte stability. The cationic transport number was estimated by a combination of dc- and ac- methods following the protocol described by Evans et al.45–47 As depicted in Fig. 5(b) chronoamperometry was carried out at three different potentials, 10 mV, 100 mV and 1 V to ascertain the response of the electrolytes under applied bias. Impedance measurements were carried out before and after the polarization studies to estimate the initial and steady state resistance of the electrode–electrolyte interface. In a slight modification to Evans' approach, as extended by Abraham et al.;46 the initial and steady state resistance of the polymer electrolytes under study were also considered. Estimation of transport number employing both the approaches yielded similar results for the systems. An average tLi+ was determined to be ∼0.87 at 26 °C for the PEG-PU : PEGDME/P(SPM−·Li+) system (30 : 70; EO/Li+ = 25) which is appreciably high. Noticeably, experiments conducted at elevated temperatures i.e. 60 °C, as exemplified in the figure, the tcationic was observed to drop considerably (tLi+ ∼ 0.71). This observation at higher temperatures can be rationalized taking into account the increased participation of segmental motions. The thermally activated internal Brownian motions (IBM) of the chain segments possibly allows the entrapped polyanions to reorganize (ion-cages) within the semi-IPN matrix and contributes to an overall charge transport by assisting ionic hopping events.

The P(SPM−·Li+) concentration in semi-IPN matrices of PEG-PU : PEGDME/P(SPM−·Li+) synthesized with a varying weight % of PEGDME was maintained at EO/Li mole ratio = 25. The anodic stability of the polymer electrolyte compositions is ∼4.7 V as depicted by the dotted line.

Exemplified here is a semi-IPN composition of 30–70 incorporating P(SPM−·Li+); EO/Li ratio = 25 sandwiched between two ion transparent lithium electrodes.

Assessing electrolyte feasibility in LiFeO4 battery applications
Recent excitement around LiFePO4 as an attractive cathode material in rechargeable Li-ion batteries is because of its low cost, non-toxicity, abundance of iron, thermal stability and safety apart from its appreciably high specific capacity (170 mA h g−1). Since, the first report by Goodenough et al.,35,36 the performance of Li/LiFePO4 cells with liquid electrolytes,40 ionic liquids41 and/or polymer electrolytes41,42 has been reported. A preliminary study on the LiFePO4/Li system is hence undertaken to assess the feasibility and showcase the viability of these new class of single-ion conducting quasi-solid electrolytes.
The preparation of the composite LiFePO4 cathode using commercial LiFePO4 was undertaken by following a conventional method. A paste comprising LiFePO4, Super P® conducting carbon and a PVdF binder in 70 : 20 : 10 weight percent was cast onto a sanded aluminium foil and vacuum dried. The coated aluminium foils were mechanically punched to obtain uniform LiFePO4 cathodes, which were vacuum dried and transferred into the glove box for cell assembly. Test cells of LiFePO4/Li with a PEG-PU : PEGDME/P(SPM−·Li+) (30 : 70; EO/Li+ = 25) quasi-solid electrolyte system sandwiched in between were fabricated as detailed in the Experimental section and the schematic representation of a full-cell configuration is illustrated in Fig. 6. Sun et al.63 have highlighted the importance of using a liquid electrolyte saturated Celgard between the solid electrolyte and the electrodes to provide a soft contact at the interface. The trilayer separator is also known to restrict the probability of dendritic shorts when Li-metal is used as the anode. Celgard 2320 films were hence introduced as an interfacial layer between the LiFePO4-cathode and the PEG-PU : PEGDME/P(SPM−·Li+) as well as the Li-anode and the quasi-solid electrolyte. Both the interlayers were soaked with approximately 25 μL 1 M LiTFSI/PEGDME 250 liquid electrolyte to reduce the interfacial resistance. Post sealing and stabilization inside the argon glove box electrochemical performance evaluations were carried out on the test cells. All the test cells post-assembly displayed a remarkably stable OCV in the range of 3.2–3.3 V implying the success of the fabrication protocol adopted and absence of unwarranted self-discharge or chemical shorts.

Optical photographs of the punched disks for the active components are displayed in true colours. Electrochemical performance evaluation of the assembled test cells: Representative plots of (a) cyclic voltammetry scans depicting the reduction and oxidation occurring at the working cathode obtained at various slew rates (0.1–1.0 mV s−1). (b) Typical voltage profiles as a function of specific capacity (mA h g−1 of LiFePO4) obtained for charge and discharge cycles in the potential range 4.2 V &gt; V &gt; 2 V under different C-rates (0.05C, 0.1C and 0.2C) at T = 25 °C. (c) Cycling performance of the test cell over ∼100 cycles at different C-rates. (d) Variation of specific charge–discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency of the test cells observed over 100 cycles.
Fig. 6(a) presents typical cyclic voltammograms of a LiFePO4/PEG-PU : PEGDME/P(SPM−·Li+)/Li device within the potential window 2.0–4.6 V, acquired at a variable slew rate (0.1–1.0 mV s−1). A distinct pair of redox peak is visible for the slower scan rates, which is typical of a two phase system and corresponds to the Fe3+/Fe2+ couple.44,64 The appreciably reversible nature of this phase transformation is also apparent from the symmetry of CV plots. However, unlike observed for purely liquid electrolyte based systems, with increase in slew rates the peaks are observed to shift towards the edge of the potential window and finally seems to disappear. The observation indicates the relatively slower redox kinetics in these macromolecular systems.
The voltage profiles as a function of specific capacity (mA h g−1 – LiFePO4) for the charge and discharge cycles of a typical cell at different C-rates are presented as Fig. 6(b). At 0.05C, a dominant voltage plateau is clearly noticeable in the range of 3.5–3.6 V while charging and 3.3–3.2 V during discharge. An impressive reversible specific capacity ca. 150 mA h g−1 is also observed. Changing the C-rates to 0.1C and 0.2C, both the working voltage (3.15 V and 2.8 V, respectively) as well as the capacity (∼115 mA h g−1 and 110 mA h g−1, respectively) is seen to slightly reduce. Interestingly, when the C-rates are reversed, the test-cells seem to regain the lost capacities and match the 0.05C rates. The columbic efficiency Fig. 6(d) estimated over the cycle life of the cells are observed to be in the range of 94–98%. A comparative analysis of the performance for single-ion conducting polymers reported in the literature has been summarized in Table 3. In a recent study, Armand et al.,12 have reported on a BAB triblock copolymer of poly(styrene trifluoromethane sulphonylimide lithium salt) P(STFSILi) with poly(ethylene oxide). They report the feasibility of the polymer in LiFePO4/Li cells tested at elevated temperatures of 60 °C owing to significantly lower conductivities of their copolymers (∼10−7 S cm−1 at 45 °C). The preliminary attempts in the present study on the electrolyte feasibility in the LiFePO4/Li cells at ca. 25 °C are hence certainly encouraging to advance our studies further.
