Conclusions
Experimental work has been carried out to follow up our recent theoretical prediction that superb ionic conductivity could be achieved in the cubic argyrodite Li6PS5Cl, through tuning of its lattice chemistry. Significant enhancement of the ionic conductivity has been achieved by either (a) slight off-stoichiometric shift with excess Li while maintaining overall charge balance between anions and cations; or more effectively, (b) replacement of the S lattice sites with Te, with lower electronegativity. Remarkable enhancement of ionic conductivity has been achieved through the combined effect, so that superb Li+ conductivity has been achieved in Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75, being 4.5 mS cm−1 at 25 °C and 1.6 mS cm−1 at −20 °C.
Replacement of S with Te leads to weaker bonding, an enlarged unit cell, and a softer lattice. This makes it easier for the inter-octahedral transport of Li+, which dictates its long-distance diffusion.
This new class of solid electrolyte based on cubic chalcogenide is electrochemically compatible with a Li anode over a large potential window up to 7 V. This makes it highly attractive to enable high capacity all-solid lithium ion batteries, using environmentally friendly resources.
