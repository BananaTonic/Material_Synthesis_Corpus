Experimental
Materials
1,6-Dibromohexane (98%, Aladdin, China), 1-methylimidazole (99%, Aladdin, China), methoxyhydroquinone (MHQ) (98%, J&amp;K, China), 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphenol (BPHF) (99%, Matrix, USA), bis(4-fluorophenyl) sulfone (FPS) (99.0%, TCI, Japan), boron tribromide (BBr3) (99.9%, Aladdin, China), and potassium iodide (99.5%, Aladdin, China) were used as received. Toluene (98.0%, Sinopharm, China) was stirred over CaH2 for 24 h, then distilled under reduced pressure and stored over 4 Å molecular sieves. Acetone, chloroform (CHCl3), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and all other chemicals were supplied by Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China) and used without further purification.
Preparation of AEMs
Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of 1-(6-bromohexyl)-3-methylimidazolium bromide (6BrIm), a kind of imidazolium-based ionic liquid (IL). An excess of 1,6-dibromohexane was fed to reduce the yield of the bis-substituted by-product. The procedure for the preparation of the AEMs is shown in Scheme 2. The precursor poly(ether sulfone)s containing methoxy groups (MPES-x) were synthesized via nucleophilic substitution polycondensation, followed by demethylation to yield hydroxyl-bearing poly(ether sulfone)s (HPES-x). The bromine-bearing ILs can react with HPES-x in the presence of potassium carbonate to generate imidazolium poly(ether sulfone)s (ImPES-x).

Synthesis of 6BrIm
6BrIm was synthesized according to a reported procedure with some modifications.29 A mixture of 1-methylimidazole (4 mL, 4.12 g, 50 mmol) and acetone (50 mL) was placed into a 250 mL three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a condenser, a nitrogen inlet and outlet, and then 1,6-dibromohexane (30 mL, 48 g, 194 mmol) was added into the flask at room temperature (RT). The mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 15 h to give a white suspension, followed by filtration to remove the white solid bis-substituted by-product. The by-product was further drained with acetone for the recovery of 6BrIm to achieve a maximum yield. The filtrate was rotor-evaporated to obtain a viscous pale yellow oil product by removing the acetone. The resulting product was extracted with ethyl acetate and diethyl ether several times, and dried at 50 °C under vacuum for 24 h (yield: 75%).
Synthesis of MPES-x
Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of the precursor MPES-x (where x is the molar ratio of MHQ to FPS) by the nucleophilic substitution polycondensation of the as-synthesized copolymers. A typical procedure for the synthesis of MPES-0.7 is detailed as follows: FPS (10 mmol, 2.5425 g), BPAF (3 mmol, 1.0087 g), MHQ (7 mmol, 0.9810 g), K2CO3 (20 mmol, 2.76 g), DMAc (30 mL), and toluene (15 mL) were placed into a 100 mL three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a Dean–Stark trap, and a gas inlet and outlet. The reaction mixture was heated to 140 °C to remove the azeotrope of water/toluene out of the reaction system. After 4 h, the mixture was slowly heated to 155 °C and then stirred for 15 h. Before the end of the reaction, MHQ (0.5 mmol, 0.0710 g) was added to the reaction mixture and then the reaction was continued for another 1 h. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to RT and poured into 400 mL of an aqueous methanol solution under vigorous stirring (methanol/deionized (DI) water = 1/1, v/v) to yield a white solid precipitate. The product was washed with water and methanol several times and dried at 80 °C under vacuum for 24 h.
Synthesis of HPES-x
A typical procedure is given as follows: 2.7 g of MPES-0.7 was dissolved into 30 mL of CHCl3 to make a solution in a 100 mL three-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet and a mechanical stirrer. BBr3 (3 mL) was mixed with CHCl3 (10 mL), and then added dropwise to the MPES-0.7 solution at 0 °C to initiate the reaction. After 6 h, the resulting powder (HPES-0.7) was filtered, washed with CHCl3 and water several times and dried at 60 °C for 24 h.
Synthesis of ImPES-x
HPES-0.7 (2.0 g), K2CO3 (1.38 g, 10 mmol), KI (0.083 g, 0.5 mmol), and DMSO (30 mL) were mixed in a 100 mL three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, and a nitrogen inlet and outlet. The mixture was then heated to 100 °C to dissolve HPES-0.7 completely. 6BrIm (2.6320 g, 8 mmol) was added to the mixture and stirred at 100 °C for 12 h. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to RT and poured into 200 mL of acetone to form a taupe solid precipitate (ImPES-0.7), then washed with acetone and DI water several times.
Membrane fabrication and alkalization
ImPES-x was dissolved in DMSO (3% w/v), followed by filtration through a 0.45 μm PTFE syringe filter to obtain a transparent yellowish-brown solution. The resulting solution was cast onto a clean glass plate, followed by drying at 60 °C under vacuum for 24 h to form a film. The obtained film was peeled off and then soaked in a 1.0 M aqueous potassium hydroxide solution at RT for 48 h, followed by washing with DI water several times and immersing in DI water at least for 48 h before evaluation.
Structure characterization
1H NMR spectra were recorded on an Avance II 500 MHz (Bruker, Switzerland) using dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the standard. The mechanical properties of the membranes (OH− type) were measured using a universal tester (WDW-1E Testing System) with a crosshead speed of 5 mm min−1 at RT. The thermal stability was evaluated on a thermogravimetric analyzer (SDT-Q600, TA, USA) from RT to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. A field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss Sigma, Germany) was used to characterize the morphology of the membranes. The surface micrograph of the AEMs was observed via an atomic force microscope (5500, Agilent Technologies). Tapping mode was used in the observation under ambient conditions (25 °C, 60% relative humidity (RH)). Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) profiles of the AEMs were recorded using a SAXSess-MC2 X-ray scattering spectrometer (Anton Paar, Austria) at RT.
Characterization of AEMs
Ionic conductivity
The resistance (R) of the membrane samples (OH− type) was measured over the frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz by the two-electrode AC impedance spectroscopy method using a Parstat 263 electrochemical workstation (Princeton Advanced Technology, USA). All of the samples were tested in a N2-protected chamber with DI water. The ionic conductivity, σ (S cm−1), is calculated as follows:1where l (cm) is the distance between the two copper electrodes, and A (cm2) is the cross-sectional area of the tested membrane.
Water uptake (WU)
The WU was examined using a quartz spring balance as previously reported.30 The WU of the membrane (OH− type) can be calculated by Hooke's law:2where k is the elasticity coefficient of the quartz spring, and L1, L2 and L3 are the lengths of the quartz spring without loading, and when loaded with the dry and the wet membranes, respectively.
Swelling ratio (SR)
The change in the length of the membrane (OH− type) before and after being immersed in water at a given temperature for 24 h can be used to estimate the SR of the membrane:3where Ld and Wd are the length and the width of the dry membrane, respectively, and Lw and Ww are the length and the width of the wet membrane, respectively.
Ion exchange capacity (IEC)
The weight-based IEC (IECw, meq. g−1) is calculated by4where x is the molar ratio of MHQ to FPS, and Wx (525.64 g mol−1) and W1−x (550.47 g mol−1) are the molecular weights of the ionized repeating unit (OH− type) and the unionized repeating unit, respectively.
IECw is measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy and the standard back-titration method as reported previously.31
The volume-based IEC value (IECv, meq. cm−3) can be calculated by5where ρ (g cm−3) is the density of the membrane, and IECv,dry and IECv,wet are the IECv of the dry and the wet membranes, respectively.
Alkaline stability
The alkaline stability of the AEMs was evaluated by monitoring the variation of IEC and conductivity after the membrane was immersed in a 2 M KOH solution at 60 and 80 °C for different times from 24 to 504 h.
Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and single cell performance
The carbon paper loaded with 1 mg cm−2 Pt (Johnson Matthey) was used for the anode and cathode electrodes. The electrodes were painted with an ImPES-0.85 solution (5% w/v, DMSO), and the ImPES-0.85 membrane was then sandwiched between the two electrodes with the catalyst layer facing the membrane, followed by hot-pressing at 70 °C for 2 min. The feed of H2 on the anode and O2 on the cathode was at the rate of 50 and 100 mL·min−1, respectively. Single cell performance was evaluated at 60 °C with a RH of 100% using an electronic load (ZY8714, ZHONGYING Electronic Co., Ltd).
