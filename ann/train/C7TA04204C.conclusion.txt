Conclusions
In summary, a new class of polymeric ionic liquid (PIL)–organic ionic plastic crystal all-solid-state polymer electrolytes (PIL–P12FSI–LiTFSI SPEs) has been successfully discovered by incorporating N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (P12FSI) as a desirable ionic plastic crystal in the pyrrolidinium-based PIL/LiTFSI solid system. The as-obtained SPEs provide flexible mechanical character, high thermal and electrochemical stability, desirable room temperature ionic conductivity, and good interfacial stability with lithium metal. In particular, the Li/LiFePO4 cells using the [50/50]/20 SPE can achieve stable discharge capacities of about 150 mA h g−1, 155 mA h g−1, and 165 mA h g−1 at 0.2C rate at 25 °C, 40 °C, and 80 °C, respectively, and show excellent cycling performance. Furthermore, good rate performance can be realized. Such favorable results make the as-prepared SPE system a promising candidate for future LMBs with a broad operating temperature range.
