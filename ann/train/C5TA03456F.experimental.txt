2.Experimental
2.1.Materials and treatment of PEDOT:PSS films
PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was purchased from Heraeus. The concentration of PEDOT:PSS was 1.3–1.7% by weight, and the weight ratio of PSS to PEDOT was 6. MAI was obtained from Dysol. Other chemicals, including PbI2, PbCl2, DMSO, DMF and GBL, were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used as received.
PEDOT:PSS films were prepared by spin coating their aqueous solution on pre-cleaned glass substrates of 1.3 × 1.3 cm2. They were subsequently dried at 120 °C on a hot plate for 20 min. The treatment was performed by adding dropwise 100 μl of a solvent or solution onto each PEDOT:PSS film at 120 °C. After the PEDOT:PSS films were dried, they were then rinsed with deionized (DI) water and dried again at 120 °C. The PbI2-treated films were rinsed with DMF.
2.2.Characterization of materials
The conductivities of the PEDOT:PSS films were measured by the four-probe technique with a Keithley 2400 source/meter. The electrical contacts were made by pressing indium on the four corners of each PEDOT:PSS film on the glass substrate. UV absorption spectra were obtained with a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) were collected with an Axis Ultra DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). He I (21.2 eV) was used as the light source for UPS. The atomic force microscopic (AFM) images were acquired with a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-Mode AFM in tapping mode. The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS films were measured using an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler.
2.3.Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
ITO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol by sonication for 20 min. After drying under N2 stream, the substrates were further treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. A PEDOT:PSS layer with a thickness of ∼40 nm was prepared by spin coating Clevios P VP Al 4083 on ITO substrates at 2000 rpm for 1 min and subsequently annealed at 120 °C for 15 min in air. The substrates coated with PEDOT:PSS were then transferred into a glovebox filled with highly pure N2. The moisture and oxygen levels in the glovebox were less than 1 ppm. The perovskite layer was deposited by spin coating a solution consisting of 1.246 M PbI2, 0.154 M PbCl2 and 1.3 M MAI in cosolvents of DMSO : GBL (volume ratio = 3 : 7) at 1000 rpm for 20 s, and then at 3500 rpm for 60 s. After 50 s from the start of the spin coating, 1000 μl anhydrous toluene was added dropwise onto each spinning film. Then, the as-cast films were annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. The thickness of the perovskite thin films was around 300 nm. The phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) layer with a thickness of about 55 nm was deposited by spin coating a chlorobenzene solution of 20 mg ml−1 PCBM at 2000 rpm for 40 s. A sub-nanometer thick rhodamine 101 layer was subsequently spin coated from its 0.05 wt% isopropanol solution. The devices were completed by thermally depositing 30 nm-thick C60, 0.5 nm-thick rhodamine 101, 0.5 nm-thick LiF and finally 100 nm-thick Ag in a vacuum of &lt;1 × 10−6 mbar. Each device had an area of 0.11 cm2. The PSCs were encapsulated with UV-curable epoxy and cover glass slides in the glovebox. The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was tested in air with a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which simulated the AM1.5 sunlight with an energy density of 100 mW cm−2 and was certified to the JIS C 8912 standard.
