Next, the solution was coated on a smooth glass plate (10 cm × 10 cm) evenly using a wire-wound rod coater, and this plate was dried at 105 °C for 1 h to remove water and form a thin PVA film on the glass plate. After that, the pretreated glass plates were placed at 80 °C until use.
The preparation of EMEs and c-EMEs: first, DGEBA was mixed uniformly with varying amounts of PEG200 (PEG200 : DGEBA in weight = 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively) at 70 °C to form a homogeneous solution. Then, the stoichiometric epoxy curing agent (D230 or PACM) was added to this solution and stirred at 50 °C for 0.5 h. Subsequently, the solution was poured on one pretreated glass substrate and sandwiched with another pretreated glass substrate, keeping the thickness of the membrane about 140–160 μm via adjusting the gap between the two glass plates. The curing process was conducted at 80 °C for 2 h and 120 °C for 2 h to ensure that the curing was completed. Finally, the substrates were immersed in deionized water to dissolve PVA and get polymer membranes. To extract the PEG, the samples were sonicated in water for 2 h and then immersed in deionized water for 3 days, changing once a day. After cold and dry treatment of the obtained samples, they were dried under vacuum for 24 h at 60 °C to remove residual moisture completely. Then the composite membranes were soaked in the liquid electrolyte of 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC (1 : 1 in volume) for 24 h in a glove box to obtain the EMEs which were named EME-1, EME-2, EME-3 and EME-4, respectively, according to the weight ratio of PEG to DGEBA.
After determining the optimal weight ratio of DGEBA : PEG to be 1 : 3, LLTO nanoparticles were added to the solution before adding D230 and the amount of LLTO was 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% by weight of the DGEBA, respectively. The next experimental steps were the same as above, and the prepared c-EMEs were named c-EME-5%, c-EME-10%, c-EME-15%, and c-EME-20%, respectively, according to the different LLTO contents.
2.3Characterization of the composite membranes
The microstructure and chemical characteristics of the composite membranes were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, S-4700, Hitachi Ltd) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nexus 670, USA). The surface area and the pore size distribution of the composite membranes were determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Asap2460, Micromeritics Corporation, USA) method. Two different sets of samples were prepared to test mechanical performance. The dumbbell-shaped samples were used for the initial choice of the PEG200 content in accordance with ASTM D638-5 by using a universal testing machine (Instron-1121, UK) with a tensile rate of 1 mm min−1 and a gauge length of 25.4 mm. To characterize the mechanical properties of the membranes more accurately, strip-shaped samples were prepared with a size of 60 mm × 10 mm × 0.15 mm and measured according to ASTM D882 at a tensile rate of 2 mm min−1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD, 2500VB2+PC, Rigaku Corporation, Japan) spectra were characterized in the range of 5–90 °C to confirm the crystal structure of the obtained LLTO nanoparticles.
To examine the thermal stability of the samples, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen flow over the temperature range from room temperature to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The glass transition temperature (Tg) and cross-linking density (ρ) of the membranes were measured by using dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMA Q800, TA Instruments, USA) over the temperature range from −150 to 200 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The formula of ρ is shown as follows:1where ρ is the cross-linking density of the membranes, E is the storage modulus of the rubber platform above Tg, R is the universal gas constant, R = 8.314 J (mol K)−1, and Ψ is the pre-exponential factor, usually 1.
To determine the electrolyte uptake (η) of the samples, the composite membranes were immersed in the liquid electrolyte for 24 h and η was determined using the following eqn (2):2where W0 and W1 are the weight of the membranes before and after absorbing the electrolyte, respectively.
2.4Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by sandwiching the polymer electrolyte membrane between two stainless steel (SS) electrodes with Autolab PGSTAT 302N (Metrohm), and the frequency window was adjusted from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The formula for the ionic conductivity of the EMEs is given as eqn (3):3where δ, Rb, L and S are the ionic conductivity, the bulk resistance, the thickness of the membrane and the contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte membrane, respectively.
The activation energy of the EMEs was calculated from the lines of log and 1000/T using the Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) equation as follows:4where A, Ea, R, T and T0 are the pre-exponential constant, the activation energy, the universal gas constant, the thermodynamic temperature and the reference temperature, respectively.
The electrochemical stability window was investigated using sandwich cells of Li/EME/SS with the methods of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) (CHI660C, Shanghai Chenhua Co. China). LSV was performed in the potential voltage range from open circuit voltage to 8 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and CV was measured between −0.5 V and 6 V (vs. Li+/Li) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1.
The Li-ion transference number (tLi+) was determined via the steady state polarization method in the Li/EME/Li cell with a polarization voltage (ΔV) of 0.05 V. The initial (I0) and steady-state current (Iss) were recorded by chronoamperometry for 2000 s. Meanwhile, the initial and steady-state values of the bulk resistance (R0b and Rssb) and the interfacial resistance (R0i and Rssi) between the electrode and electrolyte were determined by EIS before and after the potential step test. The tLi+ was determined according to eqn (5):5
In addition, Li/EME/Li symmetric cells were also used to measure the interfacial resistance and the cycling performance of the plating/stripping of metallic Li. To observe the growth of Li dendrites on the anode, the Li/EME/Li cells were disassembled in the glove box after cycling for different durations. Subsequently, the anodes were washed with DOL-DME (1 : 1 in volume) and vacuum dried to remove the remaining electrolyte and solvent. The surface morphologies of the Li metal anodes were observed by SEM.
For the full cell test, a LiFePO4 cathode was prepared by mixing 80 wt% LiFePO4 powder, 10 wt% PVDF and 10 wt% carbon black evenly with an appropriate amount of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. The obtained slurry was coated on the surface of Al foil and dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h. After weighing the cathode sheet, it was assembled together with the EME and Li metal in a 2025 coin cell to form a LiFePO4/EME/Li cell. The charge/discharge test of the cell was performed using a LAND CT2001A battery test instrument in the potential range of 3–3.75 V at a current density of 0.2C.
