Experimental
Materials
Silica (SiO2, average 15 nm) was purchased from Aladdin company. 3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane (γ-GPS, 97%), poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE, average Mn = 500), diamino-poly(propylene glycol) (DPPG, average Mn = 2000), poly(vinylidene fluoride-cohexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP, average Mw = 400 000), and dimethyl formamide (DMF) were purchased from Aldrich. The liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC/DEC 1 : 1 : 1 v/v) was purchased from Shanshan technology. Commercial PP separators (Celgard 2400) were purchased from Celgard company, commercial carbon-coated LiFePO4 was purchased from Shenzhen Dynanonic Co., Ltd (average particle size: 0.2 μm; carbon content: 2 wt%), and commercial LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 was purchased from Hunan Changyuan Lico Co., Ltd. Commercial LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 was purchased from Hefei Kejing Materials Technology Co., Ltd.
Surface grafting of SiO2
3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane grafted nano-silica (γ-GPS-g-SiO2) was prepared as follows: first 300 mg SiO2 was dispersed in a mixture of 90 mL ethanol and 10 mL DI water by ultrasonication, followed by the addition of 30 mg γ-GPS. Under vigorous stirring, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 4 by oxalic acid. The solution was kept vigorously stirring for 4 h at 75 °C. After that grafted SiO2 was collected by centrifugation, then washed several times using a mixture solution of DI water and ethanol, and finally the product was dried overnight at 60 °C.
Preparation of 3D-GCPE/SiO2-GPE/GPE membrane
The 3D-GCPE was prepared by a one-pot synthesis strategy. First, a certain amount of PVDF-HFP (20% of total mass) was completely dissolved in DMF by magnetic stirring at room temperature. Then, proportional dried γ-GPS-g-SiO2 was added into the mixture solution and well dispersed by ultrasonication. Then 0.3 g PEGDA and 0.7 g DPPO were added into the above mixture solution and the solution was kept stirring for 6 h to get a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the solution was poured on a Teflon plate and heated at 8 °C for 24 h to evaporate DMF and make sure all epoxy groups were reacted. Finally, the resultant membranes were obtained after cooling to room temperature and were washed with ethanol three times to remove the unreacted monomer, and then dried under vacuum for 12 h at 60 °C. SiO2-GPE was prepared by the same strategy, replacing γ-GPS-g-SiO2 with pure SiO2. GPE was prepared without inorganic fillers. Membranes were immersed in liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC/DEC = 1/1/1, v/v) for 24 h in an argon-filled glove box, using filter paper to absorb the excess solution on the surface of the membrane before assembling the cell.
Characterization
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet IS 50) was used to record the IR spectra of the samples in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were probed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, HITACHI SU8010). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a D8 Advance diffractometer at a scan rate of 10° min−1 from 10° to 70°. The TGA (TGA2) measurements were performed in a temperature range from room temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mechanical performance of the samples was measured from stress–stain tests using a CMT6104 instrument (MTS industrial systems corporation) with a tensile speed of 10 mm min−1.
Electrochemical measurements
The ionic conductivity was measured in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 mHz by ac impedance spectroscopy using a VMP3 multichannel electrochemical workstation (Biologic Science Instruments, France), with the cell configuration of SS/electrolyte/SS (stainless steel) and test temperature from 5 °C to 85 °C. The ionic conductivity was calculated according to eqn (1):1where L, S, and R stand for the membrane thickness, the membrane area, and the ohmic resistance, respectively.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz using a VMP3 multichannel electrochemical workstation. To study the ionic transference number (tLi+) of the electrolyte, EIS analysis was performed before and after chronoamperometry (CA), during CA a polarization voltage of 10 mV was applied for 6000 s until a steady state was reached. tLi+ was calculated using eqn (2)2where ΔV is the constant voltage applied to the cell, I0 and Is represent the initial and steady-state currents, and R0 and Rs are the initial and steady-state interfacial resistances which were calculated from impedance measurement, respectively.
To evaluate the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out with the cell configuration of Li/electrolyte/SS. The CV was implemented at room temperature from −0.5 V to 6 V (versus Li+/Li) at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 on a VMP3 multichannel electrochemical workstation.
The galvanostatic lithium plating and stripping test was perform on a Land battery test system (CT 2001, Wuhan Land Electronic Co. Ltd., China) at 25 °C with the cell configuration of Li/electrolyte/Li. A LiFePO4 based cathode was prepared by pasting a mixture of active material, carbon black (super-P), and PVDF at a weight ratio of 80 : 10 : 10 on Al foil. LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 based cathodes were prepared by the same process. The cycling and rate performance of cells with different electrolytes were measured on a Land battery test system at 25 °C.
