Conclusions
In summary, we constructed a solid electrolyte of Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 prepared by a high-energy ball milling method. High lithium ion conductivity and a wide electrochemical window were confirmed in our newly designed Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 solid electrolyte. Coupled with the sulfur composite cathode comprising sulfur, carbon black and solid electrolyte, the Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 electrolyte was utilized in the all-solid-state LSBs, which exhibited superior capacity and rate capability to the liquid counterpart. The results indicated that our designed solid electrolyte holds great potential for commercial application in all-solid-state batteries.
