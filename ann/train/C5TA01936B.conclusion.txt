4.Conclusions
DFT calculations predict that tetrazole systems with 2,6-ether substituted phenyl groups in the C5-position are coplanar systems, allowing for resonance stabilisation. This is expected to increase the pKa values into the range of imidazole systems, allowing for efficient PA doping, while still providing two potential sites for proton hopping, as suggested by molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) calculations. Polymers with tetrazole pendant groups were obtained by reacting nitrile containing polymers with sodium azide. While bisphenol A based polymer backbones were chemically unstable under phosphoric acid doped conditions, aromatic poly(ether) based TZ-PEEN was stable and could be doped up to a PA uptake of about 110%. At room temperature, TZ-PEEN and meta-PBI3 showed an equilibrium uptake of 0.5 and 4.7 mole PA per mole heterocycle, indicating that PBI has a higher affinity to PA than TZ-PEEN. Nevertheless, TZ-PEEN doped to a 110% PA uptake showed a proton conductivity close to 25 mS cm−1 at 160 °C with a remarkably low activation energy of about 35 kJ mol−1. Furthermore, a peak power density of 287 mW cm−2 was obtained at 160 °C in a fuel cell test which was not optimised for this class of polymers (catalyst load, cell compression, test procedure, etc.). To our knowledge, this is the highest operating temperature reported so far for tetrazole based systems. Taking all these findings into account, it seems possible that tetrazole based systems can be a way towards materials showing high proton conductivity at low PA contents. This work opens wider prospects for future work, including polymer optimisation: e.g. the linker length (in this paper TZ was directly bonded to the polymer), bonding site (here C5), optimisation of the MEAs, etc.
