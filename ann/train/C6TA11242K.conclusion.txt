4.Conclusion
In summary, a free OH− anion-containing metal–organic framework (FOMOF) FJU-66·[EVIm]OH was firstly achieved through rationally tuning host–guest interactions and developed for the HEMs with high OH− conductivity. FJU-66 shows ultrastable immunity to attacks of heat up to 803 K and of acid–base aqueous solutions from 1 mM HCl to 10 M NaOH, superior to the other extended [Cu3(Pz)3] polymers and most of the MOFs, which comes from the intertrimeric cuprophilicity within its [Cu6(Pz)6] nodes. FJU-66·[EVIm]OH with a low OH− concentration of 0.34 mmol g−1 is a free OH− anion-containing MOF exhibiting high OH− conductivity close to 0.1 S cm−1 with the lowest activation energy Ea of 0.11 eV. The conductivity is the highest value among all the MOF-based HEMs, about 106, 105 and 10-fold the values of FJU-66, FJU-66·0.9NBu4OH and FJU-66·3KOH, respectively. The high conductivity in FJU-66·[EVIm]OH can be attributed to multipoint supramolecular interactions between the robust framework and planar [EVIm]+ cations, which pulls [EVIm]+–OH− pairs far apart and frees OH− anions. The restraint-free OH− anions significantly improve the OH− conductivity. We believe that our findings will encourage further work in the FOMOFs with high OH− conductivity for the HEMFCs by adjusting the host–guest interaction between the alkaline cations and the framework in the near future. In this regard, the integration of the studied material in membranes is under current investigation.
