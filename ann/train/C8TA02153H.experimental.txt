Synthesis of the crosslinker BQB
BQB was used to crosslink DPM/DMBP-QTB and synthesized from TMHDA and DBH (see Scheme S3, ESI). TMHDA (10 mmol, 2 mL) was added to ethanol (48 mL) in a dried 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, to form a 4% (v/v) TMHDA/ethanol solution that was added dropwise to DBH (140 mmol, 22 mL). The resulting solution was stirred at 25 °C for 12 h and at 50 °C for another 5 h. The as-formed solution was poured into ethyl ether (500 mL) and cooled to 4 °C in a refrigerator for 12 h to precipitate the product. After that, the crude product was collected by vacuum filtration and washed three times with ethyl ether to remove the unreacted monomer. Finally, the white solid with 38.7% yield, as the expected BQB, was obtained after vacuum drying at 30 °C for 12 h. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 14N NMR and FT-IR spectra of the BQB are presented in Fig. S15–S18 (see the ESI).
Synthesis of the grafting agent Br-TQA
As shown in Scheme S2 (see the ESI), the intermediates Br-QA and N,N-DQA were first obtained for the synthesis of Br-TQA. To prepare Br-QA, DBH (390 mmol, 60 mL) was first mixed with THF (150 mL) in a 500 mL three-necked flask. Then a 30 wt% trimethylamine aqueous solution (40 mmol, 100 mL) was added into another round-bottom flask. This round-bottom flask was connected to the three-necked flask via a rubber hose. The aqueous trimethylamine solution was each stirred at 30, 40 and 50 °C for 1 h and then at 60 °C for 25 h. The resulting Br-QA was filtered and washed with THF three times. At last, the purified product with 45.9% yield was dried in a vacuum at 30 °C for 24 h. The 1H NMR 13C NMR, 14N NMR and FT-IR spectra of the Br-QA are presented in Fig. S2–S5 (see the ESI).
Next, the Br-QA reacted with TMHDA to produce N,N-DQA. TMHDA (50 mmol, 10 mL) which was dissolved in acetonitrile (80 mL) in a round-bottom flask. Br-QA (20 mmol, 6.0620 g) was dissolved in acetonitrile (50 mL) and then added dropwise to the resulting TMHDA/acetonitrile solution through a constant pressure funnel. The mixed solution was stirred at 40 °C for 12 h and poured into ethyl ether (500 mL). The resulting N,N-DQA (white solid) was filtered and washed with ethyl ether three times. Finally, the white product with 43.5% yield was dried in a vacuum at 30 °C for 24 h. The 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 14N NMR and FT-IR spectra of the N,N-DQA are presented in Fig. S6–S9 (see the ESI).
Finally, N,N-DQA (20 mmol, 9.5080 g) was dissolved in DMSO (35 mL) to form a clear solution and then was added dropwise to the DHB/DMSO mixture (50 mL/30 mL). The resulting solution was stirred at 40 °C for 12 h and then poured into ethyl ether (300 mL). The resulting pale-yellow solid with 37.8% yield, as the expected Br-TQA, was filtered and washed with hot THF three times followed by drying in the vacuum oven at 30 °C for 24 h. The 1H NMR 13C NMR, 14N NMR and FT-IR spectra of Br-TQA are presented in Fig. S10–S13 (see the ESI).
Synthesis of the DPM/DMBP-TB copolymer
As shown in Scheme S1 (see the ESI), the DPM/DMBP-TB copolymer was synthesized from monomers DMBP, DPM and DMM. Briefly, 10 mmol (2.1230 g) DMBP, 10 mmol (1.9830 g) DPM and 100 mmol (7.6090 g) DMM were added into a single neck flask under stirring in nitrogen. The mixture was cooled to 0 °C and then TFA (40 mL) was added dropwise, and the mixed solution was stirred for 0.5 h. The resulting mixture was stirred at 20 °C for 4 h and then precipitated in aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution. The precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with deionized water and acetone successively. Finally, the DPM/DMBP-TB copolymer was obtained by successively dissolving the precipitate in chloroform and precipitated in methanol three times to remove oligomers and insoluble impurities. After that, the product with 86.2% yield was dried in the vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h. The 1H NMR spectrum of the DPM/DMBP-TB copolymer is presented in Fig. S1 (see the ESI).
Synthesis of the DPM/DMBP-QTB copolymer
The synthesized DPM/DMBP-TB copolymer was grafted with Br-TQA to produce the DPM/DMBP-QTB. The DPM/DMBP-TB (12 mmol, 2.8960 g) and Br-TQA (2.4 mmol, 1.7260 g) were each dissolved in NMP (90 mL) and DMSO (30 mL), respectively. These two solutions were then mixed together and stirred at 80 °C for 24 h. The resulting solution was precipitated in 500 mL ethyl ether. The expected DPM/DMBP-QTB precipitate was washed with water three times to remove unreacted Br-TQA. The product with 73.5% yield was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h. The 1H NMR spectrum of DPM/DMBP-QTB is presented in Fig. S14 (see the ESI).
Preparation of cross-linked DPM/DMBP-QTB AEMs
The preparation process of AEMs is shown in Fig. S19 (see the ESI). The DPM/DMBP-QTB was dissolved in DMSO to form a 5 wt% solution. To this solution was added the crosslinker (BQB) (the amount of BQB is X times the active site of DPM/DMBP-QTB, X = 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) and stirred at 40 °C for 2 h to form a homogeneous solution. The mixed solution was filtered through a PTFE syringe filter with 0.45 μm pore. The resulting solution was cast onto a flat glass plate (6 cm × 6 cm) and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h to form a light yellow transparent membrane. The crosslinked membranes were denoted as DPM/DMBP-QTB-X (X = 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0). The membranes in the Br− form were immersed in a 1 M aqueous NaOH solution at 30 °C for 24 h to exchange the Br− for OH−. After that, the obtained membranes were immersed in degassed deionized water for 48 h to remove excess base. Finally, a series of AEMs with different degrees of crosslinking were obtained.
Characterization
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance II 400 MHz with DMSO-d6, D2O and CDCl3 as the solvents and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. The 15N NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance II 600 MHz with D2O as the solvent. The FT-IR spectrum was recorded on a Nicolet Avatar 380 spectrophotometer (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). The morphology and microstructure of the AEMs were observed by SEM (Zeiss Sigma, Germany), AFM (5500, Agilent Technologies), SAXS (SAXSess-mc2, Anton Paar) and TEM (JEM-2100, Japan). The SEM samples were sputtered with platinum to prevent electric charging and improve the electroconductivity. The TEM samples were prepared by the following procedure. The membrane in the Br− form was immersed in a 1 M aqueous Na2WO4 solution at 30 °C for 48 h to exchange the Br− for WO42−, and then the membrane was washed with deionized water and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h. Next, the sample was embedded in epoxy resin and solidified at 80 °C for 24 h. Finally, the sample was cut into a thin slice of 60 nm diameter and collected through copper grids.7 The thermostability of the AEMs was evaluated with a simultaneous TGA/DSC system (SDT Q600, TA Instruments-Waters LLC, USA) in the range of 30–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow (100 mL min−1). Mechanical properties were measured using a universal testing machine (Instron 3343) with a stretching rate of 0.25 mm min−1.
WU and SR experiments
The WU of the AEMs was measured by a previous method.4,35 The samples in the OH− form were first dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 24 h and then weighed as md. After that, the samples were immersed in ultrapure water for 24 h at different temperatures to reach the absorption equilibrium. The wet samples were wiped with filter paper and weighed as mw. The WU of AEMs was calculated using,2
The SR was measured by testing the length of the dry and wet samples and calculated using,3where lw and ld are the length of wet and dry samples, respectively.
IEC measurements
The IEC of the prepared AEMs was measured by a conventional titration method. The AEMs in the OH− form were first dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 24 h and then immersed in a 0.01 M HCl solution (20 mL) for 48 h to replace OH− with Cl− completely. After that, the above HCl solution was titrated with a 0.01 M NaOH solution using phenolphthalein as the indicator. The IEC can be calculated using,4where C1 and V1 are the concentration and volume of HCl solution. C2 and V2 are the concentration and volume of the standardized NaOH solution, respectively. m is the mass of dry AEM samples.
Gel fraction measurements
The gel fraction is used to determine whether the crosslinking is complete in the AEMs. The sample (2 cm × 3 cm) was dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 24 h and then immersed in DMSO solution at 80 °C for 24 h. After that, the sample was further dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 24 h to remove the residual solvent. The gel fraction can be calculated using5where m1 and m2 are the mass of dried samples before and after immersion in DMSO.
Test of hydroxide conductivity
The hydroxide conductivity was measured by the two-electrode AC impedance spectroscopy method and tested in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz on a Parstat 263 electrochemical workstation (Princeton Advanced Technology, USA). The as-prepared AEMs in the OH− form were stored in ultrapure water before testing. During the test, a rectangular membrane sample (1 cm × 3 cm) was sandwiched between two copper electrodes and then immersed in ultrapure water to measure the AC impedance at different temperatures. The hydroxide conductivity of the AEMs is calculated using6where l (cm), R (Ω) and A (cm2) are the thickness, AC impedance and cross-sectional area of the AEMs, respectively.
The alkaline stability of the prepared AEMs was evaluated by testing their hydroxide conductivity after being immersed in a 1 M NaOH solution at 60 °C from the 1st day to 1st month. Before testing, the samples were immersed in ultrapure water for at least 1 day.
Evaluation of single cell performance
The single cell performance was tested on a TE201 fuel cell system (Kunshan Sunlaite, China). The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was prepared with two pieces of carbon paper (2 cm × 2 cm) and a piece of the catalyst coated membrane (CCM) that was composed of a piece of the prepared membrane (3 cm × 3 cm) in the OH− form and catalyst. Here the catalyst ink was prepared by mixing the Pt/C catalyst (40 wt% Pt, Johnson Matthey) and 5 wt% homemade ionomers in the DMF/ethanol (6/1, v/v) mixture. The mixture of the catalyst is evenly sprayed on both sides of the membrane with a Pt loading of 1 mg cm−2 through a nitrogen spray gun. After that, the MEA was immersed in 1 M NaOH at 30 °C for 12 h and then vacuum dried at 60 °C. The MEA was sandwiched with two pieces of carbon paper and then pressed at 1.0 MPa for 5 min. Finally, the MEA was installed into the single fuel cell system. The single fuel cell system was operated at 60 °C, 100% relative humidity (RH) and a flow rate of 50 and 100 mL min−1 of H2 and O2, respectively.
