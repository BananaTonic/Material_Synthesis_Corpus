4.Conclusion
In this study, HMS microspheres are synthesized and functionalized by three kinds of amino acids, including sulfonic acid–amino groups, phosphoric acid–amino groups and carboxylic acid–amino groups. The as-prepared microspheres are incorporated into a Nafion matrix to fabricate novel hybrid membranes with different acid–base pairs. The amino acid functionalized HMS with a large lumen and surface area confers to the membrane strong water retention ability, and the proton conductivity value of the hybrid membranes is more than 8 times higher than that of recast Nafion at 40 °C and 20% RH after 90 min of testing. The presence of HMS microspheres decreases the distance between hydrophilic ionic domains inside the membranes, which contribute to facilitated proton transfer. All the hybrid membranes with amino acid functionalized HMS display high proton conductivity, especially under low RH. The Nafion/HMS-Cys-4% membrane shows the highest proton conductivity of 1.19 × 10−1 S cm−1 under 100% RH and 30 °C. Moreover, the proton conductivity values of Nafion/HMS-Cys-4%, Nafion/HMS-Phos-4%, and Nafion/HMS-Asp-4% at 80 °C and 26.1% RH are 11.1, 5.29 and 8.64 times higher than that of the recast Nafion, respectively. The enhancement is attributed to the continuous proton transfer pathways within the membrane, which are constructed by the amino acids as proton donor–acceptors and retained water as transfer bridges. It is reasonable to conclude that the performance of PEMs could be enhanced by introducing amino acid functionalized fillers with a hollow mesoporous structure to build lower-energy-barrier proton channels.
