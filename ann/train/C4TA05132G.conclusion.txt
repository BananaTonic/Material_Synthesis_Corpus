4.Conclusions
In conclusion, anisotropic ion conduction is dominant for melilite type SOFC electrolytes, with preferred oxide diffusion within the ab plane. The ionic conductivity increases in tandem with concentration of oxygen interstitials, provided there is no symmetry reduction as lower symmetry produces more intricate diffusion paths hindering the ion transport. Moreover, the ionic conductivity also favors smaller interlayer cations. The interstitial oxygen is located inside the pentagonal rings and at the level of the tetrahedral layers. The ion transport is mediated through a cooperative ‘knock-on’ mechanism, which involves tetrahedral distortion and rotation, and the breaking and reforming Ga–O bonds. Combining all the results, it can be concluded that oxygen ion conduction favors those melilite compositions that display incommensurate structural modulations, which generally have smaller interlayer cations and more flexible framework.
