Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
All polymers and linker molecules were synthesized by the literature known procedures, which are provided in the ESI. Both synthesis and characterisation were done repeatedly to ensure the reproducibility of the results. We observed only minor variations in the properties recorded for the materials. PON-1–PON-3, originally synthesized by the groups of Ben,19 Kaskel20 and Han,21 were derived using metal–organic coupling procedures of the Yamamoto and Suzuki type, respectively. PON-4–PON-6, first reported by the groups of El-Kaderi22,23 and Senker,24 were synthesized using a condensation reaction of diamines and aldehydes to the respective benzimidazole linked compounds.25 Structural characterisation of the networks was done by solid-state NMR and IR spectroscopy, as well as PXRD, CHN and TG analysis. The assignments for the respective resonances are given in Fig. 3. In the 13C solid-state CP MAS NMR spectra, for PON-1, PON-2 and PON-4 the tetrahedral carbon signal at 65 ppm (C-1) is the most characteristic (Fig. 3a). For PON-4–PON-6, the 13C signals around 100 ppm as well as the 15N signals at −147 ppm and −238 ppm indicate the formation of the benzimidazole bridging unit. For PON-5 an additional signal at −278 ppm was found in the 15N NMR spectrum, which was assigned to the central amino group of the aldehyde linker.24 The absence of Car–Br (PON-1, PON-2, and PON-3) signals expected at 119 ppm and R–CHO (PON-4, PON-5, and PON-6) signals expected at 194 ppm in the 13C spectrum as well as the one for NH3+ (PON-4, PON-5, and PON-6) at −330 ppm in the 15N spectrum indicate a full conversion of the linker molecules and, therefore, a high crosslinking degree for all polymers (Fig. 3). The results are supported by infrared spectroscopy, which revealed for PON-1–PON-3 vibrational bands at 3030 cm−1 (C–Hstr.vib.), 1066 cm−1 (–CCvib.–) and 800 cm−1 (1,4 subst. benzenes) (Fig. S27). For PON-4, PON-5 and PON-6, the formation of the benzimidazole bridging units results in stretching vibrations around 3380 cm−1 (N–H) and 1595 cm−1 (CN), respectively (Fig. S27). The values from the CHN analysis further determine the structural integrity, as they fit well to the calculated ones (ESI). However, for PON-2 and PON-3, some deviations occurred, which we attribute to remaining impurities in the catalyst.

Morphology and thermal stability were characterized by PXRD and TGA measurements under air, respectively. The former indicated that all polymers were amorphous (Fig. S31). The latter proved the polymers to be temperature stable up to temperatures between 430 °C (PON-3) and 525 °C (PON-2) (Fig. S29). The consistently high thermal stabilities are attributed to the carbon and carbon–nitrogen based polymer backbones, which form strong and persistent networks. Notably, for the benzimidazole containing polymers a small weight loss around 100 °C was observed. Given that the networks are hydrophilic due to their inherent functionality, we attribute this to the incorporation of water molecules upon sample preparation.24
The surface area and porosity of the networks were determined from argon physisorption isotherms measured at 87 K. The surface area was calculated using the optimized BET equation for microporous compounds.26 The pore volumes were estimated by the Gurvich method.27 Further information about pore size and distribution was calculated based on QSDFT adsorption branch kernels for carbon materials, which for three dimensional networks accounts for mixed pores of cylindrical and spherical shapes (Fig. 4). For two dimensional networks, however, we used a kernel which accounts solely for cylindrical pores. Since all networks are amorphous, the given kernels are not suitable to reflect a perfect image of the real porous environment and were, therefore, used to derive an estimate only. In accordance with the literature,28 the highest BET surface area was found for PON-1 and was about 5000 m2 g−1 (Table 1). This network showed a type IV isotherm, typical for primarily mesoporous compounds (Fig. 4). For PON-2 and PON-4, which also reveal a three dimensional morphology, BET surface areas of 700 m2 g−1 and 1270 m2 g−1 were found, respectively. Both networks exhibit type I isotherms, correlated to primary microporous materials (Fig. 4).29 The high surface areas of PON-1 and PON-4 are the result of their linker morphology, leading to an inherent porosity upon polymer formation. With respect to their similar buildup, we estimated their pore volume and pore size distribution using the Gurvich method and the QSDFT adsorption branch kernel for carbon materials with mixed spherical and cylindrical-pores. In accordance with the calculated surface areas the three-dimensional networks showed large pore volumes of 4.73 cm3 g−1, 0.34 cm3 g−1 and 0.54 cm3 g−1 for PON-1, PON-2 and PON-4, respectively (Table 1). The pore size distribution revealed a primarily mesoscopic pore environment for PON-1 (0.20), while PON-2 (0.6) and PON-4 (0.7) both showed a major microporous network morphology (Fig. 4).

With respect to the shape of the polymers, we used the QSDFT adsorption branch kernel for carbon materials with cylindrical pores, since the expression of spherical pores in a two dimensional network is not reasonable. The pore volumes were estimated to be 0.37 cm3 g−1 (PON-3), 0.29 cm3 g−1 (PON-5) and 0.34 cm3 g−1 (PON-6) (Table 1). In accordance with the shape of their isotherms, the pore size distribution for PON-5 and PON-6 showed a primary microporous structure. PON-3, however, seems to consist mostly of small mesopores (Table 1 and Fig. 4 bottom).
Incorporation of imidazole
The substitution of water with nitrogen containing, amphoteric heterocycles such as imidazole already proved to be a promising approach for proton conduction in COFs and PONs.16,30 Since the nitrogen bearing functionalities are strong proton mediators, the formation of protonic charge carriers (C3H3N2H2)+, driven by self-dissociation, leads to extensive hydrogen bond interactions and thus creates proton conduction pathways.8,31,32 The high melting point and stability of imidazole allow temperatures beyond 100 °C to be used and are, therefore, favourable in terms of ion mobility and catalyst reusability. Various procedures for the incorporation of imidazole into porous structures have been reported in the literature, e.g. through solvent, via condensation16 or through a gas phase.33 We found that among all reported methods, gas phase incorporation provides the most reliable data, since only single molecules are incorporated into the pores of a network, which supports an effective pore filling and minimizes condensation as well as crystallisation of imidazole on the polymer particle surfaces. Thereby, we were able to incorporate imidazole into the voids of the respective networks. The success of the imidazole incorporation was monitored gravimetrically and by infrared spectroscopy. For the latter characteristic bands at 2650 cm−1 and 1615 cm−1 were assigned to the N–H⋯N and C–N vibrations of imidazole (Fig. S28). The absence of any Bragg reflections within the PXRD patterns (Fig. S32) corroborates that the frameworks are still amorphous and that imidazole is not crystallizing in the inter-particle voids but fills up the micropores. This finding is supported by DSC data, which indicate the absence of crystallisation and melting peaks (Fig. S33).
The amount of incorporated imidazole was determined by thermogravimetric analysis performed in air, where the weight loss between 150 °C and 200 °C signals the removal of imidazole (Fig. S30). We found the highest uptake for imidazole in PON-1 (1.08 g g−1), which is due to its extended mesoporosity and high pore volume. Interestingly, by comparing the volume of incorporated imidazole (for which we used its liquid density as an estimate) with the theoretically available pore volume, there still remains a major part of free space (Fig. 5). We attribute this to pore blocking effects due to microporous parts of the interconnecting pore system. PON-2 and PON-5 revealed similar uptakes of 0.77 g g−1 and 0.75 g g−1. For both polymers, the amount of incorporated imidazole exceeds the respective pore volume, which might result from the breathing behaviour of the flexible networks.24 With 0.6 g g−1 and 0.43 g g−1 the amount of incorporated imidazole exceeds the pore volume of PON-4 and PON-6, however, only marginally. We attribute the latter finding to an additional filling of microporous interparticle voids. PON-3 (0.23 g g−1) has the lowest uptake value, as well as an incomplete pore filling. In order to estimate the influence of the benzimidazole backbone of PON-4, PON-5 and PON-6 on the proton conduction performance, we calculated the ratio of incorporated imidazole per functional group. While for PON-5 1.8 imidazole molecules per functional group were incorporated, PON-4 and PON-6 revealed ratios of only 1.4 and 1.0, respectively.

Proton conduction
The proton conductivity of the different networks has been determined as a function of temperature (90–130 °C) under a static nitrogen atmosphere. The data were obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a two electrode setup. They have been fitted to an equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 2 and optimized to comply with the shape of the obtained semicircles in the respective Nyquist plots (Fig. 2 and S36–S41).34 The circuit describes two semicircles in the impedance plots, which we assign to charge transfer resistance, for the high frequency circle, and additional boundary effects due to the measuring setup for the ones at low frequencies (electrode contacting, two electrode setup etc.)34 (Fig. 6). The constant phase elements (CPE-1 and -2) are used to describe capacitive parts of the system adapted to influences of surface roughness and system heterogeneity.35,36 Interestingly, for the three dimensional polymers, the two semicircles are well separated, while for the two-dimensional polymers, the semicircles separate to a lesser extent and showed an additional spur at low frequencies (Fig. 6, top and middle). We attribute this behaviour to the sheet-like morphology of the network, which, in comparison to the more granular formed three-dimensional polymers, results in a different contact to the electrodes.

The Arrhenius plot of PON-1–PON-6 obtained from high frequency resistance data measured in a temperature range between 90 °C and 130 °C under a N2 atmosphere (bottom). The colour code is similar to the one in Fig. 1.34
The proton conductivity of the polymers was estimated from the high frequency resistance R1, depicted by the first semicircle in the respective Nyquist plots (Fig. 6, Table 2 and Fig. S34–S39). All samples were preheated to 90 °C to ensure a full equilibration of the system before starting the measurement routine. Interestingly, although all networks rely on imidazole based proton transport, the conduction performance differs markedly (Fig. 6, bottom). While for PON-3, -4 and -6 only low conductivities in the range from 10−6 to 10−7 S cm−1 were observed, PON-5 and PON-2 exhibit conductivities around 10−5 S cm−1. The best values were found for PON-1 (5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1), making this network comparable to state-of-the-art porous polymers like Im@TPB-DMTP-COF15 (4.37 × 10−3 S cm−1, 130 °C), H3PO4@TP-Azo37 (9.9 × 10−4 S cm−1, 70 °C) and Im@Td-PPI16 (3.49 × 10−4 S cm−1, 90 °C). The comparison of the estimated proton conductivity with the amount of incorporated imidazole shows that a high amount of proton mediators is favourable for an excellent performance.

EA for the networks PON-6, PON-3 and PON-4 are 44, 53 and 58 kJ mol−1 and are significantly larger indicating a vehicle type conduction mechanism (Fig. 6) in these cases. This might be due to the lower amount of guest molecules and, therefore, an inhomogeneous charge carrier distribution, which forces charge transport via diffusion of protonated imidazole molecules.
However, the data seem to indicate a direct correlation between observed proton conductivity and the amount of incorporated imidazole (Fig. 7). Interestingly the level of pore filling seems to be subordinated, as PON-1 exhibits the highest conductivity with only 20% pore filling, while PON-6 shows a low conductivity, despite its excessive pore filling. In this respect, pore geometry also seems to have only minor effects, since there is just a slight difference between the two-dimensional PON-5 and three-dimensional PON-2 in terms of imidazole incorporation and proton conductivity (Fig. 7). However, three dimensional polymers seem to be more promising as they tend to express a more rigid porous environment which is favourable for the incorporation of proton conductive species. This statement is based on PON-1 and PON-2, both based on rigid tetrahedral building units, which showed the best performance in this study. Furthermore, the presence of benzimidazole units in the polymer backbone like in PON-4, PON-5 and PON-6 seems to have a negative effect, as the imidazole affixation at the respective functional group is increased. While at lower imidazole to functional group ratios this might impede the carrier movement, due to hindered diffusion, at high ratios the interplay between the guest and functional group might be supported. Among the benzimidazole based polymers, PON-5 exhibits the highest ratio of 1.8 imidazole molecules per functional group (PON-4: 1.4; PON-6: 1.0), which in combination with its small repeating unit is indicative of a dense charge carrier concentration. In consequence PON-5 exhibits a higher proton conduction performance than the competitive benzimidazoles, despite its two-dimensional morphology. Since we expect the conductive imidazole units in PON-4 and PON-6 to be primarily located at the networks of functional groups, not only their conduction performance is lower, but at −58 kJ mol−1 (PON-4) and −44 kJ mol−1 (PON-6) their energy of activation is also much higher with respect to the one of PON-5 (−35 kJ mol−1).
