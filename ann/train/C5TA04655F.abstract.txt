We report a facile approach towards mass production of few layered reduced graphene by low-temperature (160 °C) exfoliation of graphite oxide under ambient atmospheric conditions with the aid of formic acid in a short duration (∼14 min). The obtained reduced graphene showed very high bulk electrical conductivity (1.6 × 103 S cm−1) at room temperature due to restoration of extended conjugation of the sp2 network during rapid exfoliation. Protonation followed by the hydride transfer mechanism has been proposed for the restoration of extended conjugation and high electrical conductivity. BET surface areas of 789 and 1130 m2 g−1 with narrow mesopore distribution (1.9–2.5 nm) were obtained for two different samples prepared by modification in the synthetic methodology. The reduced graphenes were tested as supercapacitors and specific capacitances of 152 and 157 F g−1 with excellent cyclic stability were observed for two samples in aqueous electrolytes.
