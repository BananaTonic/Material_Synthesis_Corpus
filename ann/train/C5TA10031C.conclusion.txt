4.Conclusions
We reported a new design and fabrication process of an electrode material called graphene pellets (GPs) for energy storage applications. The employed catalyst in the form of a sintered nickel template can be easily converted into a GP by CVD. The GPs exhibit good electrical conductivity, electromechanical stability and morphology with a mesoporous structure thus providing great potential for energy storage applications. GP/MnO2 composites prepared by the described simple electrochemical deposition of MnO2 onto the GP surface showed both high specific and volumetric capacitance with small charge-transfer resistance. This demonstrates good synergy between GPs and MnO2. The excellent electrical and mechanical properties of GPs also show great potential in facilitating chemical reactions typical for redox additive electrolyte systems. Moreover, when the GP/MnO2 electrode was assembled with the GP/polypyrrole electrode, the obtained full coin cell showed good performance. The simplicity of the 3D graphene preparation allows GPs to compete with or replace GF in many energy storage applications.
