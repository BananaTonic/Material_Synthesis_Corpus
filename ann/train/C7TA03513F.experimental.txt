Experimental
Materials
Tetramethoxysilane (TMOS, 99%), dihydroxybis(ammonium lactato)titanium(iv) (TiBALDH, 50 wt%), and protamine (98%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Nafion solution (5 wt%, DE520) was obtained from Dupont. 1,2-Dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic acid disodium salt (Tiron, 98%) and 3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane (AAPTS, 95%) were purchased from Aladdin. N,N-Dimethylacetamide (DMAC), methanol and other reagents were obtained from the Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute (Tianjin, China) and used without further purification.
Synthesis of silica–titania (SiO2–TiO2) binary nanoparticles
The SiO2 solution was prepared by stirring TMOS with HCl solution (1 mM) at room temperature for 30 min and adding the resultant solution to a tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5). Simultaneously, the TiO2 solution was obtained by mixing TiBALDH with a Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5). Then the SiO2 and TiO2 solution were mixed and stirred at room temperature for 30 min to obtain SiO2–TiO2 solution.
Protamine was dissolved into a Tris buffer (20 mM, pH 7.5) to get a protamine solution (5 mg mL−1). Then the Tris-buffered protamine solution was added into the SiO2–TiO2 solution slowly. The particles could be observed right after the addition, after reaction for 1 h, the particles were washed 4 times with water to remove the free protamine and then collected by centrifugation. The prepared particles are named SiX–TiY, where X : Y represents the mole ratio of SiO2 to TiO2.
For comparison, alkali-catalyzed SiO2 and TiO2 particles were also prepared. TMOS was added into the mixed solution of ethanol, water and sodium hydroxide, and stirred vigorously for 12 h to obtain SiO2 particles. TiBALDH was mixed with ammonium hydroxide (25 wt%) at 100 °C for 2 h to obtain TiO2 particles.
Functionalization of SiO2–TiO2 binary nanoparticles
Firstly, the SiO2–TiO2 particles were suspended in HCl solution (pH 2.0). Then the prepared Tiron aqueous solution (2 mg mL−1, pH 2.0) was added into the suspension, the reaction was kept at room temperature for 1 h to get the particles functionalized by –SO3H groups. Finally, desired amounts of AAPTS were added into the above solution, followed by stirring at 50 °C for 4 h to get the particles functionalized by –NH2 groups.
Incorporation of functionalized SiO2–TiO2 into membranes
A low-boiling-point alcoholic solvent of commercial Nafion solution will lead to a fragile and brittle membrane structure,26 so a high-boiling-point solvent DMAC is used as the solvent instead for membrane casting. Typically, the obtained Nafion solution was dried at 60 °C for 72 h. The resulting Nafion resin was dissolved in DMAC to get a transparent solution (50 mg mL−1). A premeasured amount of the functionalized SiO2–TiO2 suspension was mixed with Nafion solution under vigorous stirring for 12 hours to obtain a homogeneous solution. The mixture was degassed and cast onto a glass plate, followed by heating at 80 °C for 12 h and annealing at 120 °C for 10 h. All the membranes were activated before use, i.e. soaking in 3 wt% H2O2 (1 h), water (1 h) and 1 M sulfuric acid (1 h) at 80 °C successively. Finally the membrane was washed with water until the pH reached neutral. The pure Nafion membrane is designated as recast Nafion and the fabricated hybrid membranes are named Nafion/SiX–TiY-Z, where Z is the mole concentration of titania–silica in the casting solution, including 40, 100, 160 and 200 mM. The thickness of the as-prepared membranes is in the range of 90–100 μm.
Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was performed using a Tecnai G2 F20 equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDX). The cross-sectional morphology of membranes was observed using a NanoSEM 430 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a Nicolet MAGNA-IR 560 spectrometer, equipped with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) setup. The Raman scattering spectra were recorded on an inVia reflex microscope with light from a He–Ne laser (λ = 532 nm). Solid state 29Si NMR was performed with an Infinityplus 300 MHz spectrometer at 59.6 MHz and a MAS rate of 4 kHz. The crystalline structure was characterized using a RigakuD/max2500v/Pc X-ray diffractometer (XRD) using Cu Kα radiation. The thermal stability was measured using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The specific surface area and pore size were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model with a TriStar 3000 system.
The pick-off annihilation lifetime of o-Ps (τ3) was measured by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) experiments using an EG&amp;G ORTEC fast–fast coincidence system. The radius of the free volume cavity (r3) was calculated by1
The volume of the equivalent sphere (Vf) and the fractional free volume (FFV) could be calculated as follows,23FFV = VfI3
Induction period
The induction period of SiO2 and TiO2 was measured as follows. The SiO2 or TiO2 precursor was added into a mixing solvent of water and ethanol at room temperature. Then a predetermined amount of protamine solution (0.5 mg mL−1) was added into the above solution quickly. The solution was stirred at a suitable speed to ensure homogeneous blending. The period from the addition of protamine solution to the formation of the primary particles is the induction period.
Water uptake and swelling degree
The water uptake and swelling degree of the prepared membranes at 25 and 80 °C were measured as described in the literature27 and calculated as follows,45where the Ww and Wd and Aw and Ad are the weight and area (length × width) of the hydrated and dry membranes, respectively.
Proton conductivity
The membrane impedance was measured on a frequency response analyzer (PARSTAT 2273, Princeton) over the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz. For the measurement of proton conductivity at 100% relative humidity (RH), the temperature was controlled by water vapor from 25 to 100 °C. For the test of proton conductivity at low RH at 80 °C, the RH was maintained at 78.9%, 65.4%, 51.4% and 26.1%, respectively under saturated steam of KCl, NaNO3, NaBr and MgCl2. The proton conductivity (σ, S cm−1) was calculated by6where l0, A and I denote the distance between the electrodes, the effective membrane area and the membrane impedance, respectively.
Single PEMFC performance
Firstly, a certain amount of Pt catalyst (0.1 mg cm−2 for the anode and 0.25 mg cm−2 for the cathode) was loaded on carbon papers. Then the membrane sample (4 × 4 cm2) sandwiched between two gas-diffusion carbon papers was hot-pressed into membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) at 130 °C and 4 MPa for 2 min. The single PEMFC was operated at 60 and 80 °C with humidified H2 and O2, the flux rates of O2 and H2 were 200 and 150 mL min−1 respectively.
