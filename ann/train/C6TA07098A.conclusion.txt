Conclusions
Here, we have reported the synthesis of a novel microporous onion like carbon structure, (MOLC) and demonstrated its excellent performance as an electrode for supercapacitor applications. Our synthesis approach results in microporous carbon onions by using the precursor carbon source (PAF-1) to template micropores and graphitic defects into the structure of OLC whilst maintaining an exceptional surface area. MOLC's high BET SSA and extremely narrow PSD reveal a mechanistic insight into the effect of the size of electrolyte component ion on electrochemical performance. Careful matching of electrolyte ions with the uniform pores of MOLC allows full access to the electrochemically active surface of the highly conductive and porous onions and results in delivering high specific capacitance without compromising power densities. Our microporous OLC are endowed with the curved graphitic surface of OLC, and in addition has microporosity which enables it to overcome the low energy density issue that has to date prevented the use of highly conductive OLCs in commercial devices.20 Finally, we suggest that this new synthesis approach for the introduction of accessible micropores to the structure of highly conductive carbon onions is a good example of the type of advance needed to allow both energy and power characteristics to be significantly improved. This should lead to further performance enhancements and more applications for supercapacitors.
