Conclusions
A novel beehive-like hierarchical nanoporous carbon BHNC has been successfully prepared from an industrial waste of bamboo-based bioactive-substance extraction residues, using a low-cost and environmentally benign bio-inspired approach. The BHNC sample possesses a unique beehive-like hierarchical nanoporous structure on the interconnected carbon nanosheet frameworks and good electronic conductivity, differing from other reported biomass-derived carbons and chemical polymer-derived carbons, which are attributed to the unique natural hierarchical texture structures and high cellulose composition of the bamboo-based precursor as well as the distinct synthesis approach. The BHNC exhibits prominent performances in supercapacitor electrodes (high specific capacitances, high rate capabilities, excellent long-term cyclic stabilities, low equivalent series resistances and fast frequency responses) both in aqueous and ionic liquid systems because of the unique beehive-like nanoporous structures facilitating ultrafast electron/ion transport. Furthermore, on the Ragone chart the BHNC-based supercapacitors possess a high synergetic energy-power outputting property, among the best ever reported for carbon-based supercapacitors. The packaged BHNC-based devices in the ionic liquid system can cross the performance gap between the electrochemical capacitor and Ni-metal hydride batteries. These promising results reveal a green value-added secondary-utilization window for biomass-based industrial by-products to produce advanced carbons as high performance energy storage electrode materials.
