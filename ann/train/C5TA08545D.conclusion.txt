4.Conclusions
The applicability of microcontact impedance spectroscopy to determine volumetric Li+ bulk conductivities of LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li1+xAlxTi2−x(PO4)3 single crystals at room temperature was successfully demonstrated. We were able to show that density can be excluded as a reason for the strong increase in σb of three orders of magnitude (3.12 × 10−6 to 1.73 × 10−3 S cm−1) after substitution with 0.1 mol Al3+ pfu in the LTP structure, which is in contrast to one of the prevailing considerations in previous studies. Moreover, since changes in the crystal structure are almost linear in the LTP–LATP system between x = 0 and x = 0.5, the strong increase in σb is related to the additional Li+ at the M3 position, which displaces the Li+ at M1 sites towards the next M3 position resulting in fast-conducting ions within the NASICON structure. Finally, σb significantly increases as a function of the Al3+ content up to 5.63 × 10−3 S cm−1 for LATP samples with x = 0.1–0.4.
