Materials synthesis
The mixture of powders of Li2S (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), P2S5 (99.9%, Alfa Aesar), MnS (99%, Alfa Aesar) and LiI (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) with an appropriate molar ratio were placed in an argon filled zirconia pot (45 mL in volume) with ten zirconia balls (10 mm in diameter). The mixture was mechanically milled using a planetary ball mill apparatus at a rotating speed of 510 rpm for 30 h at ambient temperature. The resulting powders were then placed in a quartz tube and heated at 250 °C in an argon atmosphere for 2 h to obtain the Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 glass-ceramic. All the preparation processes mentioned above were conducted under an argon atmosphere in a dry glove box (O2 &lt; 0.1 ppm, H2O &lt; 0.1 ppm).
The cathode of all-solid-state LSBs consisted of sulfur powder, Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 solid electrolyte and carbon black (CABOT, America). First, the sulfur and carbon black powders were mixed in a 75 : 25 (wt%) ratio into a zirconia pot and were mechanically milled at 370 rpm for 8 h at room temperature. Then, the S–C composite and Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 glass ceramic were mixed in a ratio of 60 : 40 (wt%). The mixture was also mechanically milled at 370 rpm for 8 h. The three powders were finally mixed together with a weight ratio of S/C/Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 = 45 : 15 : 40. The cathode used in liquid LSBs consisted of sulfur and carbon black mixed in a 75 : 25 (wt%) ratio, which was also prepared by the high-energy ball milling process.
The morphologies and microstructures of the products were characterized using a Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM), TecnaiG2 F20 field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM) and an X'Pert PRO X-ray diffraction (XRD) system with copper Kα radiation from 10° to 50°. Raman spectra were measured using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope at an excitation of 532 nm. The samples were sealed in a chamber with a glass window under an argon atmosphere in a dry glove box. The differential thermal analyzer (DTA) curve was investigated using a Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyzer in nitrogen.
Electrochemical evaluation
The samples were pressed into pellets with 10 mm diameter under 380 MPa and both sides of the pellets were coated with indium foil as current collectors to form the symmetric blocking cells. Ionic conductivity measurements were performed by the alternating-current impedance method through the cold pressed samples in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) was measured on the asymmetric lithium metal/solid electrolyte/stainless steel cell at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 between −0.2 to 5 V at room temperature to obtain the electrochemical window of the electrolyte.
For the assembly of the all-solid-state batteries, Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 glass-ceramic was used as the solid electrolyte to separate the cathode and anode. The S–C–Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 composite was used as the active material of cathode and Li was used as the anode. First, the solid electrolyte powder was put in a 10 mm die and cold pressed at a pressure of 380 MPa for 3 min. Then, the S–C–Li7P2.9Mn0.1S10.7I0.3 powders were put on top of the obtained solid electrolyte pellet and pressed together under a pressure of 380 MPa. A Li foil was placed on the other side of the solid electrolyte as a counter and reference electrode and a pressure of 120 MPa was applied. Finally, the preformed three-layered pellet was attached with two stainless steel disks as current collectors. All the cell assembly processes were performed in a dry glove box.
The liquid LSBs were prepared using the S–C composite as the active cathode material. In a typical assembly process, the active material was mixed with PVDF and NMP to make the electrode slurries. The slurries were cast onto the stainless steel disks with a diameter of 10 mm, dried at 80 °C and then pressed as the working electrode. The batteries were assembled using the S–C composite as the cathode, lithium metal as the anode, 1.0 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTHSI) in 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) (1 : 1 by volume) with 1 wt% lithium nitrate (LiNO3) as the electrolyte and a polypropylene microporous film as the separator.
The charge and discharge behaviors were conducted with a LAND battery test system at 0.05C between 1.5 to 3.0 V at room temperature. The rate performance was tested at various current densities from 0.05 to 0.5C at room temperature. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were determined on a PARSTAT MC electrochemical workstation. Applied currents and charge–discharge capacities were calculated on the basis of the weight of sulfur in the cathodes.
