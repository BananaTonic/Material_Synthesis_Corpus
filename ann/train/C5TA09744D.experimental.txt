3.1.X-ray diffraction
Fig. 1 shows the PXRD pattern for all dried BaSn1−xScxO3−δ samples (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4). These data reveal that all samples are highly crystalline and the patterns indicate that the phases adopt a cubic perovskite structure (space group Pm3̄m) across the range of compositions. The cell parameters, obtained from profile fitting using Jana2006,29 increased with increase of dopant fraction in agreement with the Sc3+ ionic radius (0.745 Å) being larger than Sn4+ (0.69 Å).15 Close inspection of the data revealed evidence of peak shoulders at 2θ ≈ 44°, 54° for the x = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 samples. This behaviour was rationalised in terms of phase segregation into BaSnO3 and a BaSn1−xScxO3−δ phase comparatively rich in scandium in order to preserve the overall stoichiometry of the initial sample reactants. This behaviour was not apparent for the x = 0.4 sample, and its cell parameter of 4.1367(1) Å showed a significant enlargement compared to the value of 4.1156(1) Å determined for un-doped BaSnO3. BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ, which showed the highest incorporation of scandium based on the PXRD results, was therefore selected for further study via neutron diffraction and impedance measurements.

3.2.Neutron diffraction
The NPD data for BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ presented in Fig. 2 revealed that a minor Sc2O3 impurity phase was present in the vacuum dried sample. The large neutron scattering lengths of scandium (12.29 fm) and oxygen (5.803 fm) compared to their relatively weaker X-ray scattering powers could explain why this minor phase was detected in the neutron pattern (Fig. 2) but was not visible in the PXRD patterns (Fig. 1). The Sc2O3 peaks are not visible in the NPD of deuterated BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ where only a single, deuteron containing, perovskite phase is present.

3.2.1.Vacuum dried BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ
As starting models three phases namely, BaSn0.6Sc0.4O2.8 and BaSnO3, both modelled using the cubic Pm3̄m crystal system, and Sc2O3 were included into the Rietveld analysis of the dried sample, phase 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The weight fractions of these three phases obtained from the refinement were 95.55(1) wt%, 3.34(8) wt% and 1.11(1) wt%, respectively (Fig. S1). The Sn : Sc site occupancy in the dominant perovskite phase 1 was reciprocally linked and refined to give a small increase in the Sn : Sc ratio, with 0.666(2) and 0.334(2) site occupancies for Sn and Sc, respectively. The overall sample stoichiometry was consistent with the initial 0.6 Sn and 0.4 Sc molar fractions. Modelling the oxygen atoms with an anisotropic displacement parameter (ADP) significantly reduced the values of the χ2 goodness of fit parameter from 15.66 to 10.86. Simultaneous refinement of the oxygen ADP and occupancy was not deemed reliable due to the high degree of correlation between these two variables. Hence the occupancy of the oxygen site in phase 1 was set to 0.944 as would be expected for a dried sample with a BaSn0.666Sc0.334O3−δ composition with a final χ2 value of 6.372. The final agreement to the data is shown in the supplementary data (Fig. S1). Note that for simplicity we continue to refer to this sample as BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ, despite the slightly lower Sc content of the perovskite phase.
3.2.2.Hydrothermally D2O treated BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ
Given the absence of additional impurity reflections, the Sn4+ and Sc3+ occupancies used in the Rietveld fit to the NPD data were fixed to the nominal values of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively, for D2O treated BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ. The occupancy of the oxygen and barium sites was permitted to vary and both favoured a value slightly above unity and were therefore set to one. This is consistent with complete filling of oxygen vacancies by OD groups as per eqn (2) above during the hydrothermal treatment with D2O. The fit improved significantly by allowing the oxygen ADP factor to vary anisotropically. The deuteron position was investigated by Rietveld analysis and the use of Fourier difference maps as described previously.21 Missing positive scattering was observed near fractional coordinates x = 0.55, y = 0.2 and z = 0.0, i.e. the crystallographic 24k site. The deuteron site occupancy was calculated from the number of filled oxygen vacancies with respect to the refined oxygen occupancy, e.g. BaSn0.6Sc0.4O2.6(OD)0.4, which corresponds to a 24k site occupancy of ∼0.017. The isotropic ADP parameter was then set free to refine together with the atomic coordinates x and y of the deuteron at the 24k site. This resulted in a significant reduction in the standard uncertainties of the refined parameters and a small reduction in the goodness of fit parameters. The deuteron positional coordinates (x, y, 0) refined to (0.579(3), 0.217(3), 0). Results of the Rietveld analysis of the NPD data are listed in Table 1, and the final Rietveld fit achieved is shown in Fig. 3.

3.3.Solid-state NMR
3.3.1.119Sn NMR
The 119Sn magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum of dry BaSnO3 (Fig. S2a in the ESI) shows a sharp resonance at −679 ppm corresponding to tin in a six-fold symmetrical environment.31 This environment corresponds to Sn surrounded by 6 tin atoms in its first cation coordination shell, giving rise to a Sn(OSn)6 local environment,31 the only chemical environment in the undoped BaSnO3 material.
In dry Sc-substituted BaSnO3, a new set of 119Sn resonances with intensity proportional to Sc concentration appears at around −640 ppm (Fig. 4a). This feature is assigned to tin in six fold environments surrounded by at least one scandium cation based on previous NMR studies of the related Y-doped BaSnO3 materials.32 In this system, the six-coordinated Sn cations with various numbers of Y ions in their first cationic coordination shells, i.e. Sn(OSn)5(OY), Sn(OSn)4(OY)2, Sn(OSn)3(OY)3, etc. could be individually observed, the 119Sn resonance shifting by +27 to +34 ppm per added Y ion. Here the 119Sn spectra of Sc-doped BaSnO3 lacks such sharp, resolved features, most likely due to a smaller frequency shift per Sc ion added to the vicinity of the Sn nuclei. Indeed the ionic radius of Sc3+ in 6-fold coordination (0.745 Å) is much closer to the one of Sn4+ (0.69 Å) in comparison to Y3+ (0.90 Å) leading to smaller local distortions in the case of Sc substitution and therefore smaller frequency shifts. A weak but sharp BaSnO3 resonance is seen in all four samples (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) at −679 ppm most likely due to a separate BaSnO3 impurity phase; the weakest BaSnO3 resonance was seen for x = 0.4, consistent with the low phase fraction obtained in the NPD refinement of this phase (Fig. 2 and S1).
119Sn MAS NMR single pulse spectra of (a) dry BaSn1−xScxO3−δ and (b) deuterated BaSn1−xScxO3−δ as a function of Sc doping level x were obtained at 11.7 T and under a MAS frequency of 20 kHz. SnVI and SnV denote six and five coordinated tin environments. Asterisks (*) indicate spinning side bands.
A second broad resonance, centered at −450 ppm (Fig. 4a), is assigned to five-coordinated Sn environments in line with a shift to higher frequency going from six to five-fold Sn coordination,31,32 a trend generally observed for a number of nuclei.33
On hydrothermal D2O treatment of dry BaSn1−xScxO3−δ (Fig. 4b), the 119Sn NMR resonance at −450 ppm, associated with the five-coordinated Sn environments, totally disappears, which is consistent with its assignment, and shows complete reaction of the oxygen vacancies  with D2O during hydration to form six-coordinated Sn environments (experimentally observed at −636 ppm). The sharp −679 ppm resonance is also seen, providing evidence for BaSnO3 environments although no sign of an impurity phase was detected in the NPD data, presumably due to its low concentration.
3.3.2.45Sc NMR
Fig. 5 and S3 (in the ESI) show the one-dimensional 45Sc spectra of dry and deuterated BaSn1−xScxO3−δ as a function of Sc doping level obtained at a high magnetic field of 19.6 T under fast MAS. The spectra of the dry samples contain a main resonance centred at around 110 ppm in addition to a much broader resonance in the 200–100 ppm region, which disappears upon hydrothermal D2O treatment. Solid-state NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei such as 45Sc (spin = 7/2) are often broad even under MAS because of residual second-order quadrupolar interactions. This can be removed by performing a two-dimensional triple-quantum MAS experiment (TQMAS)23–25 whose vertical projection along the F1 dimension yields a one-dimensional isotropic spectrum free of second-order broadening. Such experiments have been recorded for the dry and deuterated BaSn1−xScxO3−δ materials (Fig. 6, S4–S6) and are discussed below.

The spectra were obtained at 19.6 T and under MAS frequency of 33.33 kHz. The 45Sc MAS NMR spectra of dry BaSn0.9Sc0.1O3−δ was not recorded. ScVI and ScV denote six and five coordinated scandium environments. Asterisks (*) indicate spinning side bands.

Top: anisotropic skyline projection (the 45Sc MAS NMR single pulse spectra are given in Fig. 5 and S3). Left: isotropic skyline projection of the TQMAS spectra. ScVI and ScV denote six and five coordinated scandium environments, respectively.
Two sets of resonances are clearly observed in the F1 vertically projected spectra of the dry BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ sample at shifts of approximately 125 and 225 ppm (Fig. 6) demonstrating the presence of two different scandium environments. Extraction of the shifts of these resonances in the horizontal F2 dimension allow isotropic chemical shifts values of around 120 and 200 ppm to be extracted (see Table 2) and assigned to 6- and 5-coordinated scandium environments, respectively, based on previous study by Stebbins et al.,34 our previous work on the BaZr1−xScxO3−δ series,35 and Takamura et al.'s recent hydration study of 10% mol Sc-substituted BaZrO3.36 The 5-coordinated Sc environment which has a very large linewidth (leading to a quadrupolar coupling of around 20 MHz) is ascribed to the presence of an oxygen vacancy in the 1st coordination shell of a Sc atom.

These spectra are now dominated by resonances centered at around 125 ppm and corresponding to 6-coordinated Sc only (Table 2). In fact, more than one 6-coordinated Sc environments are often visible in the 45Sc MQMAS spectra of deuterated BaSn1−xScxO3−δ, and are assigned to ScO6 (as in the dry samples) and ScO5(OD) environments (i.e. 6-coordinated scandium in the vicinity of a protonic defect).
Note that the Sc2O3 impurity seen by NPD was not observed by 45Sc NMR of dry BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ (Fig. 6a). This is attributed to the very small amount of Sc2O3 (1.11%, Table 1), which is probably below the NMR detection limit, and to the fact that the two 6-coordinated Sc sites in Sc2O3 have isotropic chemical shifts of 108 and 128 ppm,34 very close to the value for 6-coordinated Sc in this sample. The lack of resolution might therefore also prevent its observation.
3.3.3.17O NMR
17O NMR is usually very challenging due to the very low natural abundance of 17O (approximately 0.037%), often requiring isotopic enrichment. This is routinely performed in these materials via a gas–solid exchange reaction with 17O enriched O2 gas37,38 at elevated temperatures (see the Experimental section for further details). All the one-dimensional 17O MAS NMR spectra of 17O enriched BaSn1−xScxO3−δ (Fig. 7 and S7) show three sets of resonances, at around 150 ppm, in the 200–300 ppm region, and centred at around 420 ppm (Table 2). The resonance around 150 ppm region consists of a single oxygen environment (see the 17O MQMAS spectra, Fig. S8) and is assigned to a bridging oxygen bound to two tin cations, i.e., Sn–O–Sn, based on our previous work on BaSn1−xYxO3−δ.32 As the Sc content is increased, this resonance remains strongly present (see Fig. 7 for BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ) indicating the lack of significant Sn/Sc ordering in this material. Two peaks are clearly observed in the 200–300 ppm region, their intensities increasing with Sc concentration (relative to those for Sn–O–Sn); they are both tentatively assigned to Sc–O–Sn environments, the presence of two resonances possibly arising from Sc and Sn being five or six coordinated. A third broad resonance centred at around 420 ppm is also observed and is assigned to Sc–O–Sc oxygen environments based on previous work on the related Sc doped BaZrO3 cubic perovskite.35

3.4.Impedance spectroscopy
Fig. 8 shows the complex plane plot of the pre-hydrated BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ sample on heating at 100 °C in dry Ar. Two time constants are observed, including one in the high frequency region near the origin; the data is modelled using two (RQ) elements, representing a resistor and constant phase element in parallel, connected in series. The derived capacitances were 1.17 × 10−11 F cm−2 and 8.14 × 10−9 F cm−2 consistent with bulk and grain boundary processes, respectively. The feature at the lowest frequencies is attributed to electrode processes. For the initial heating and cooling data, it was possible to separate bulk and grain boundary conductivity in this manner at temperatures below approximately 400 °C. At higher temperatures, and for the other atmospheres and thermal protocols, the data were analysed using a similar approach but here the distinction between bulk and grain boundary was not as clear and only the total conductivity (bulk + grain boundary) could be extracted.

The conductivity data collected for BaSn0.6Sc0.4O3−δ under Ar consisted of three regions (see Fig. 9). Region I between 800–1000 °C has O2− anions or possibly electron holes as the dominant charge carriers, while region II, between 400 and 800 °C is characteristic of the growing influence of protons and displays a characteristic plateau39 that reflects the simultaneously varying proton concentration and proton mobility. Region III, at T ≤ 400 °C, is dominated by proton charge carriers. Comparison of the conductivity under dry Ar vs. dry O2 conditions reveals that the sample possesses significantly higher conductivity, approximately one order of magnitude greater, under oxidizing conditions throughout the entire temperature interval as evident in Fig. 10. Conductivity under wet oxygen and above 450 °C was found, unexpectedly, to be lower than that in dry oxygen (Fig. 11).
