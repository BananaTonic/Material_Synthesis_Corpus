A series of novel quaternized polypropylene (PP) membranes with ‘side-chain-type’ architecture was prepared by heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalyst mediated polymerization and subsequent quaternization. Tough and flexible anion exchange membranes were prepared by melt-pressing of bromoalkyl-functionalized PP (PP-CH2Br) at 160 °C, followed by post-functionalization with trimethylamine (TMA) or N,N-dimethyl-1-hexadecylamine (DMHDA) and ion exchange. By simple incorporation of a thermally crosslinkable styrenic diene monomer during polymerization, crosslinkable PP-AEMs were also prepared at 220 °C. PP-AEM properties such as ion exchange capacity, thermal stability, water and methanol uptake, methanol permeability, hydroxide conductivity and alkaline stability of uncrosslinked and crosslinked membranes were investigated. Hydroxide conductivities of above 14 mS cm−1 were achieved at room temperature. The crosslinked membranes maintained their high hydroxide conductivities in spite of their extremely low water uptake (up to 56.5 mS cm−1 at 80 °C, water uptake = 21.1 wt%). The unusually low water uptake and good hydroxide conductivity may be attributed to the “side-chain-type” structures of pendent cation groups, which probably facilitate ion transport. The membranes retained more than 85% of their high hydroxide conductivity in 5 M or 10 M NaOH aqueous solution at 80 °C for 700 h, suggesting their excellent alkaline stability. It is assumed that the long alkyl spacer in the ‘side-chain-type’ of 9 carbon atoms between the polymer backbone and cation groups reduces the nucleophilic attack of water or hydroxide at the cationic centre. Thus, PP-based AEMs with long “side-chain-type” cations appear to be very promising candidates with good stability for use in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs).
