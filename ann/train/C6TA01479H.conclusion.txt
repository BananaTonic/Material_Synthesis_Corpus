Conclusions
We have demonstrated that the level of reduction in pristine NMFP-Br films is small, less than 1%. Even at these low reduction levels, conductivities substantially higher than undoped PCBM or C60 are possible. The fullerene is not greatly reduced by Br− anion, which is consistent with the reduction potentials of Br−and NMFP-Br. By electrochemically reducing the films, up to 64% of complete one-electron reduction can be achieved which results in a peak conductivity of 6.1 × 10−2 S cm−1, a 2.5 order of magnitude increase in conductivity compared to the dry films. The conductivity behavior of the film is consistent with mixed-redox conduction, where the peak conductivity occurs at an intermediately reduced state and where the conduction mechanism is likely self-exchange of redox states throughout the film. The mobility extracted from the conductivity at low levels of reduction was used to estimate that the high conductivity of pristine NMFP-Br films can be achieved with only 0.05% reduction. The correlation of reduction, conductivity and chemical species [NMFP-Br]˙− was made possible by dual-electrode spectroelectrochemistry.
