Synthesis of the homopolymer poly-(2,5-benzimidazole) (ABPBI)
Poly (2,5-benzimidazole) (ABPBI) was synthesized by the homo-polycondensation of 3,4-diaminobenzoic acid (3,4-DABA) (Scheme 1). Poly(phosphoric acid) (PPA, Hn+2PnO3n+1) (13–15 g. approx.) was purged with nitrogen gas in a 200 mL three-neck round-bottomed flask, which was maintained at 120 °C for 1 h to remove moisture completely. 3,4-DABA·2HCl (0.58 g, 2.6 mmol) was then added to this flask, and the mixture was maintained at 120 °C for 1 h. After homogenization, the temperature was increased to 180 °C and maintained for 2 h before increasing it further to 200 °C, which was maintained for 3 h. The reaction mixture turned dark brown from yellow with time, and the viscosity of the mixture increased gradually with time. The resulting solution was precipitated over water to obtain threads. These threads were then crushed, washed with water and dried at 100 °C under vacuum. The ABPBI powder was immersed in a 10% KOH solution overnight and was then washed on filter paper repeatedly with deionized water until the filtrate reached neutral pH. The resulting powder was then soaked in acetone and dried at 100 °C under vacuum for two days to finally obtain the pure ABPBI polymer (yield 95%).
Synthetic route to poly(2,5-benzimidazole).
The structure of ABPBI was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2(a)). The CN peaks for imidazole groups were observed at around 1715 cm−1. Aromatic CC peaks were observed at 1650 cm−1, and broad –NH peaks were also clearly observed at 3300 cm−1. The structure of ABPBI was further characterized by solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR (CP-TOSS) spectroscopy). Five broad 13C signals appeared over the 110–150 ppm range and were indexed as shown in Fig. 2(b).
Synthesis of boronated polybenzimidazole (B-PBI)
A three-necked flask was charged with 15 mL super-anhydrous DMSO. To this flask, 0.520 g (51 mmol, 1 eq.) of ABPBI was added. The flask was kept under vacuum for 1 h at 80 °C to completely remove moisture. The temperature was then decreased gradually to room temperature. LiH (1.22 g) (153 mmol, 3 eq.) was transferred to another flask in a glove box under an Ar atmosphere and was then dispersed in 8–10 mL of anhydrous DMSO. This dispersion was transferred with a syringe to the flask containing the ABPBI solution at room temperature while maintaining the anhydrous conditions. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h (the first step in Fig. 1(a)). The reaction mixture was then stirred at 80 °C for another 1 h, after which it turned red indicating the formation of N–Li linkage due to its reaction with ABPBI. The reaction mixture was then cooled to ambient temperature, and 44 mL (94 mmol, 6 eq.) of triethylborane (BEt3) (1 mol L−1) was added slowly over a period of 30 min while stirring in an ice bath. A yellow precipitate appeared which was dissolved when the mixture was heated to 80 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred for 24 h at this temperature (the second step in Fig. 1(a)). After cooling, the crude brown product was precipitated over toluene–acetone (1 : 1) repeatedly. The product was dried in a vacuum oven for three days at 80 °C to finally obtain boronated polybenzimidazole (B-PBI). The final product was weighed to be 0.80 g (yield 84%).

The FT-IR spectrum of B-PBI (Fig. 3a) showed a characteristic peak44 corresponding to B–N bending at 875 cm−1, and B–N stretching peak merged with the aromatic CC peak at 1350 cm−1; the CN peak was observed at 1500 cm−1. The broad –NH peak on the other hand disappeared as the imidazole proton was substituted by triethylborane. Furthermore, the 11B-NMR spectrum (Fig. 3b) of B-PBI showed a single sharp peak (Fig. 3b) at 2.73 ppm,45 confirming the sole presence of the quaternary borate B-PBI and the removal of the residual starting material.

Preparation of the B-PBI/BMImTFSI composite polymer electrolyte
The typical procedure for preparing the composite polymer electrolytes is as follows: 0.1 g (4 × 10−6 mol) of B-PBI was taken in five different bottles to which BMImTFSI was added in different volumes (35 μL (1.2 × 10−4 mol), 70 μL (2.3 × 10−4 mol), 140 μL (4.8 × 10−4 mol), 210 μL (7.1 × 10−4 mol), and 280 μL (9.5 × 10−4 mol)) to prepare electrolyte mixtures with various weight compositions (66/33, 50/50, 33/66, 25/75, and 20/80, respectively) [Fig. 1(b)].31 The electrolytes were sonicated at 40 °C for 30 min to prepare homogeneous composite polymer electrolytes. The physical state of the prepared electrolytes changed from powder to paste-like gel with an increase in the BMImTFSI amount as shown in Fig. 1(c).

The 11B NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker NMR spectrometer model AVANCE III 400 with a BBFO plus ATMA probe operating at 400.13 MHz, and DMSO-d6 was used as the NMR solvent. The 13C solid-state NMR (cross polarization total sideband suppression/CPTOSS) spectra were recorded at 500 MHz on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer at a spinning speed of 8 kHz, using a standard cross-polarization pulse sequence. The samples were packed in a 7 mm-diameter zirconia rotor with a Kel-F cap and were spun at 10 kHz. A contact time of 2 ms was used and the period between the successive accumulations was 5 s. The number of scans was 10 000. The FT-IR spectra of the polymers were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum One spectrometer using a diamond-attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted using a Hitachi STA7200. The samples (&lt;5 mg) were placed in a platinum crucible and were heated to a maximum temperature of 800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The samples were tested under a nitrogen atmosphere. The 5% (Td5) and 10% (Td10) degradation temperatures of the samples were also investigated along with their temperatures at the onset of degradation (Tonset). The ionic conductivity measurement has been carried out using a complex-impedance gain-phase analyzer (Solartron model 1260; Schlumberger, Germany) over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–1 MHz. The lithium ion transference number of the samples was measured by the method described by Evans et al.32 The measurements were carried out under an Ar atmosphere using identical Li electrodes and a potentiostat coupled with a frequency response analyser (Versastat-3; Princeton Applied Research Co. Ltd.). The impedance measurements were carried out over the frequency range of 100 kHz–10 MHz. A DC potential of 0.03 V (vs. Li/Li+) was used during the polarization studies. The Evans–Vincent–Bruce equation was used to calculate the tLi+ of the samples:where Io and Is are the initial and steady state current, respectively, Ro and Rs refer to the charge transfer resistance for the initial and steady states, respectively, and ΔV is the DC potential applied across the cell and current determined by the DC polarization. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were performed in a sandwich cell with a Li/binary mixture electrolyte/Pt configuration. The measurements were performed at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, over the potential range of 0–6 V vs. Li/Li+ using a BioLogic VSP s/n 1190 set-up. The charge–discharge analytical studies were carried out using a silicon-based anodic half-cell prepared using CR2025 type coin cells with silicon as the working electrode (ϕ15 mm, kindly donated by NISSAN Co.), lithium metal as the counter electrode (ϕ15 mm, Honjo Metal, Japan) and a disc-shaped polypropylene based membrane (Celgard) as the separator (16 mm). The prepared silicon-based anodic half-cell was charged and discharged in a galvanostatic mode with a cut off potential limit (1.5 V–0.01 V) at various current rates ranging between 0.1 and 2C using a compact charge and discharge system (EC Frontier; ECAD-1000). DEIS measurements were carried out on a VSP potentiostat (BioLogic) electrochemical analyser/workstation over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 10 mHz with a sinus amplitude of 10 mV. The DEIS measurements were carried out at the open circuit potentials (OCPs) of 1.650 V–0.01 V during charging and in the reverse direction during discharging. The step potential was divided equally into 16 steps. Rheological measurements were carried out using a rheometer (MCR301, Anton Paar) with a stainless steel cone plate having a diameter of 25 mm (CP25, Anton Paar). The minimum torque which could be detected by the rheometer was 0.1 μN m. During the viscoelastic measurements, the temperature was maintained at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C using a Peltier plate. The samples were directly loaded in a nitrogen atmosphere. At first, a strain sweep test was carried out to determine the linear viscoelastic (LVE) region from the initial strain value of 0.01 to the final strain value of 10 with a constant frequency of 1 rad s−1. The frequency sweep test was carried out in the LVE region (γ = 0.01%) over the frequency range of 0.01–60 rad s−1.
