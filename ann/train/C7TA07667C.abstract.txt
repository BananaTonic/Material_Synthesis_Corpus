Optimisation of oxide-ion conductivity in acceptor-doped Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 perovskite: approaching the limit?Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c7ta07667c
Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT) perovskite is often considered as a potential lead-free piezoelectric material but it can also be an excellent oxide-ion conductor (M. Li et al., Nature Materials, 13, 2014, 31–35). Here we report the non-stoichiometry and oxide-ion conductivity of undoped and acceptor-doped NBT. A range of acceptor-type ions with varying doping levels are selected to incorporate into NBT or Bi-deficient NBT (nominal Na0.5Bi0.49TiO2.985; NB0.49T). Low levels of acceptors (typically &lt; 2 at%) can be doped on both cation sites of NBT by an ionic compensation mechanism to create oxygen vacancies and are therefore effective in enhancing the bulk oxide-ion conductivity to values of ∼2 mS cm−1 at 400 °C. A maximum enhancement of less than 1 order of magnitude is achieved using either A-site Sr (or Ca) or B-site Mg doping in NB0.49T. This conductivity maximum is in good agreement with an oxygen-vacancy diffusivity limit model in a perovskite lattice proposed by R. A. De Souza (Advanced Functional Materials, 25, 2015, 6326–6342) and suggests that optimisation of the ionic conductivity in NBT has been achieved. Our findings on NBT illustrate that this approach should be applicable to other acceptor-doped perovskite oxides to determine their electrolyte (oxide-ion) conductivity limit.
