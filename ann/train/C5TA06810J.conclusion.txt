3.Conclusions
In summary, two highly conductive LCILs [C16MIm]PF6 and [C16MIm]BF4 have been successfully incorporated in ITO-free PSCs by spin-coating on the surface PH1000 films as transparent anodes for high performance PSCs. LCILs modification can remove half of the insulating PSS on the top surface of the PH1000 and induce the formation of PEDOT with ordered and continuous molecular packing. At the same time, spontaneous orientation of LCILs with liquid crystalline property can further promote the ordered packing arrangement of both PH1000 and the active layer. As a result, compared to pristine PH1000, LCILs modified PH1000 possesses dramatically improved conductivity. Consequently, a high performance ITO-free device based on an LCIL-modified PH1000 anode without extra HTL has been realized. It also should be noted that PH1000/LCIL has a universal application as an anode for versatile ITO-free devices. These findings indicate that a solution-processed PH1000/LCIL electrode shows great potential applications in the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs as well as large-area, flexible printed PSCs.
