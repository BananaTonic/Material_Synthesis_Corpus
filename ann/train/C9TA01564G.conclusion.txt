4.Conclusions
In this work, new innovative CO2-sourced polycarbonates were synthesized and optimized as solid electrolytes for room temperature operating lithium batteries. Using these polymers, the electrochemical performance of conventional PEO-SPEs has been improved by the incorporation of a few carbonyl groups. The functional polycarbonates have been synthesized by organocatalyzed polyaddition of CO2-sourced bis(α-alkylidene carbonate)s (bis-αCCs) with polyethylene oxide diols at room temperature. After analyzing all the polycarbonates designed, the mechanical properties of the best candidate were improved. The SPE with the highest number of ethylene oxide units presented the most valuable electrochemical properties. After analyzing the ionic conductivity (10−4 S cm−1 at 60 °C), lithium transference number (0.28) and electrochemical stability (5 V), the battery performance was evaluated at 60 °C with LFP as a cathode. The SPE shows a capacity of 83 mA h g−1 even after cycling the battery at a C-rate of 1C at 60 °C. These promising results lead to including 10 wt% tetraglyme in the formulation of the SPE with the final goal of cycling the battery at room temperature. All in all, this work corroborates the potential of polycarbonates as solid polymer electrolytes for batteries and highlights the potential of an emerging class of CO2-sourced monomers and polymers23,60 for this important application.
