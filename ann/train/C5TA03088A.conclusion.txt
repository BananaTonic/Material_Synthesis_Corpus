Conclusion
A series of octa-sulfonated poly(arylene ether)s (SPAE-x) was prepared via a low-temperature grafting reaction and subsequent postsulfonation. The polymer backbone was obtained via copolymerization of a difunctional monomer, DHDPS and DFB. The grafting reaction proceeded at a lower temperature (80 °C) by using a highly reactive multi-phenyl monomer. The rigid backbone with high molecular weight is conducive to better integrity of the hydrophobic domain. And the grafting ionic clusters are expected to promote the appearance of phase separation. Compared to our earlier work, these membranes exhibited enhanced dimensional stability and superior proton conductivity. SPAE-18, with IEC = 1.90 meq. g−1, exhibited comparable conductivity (3 mS cm−1) with Nafion 117 (3.6 mS cm−1), even under reduced humidity (33% RH). In addition, SAXS profiles confirmed the well-defined phase-separated morphology of SPAE-x. Additionally, the DMFC single cell performance demonstrated that these octa-sulfonated polymers are promising candidates for PEM in fuel cell applications.
