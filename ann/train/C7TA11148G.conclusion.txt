Conclusions
The TE properties of PEDOT:PSS films can be significantly enhanced by a facile and mild post-treatment with cosolvents and/or salt-cosolvent solutions. By the treatment with cosolvents of 80% organic solvents and 20% water at 120 °C, the electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS films can be significantly enhanced from 0.2 to 1055 S cm−1, while the Seebeck coefficients are in the range of 20.6–25.1 μV K−1. The resultant PFs of these cosolvent-treated PEDOT:PSS films vary from 21.0 to 52.5 μW m−1 K−2, remarkably higher than that of a neat solvent-treated one. Such an enhancement can be attributed to the preferential solvation of the PEDOT and PSS chains with organic solvents and water, respectively. After the cosolvent treatment, water rinsing is also found to facilitate a higher TE property enhancement than non-rinsing and cosolvent rinsing. When organic salt MAI is added to a cosolvent, the conductivities and Seebeck coefficients of the PEDOT:PSS films can be further enhanced by a treatment with cosolvent solutions. Presumably, synergetic effects between the salt and cosolvent induce the phase segregation/removal of PSS chains from PEDOT:PSS and also lead to the conformational change of the PEDOT chains. Under the optimal treatment conditions with a cosolvent solution of 1 M MAI in 80% DMF–20% water, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of the PEDOT:PSS films are enhanced to be 1821 S cm−1 and 28 μV K−1, respectively. As a result, the corresponding PF and ZT reach 144 μW m−1 K−2 and 0.11 at room temperature. The PF and ZT are among the highest values ever achieved for PEDOT:PSS films via a one-step post-treatment.
