Results and discussion
XRPD patterns of Nd1−xSrxBaInO4−x/2 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) identified the final products to be the monoclinic P21/c NdBaInO4 phase, except x = 0.4, which showed a different XRPD pattern with additional peaks, indicating possible saturation of the dopant within the NdBaInO4 structure (Fig. 1a). We found that the total electrical conductivity of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 is higher than that of NdBaInO4, Nd0.8Sr0.2BaInO3.9, and Nd0.7Sr0.3BaInO3.85 (Fig. 1b). Therefore, we focused on the Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 composition for further detailed studies.

The dashed lines indicate the peak positions of the pure NdBaInO4 phase. The black triangles show additional peaks that only appeared in Nd0.6Sr0.4BaInO3.8.

Fig. 2a shows the P(O2) dependence of the total electrical conductivity σtotal of NdBaInO4 and Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 at 858 °C. With decreasing P(O2), the σtotal decreased in the high P(O2) range (region [A] and [B] in Fig. 2a), was constant in the intermediate P(O2) range (region [C] in Fig. 2a) and increased in the low P(O2) range (region [D] in Fig. 2a). The slope of log(σtotal) versus log(P(O2)) of NdBaInO4 in the P(O2) range from 5.9 × 10−4 to 2.0 × 10−1 atm is 0.215(2) and of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 in the P(O2) range from 5.7 × 10−3 to 2.0 × 10−1 atm is 0.216(6), which indicates that these materials show p-type conductivity in region [A], and mixed oxide-ion and hole conduction in region [B]. The constant conductivities independent of P(O2) in region [C] indicate that both NdBaInO4 and Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 materials show pure oxide-ion conduction.
(a) Partial oxygen pressure P(O2) dependence of the total electrical conductivity σtotal (858 °C) of NdBaInO4 (black) and Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 (red). The dominant carriers are electron holes in P(O2) region [A], oxide ions and electron holes in [B], oxide ions in [C], and the oxide ions and electrons in [D]. (b) Arrhenius plots of the total conductivity σtotal (circles) and ionic conductivity σion (triangles) of NdBaInO4 (black) and Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 (red). σtotal values were measured in air and σion values were measured under P(O2) = 3.6 ± 2.6 × 10−17 atm for NdBaInO4 and P(O2) = 8.8 ± 6.2 × 10−14 atm for Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95.
Fig. 2b shows Arrhenius plots of the total electrical conductivity σtotal (circles in Fig. 2b) and oxide-ion conductivity σion (triangles in Fig. 2b) of NdBaInO4 (black) and Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 (red). Over the entire temperature range, the total electrical conductivity σtotal and oxide-ion conductivity σion of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 are higher than those of NdBaInO4. For example, the σtotal and σion of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 at 858 °C were 7.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 7.7 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively, are higher than those of NdBaInO4 1.0 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 3.6 × 10−5 S cm−1, respectively. The hole conductivities of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 and NdBaInO4 were calculated to be 6.5 × 10−3 and 9.6 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively, at 858 °C. The activation energies of total, oxide-ion, and hole conductivities of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 were 0.685(7), 0.795(10), and 0.673 eV, which are lower than those of NdBaInO4 (0.952(13), 0.91(4), and 0.953 eV). Therefore, 10 mol% Sr doping into NdBaInO4 improves the oxide-ion conductivity and lowers its activation energy.
To investigate the structure changes in NdBaInO4 by 10 mol% Sr doping, Rietveld analysis was conducted for Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 based on the synchrotron XRPD and NPD data using RIETAN-FP12 and Z-Code.13 Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 is isostructural with NdBaInO4 (space group P21/c) and has seven independent sites at the general position, Nd, Ba, In, O1, O2, O3, and O4 (Table 2).8 The site preference of Sr was investigated in a preliminary analysis that gave the best reliable factors, Rwp and RB, in the case that Sr exists at the Nd site (Table S2 in (ESI)). Here, Rwp is the weighted reliability factor of profile intensity and RB is the reliability factor based on integrated intensities. Therefore, the occupancy factors were fixed to g(Nd,Nd) = 0.9 and g(Sr,Nd) = 0.1 in the final refinement. Here, g(Y,X) represents the occupancy factor of atom Y at the X site. The refinement of the occupancy factors of the oxygen atoms using common values for all oxygen atoms yields 0.9842(10), which clearly indicates the existence of oxygen vacancies. The value agrees with the expected value of 0.9875 calculated from the charge balance. In the final refinement, the occupancy factors of oxygen atoms were fixed to 0.9875. The TGA of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 showed 0.18% weight loss between 50 and 800 °C, which corresponds to δ = 0.05 of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95−δ (Fig. 3). Here, (0.05 + δ) is the amount of oxygen vacancies. Thus, the occupancy factors of oxygen atoms were fixed to 0.975 for the high-temperature (800 °C) data. The final Rietveld patterns are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The final refined atomic coordinates are shown in Table 1 for the TOF neutrons data and Table S1 in the ESI for the synchrotron X-ray and the angle dispersive type neutron data.

The weight loss from 50 to 800 °C was 0.18 wt%, which corresponds to the increase in the oxygen vacancy content δ = +0.05.

(d) Bond valence-based energy (BVE) landscape for an oxide ion with an isovalue at 1.6 eV in Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.90 at 800 °C. Here, A and A′ are relatively large cations ((Nd,Sr) and Ba in this case) and B is a smaller cation (In in this case).
Comparing the unit-cell parameters between 24 °C and 800 °C, the a-, b- and c-axes increased and the β-angle decreased with increasing temperature. The average thermal expansion coefficients between 24 °C and 800 °C were found to be αa = 1.23(4) × 10−5 K−1, αb = 1.07(3) × 10−5 K−1, αc = 0.72(4) × 10−5 K−1, αβ = −3.73(17) × 10−5 K−1, and  = 1.06(2) × 10−5 K−1 (the definition of these coefficients are described in section D of the ESI). These average thermal expansion coefficients of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 are similar to those of NdBaInO4 between 20 °C and 1000 °C (αa = 1.42(2) × 10−5 K−1, αb = 1.176(14) × 10−5 K−1, αc = 0.77(3) × 10−5 K−1, αβ = −3.81(4) × 10−5 K−1, and  = 1.176(15) × 10−5 K−1). There was an anisotropy observed in the thermal expansion. The average thermal expansion coefficients are similar for the a- and b-axes, whereas that of the c-axis is lower than the others. The average linear thermal expansion coefficients  of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 (1.06(2) × 10−5 K−1) and NdBaInO4 (1.176(15) × 10−5 K−1) are close to that of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ), which is favourable for using this material as a cathode in SOFC applications. The average thermal expansion coefficients of 3 and 8 mol% Y2O3–ZrO2 between 20 and 1000 °C were reported to be 1.08 × 10−5 and 1.05 × 10−5 K−1, respectively.14
The crystal structure of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 at 24 °C comprises the A rare earth structure A2O3 ((Nd,Sr)2O3) and the perovskite (A,A′)BO3 ((Nd,Sr)2/8Ba6/8InO3) units (Fig. 4c) which belongs to the same structural family as NdBaInO4.8 Here, A and A′ are relatively large cations and B is a smaller cation. The unit-cell volume at 24 °C of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 (443.184(2) Å3) is slightly larger than that of NdBaInO4 (441.8905(3) Å3). The larger volume is ascribed to the larger ionic radius15 of Sr2+ (1.21 Å for coordination number (CN) of 7) than that of Nd3+ (1.046 Å for CN = 7). The calculated bond valence sums (BVSs)16 from the bond lengths are 1.77 for Ba, 2.85 for (Nd0.9Sr0.1) and 2.99 for In sites in Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95. These values are consistent with their formal charges 2, 2.9, and 3, respectively, which indicates the validity of the refined crystal structure of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95.
As described above, Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 contains oxygen vacancies, while there are no significant oxygen vacancies within the 3σ of refined occupancy in NdBaInO4 at room temperature, where σ is the estimated standard deviation.8 Considering that Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 has a much higher oxide-ion conductivity than NdBaInO4, the dominant carrier for the oxide-ion conduction in Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 is the oxygen vacancy. The activation energy of the oxide-ion conduction is a little lower for Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 (0.795(10) eV) than that for NdBaInO4 (0.91(4) eV). The lower activation energy of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 is attributable to the larger bottleneck size for the oxide-ion diffusion in Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 compared with NdBaInO4. TGA of NdBaInO4, and Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 showed little weight loss (around 0.02%) above 600 °C. Therefore, the effect of the carrier concentrations on the activation energy is thought to be negligible.
Diffusion pathways of oxide ions in the crystal structure of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 and NdBaInO4 were investigated by the bond valence based energy (BVE)17 using the program 3DBVSMAPPER18 based on the crystal structure at 800 °C. The blue surfaces in Fig. 4d represent the isosurfaces where the BVE for an oxide ion is +1.6 eV. In this landscape, the most stable position (at O4) was set to 0 eV. BVE isosurfaces around O1 and O2 sites are localized, while those around O3 and O4 sites spread in the A rare earth structure A2O3 ((Nd,Sr)2O3) unit and are connected with each other along both the b- and c-axes. The lowest energy path for oxide-ion conduction in Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 was found to be along the b-axis with an energy barrier of 1.42 eV. The energy barriers of the path along the a- and c-axes were calculated to be 2.72 and 1.47 eV for Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95. The paths along the b- and c-axes have similar energy barriers and the path along the a-axis has significantly higher energy barriers than the others. Thus, the oxide-ion conduction in Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 would be two dimensional.
BVE barriers of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 have lower values than those of NdBaInO4 along the oxide-ion diffusion paths. The energy barriers along the a-, b- and c-axes calculated based on the crystal structures at 24 °C are 1.47, 2.88, and 1.69 eV for Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 and 1.72, 3.95, and 2.01 for NdBaInO4. These results are consistent with the experimental data that showed that Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 has a lower activation energy of oxide-ion diffusion than NdBaInO4. The highest BVE point along the possible oxide-ion diffusion path is surrounded by two (Nd or (Nd,Sr)) and one Ba cations, which forms a cation triangle bottleneck. The areas of the triangles were calculated to be 6.889(5) Å2 for NdBaInO4 and 6.911(3) Å2 for Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95. Thus, the substitution of Nd with Sr increases this bottleneck area, and hence, lowers the activation energy of oxide-ion conduction.
