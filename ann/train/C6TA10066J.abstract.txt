Solid electrolyte is regarded as a perfect way to enhance safety issues and boost energy density of lithium batteries. Herein, we developed a type of free-standing poly(propylene carbonate)/Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 composite solid electrolyte for ambient temperature and flexible solid-state lithium batteries. The composite solid electrolyte exhibited excellent comprehensive performance in terms of high ionic conductivity (5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1) at 20 °C, a wide electrochemical window (4.6 V), high ionic transference number (0.75) and satisfactory mechanical strength (6.8 MPa). When evaluated as solid electrolyte for an ambient-temperature solid lithium battery, such a composite electrolyte delivered excellent rate capability (5C) at 20 °C. This superior performance can be comparable to a liquid electrolyte-soaked PP separator-based lithium battery at room temperature. To our knowledge, this is the best rate capability of a solid composite electrolyte for a solid lithium battery at ambient temperature. Moreover, such a composite electrolyte-based flexible LiFePO4/Li4Ti5O12 lithium ion battery delivered excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability. All these fascinating features make poly(propylene carbonate)/Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 a very promising all-solid-state electrolyte for flexible solid lithium batteries. Our study makes a big step into addressing the challenges of ambient-temperature solid lithium batteries.
