2.1Materials and measurements
All reagents and solvents used in synthesis studies were commercially available and used as supplied without further purification. H2NDI was synthesized similar to published procedures.19 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was carried out with a PANalytical X'Pert3 powder diffractometer equipped with a Cu-sealed tube (λ = 1.541874 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA over the 2θ range of 5–30°. The Fourier transform infrared (KBr pellets) spectra were recorded in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 on a Thermo Nicolet 5700 FT-IR instrument. Thermal analysis was carried out on a METTLER TGA/SDTA 851 thermal analyzer from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out with a Mettler Toledo DSC 822e at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. SEM images were obtained with a JEOL JSM-7500F scanning electron microscope. The samples were sputtered with Au (nano-sized film) prior to imaging. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance III 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer as solutions in D2O. Elemental analyses (C, H and N) were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240C analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a VG Scientific ESCA Lab Mark II spectrometer using Al Kα as the X-ray source. All binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak of the surface adventitious carbon at 284.6 eV. Solid state UV-vis spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950. Luminescence spectra were investigated on a FLS980 with a 450 W xenon lamp. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis was performed on an Ultima 2.
2.2Syntheses
Synthesis of FJU-66·S
A mixture of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0.0242 g, 0.1 mmol), H2NDI19 (0.0227 g, 0.05 mmol), H3BTC (0.025 g, 0.12 mmol), DMF/MeOH (4 mL/1 mL) and 1 mol L−1 HCl (0.5 mL) was stirred for 5 minutes and then transferred to a Teflon-lined 23 mL Parr acid digestion bomb, heated to 150 °C and kept at the temperature for 3 days. Red crystals were obtained, then they were collected and washed with DMF and dried in air. Yield 45% (based on H2NDI). Elemental analysis for FJU-66·S (Cu6C84H90N20O22) (%) calcd: C 47.68, H 4.26, N 13.25; found: C 47.08, H 4.45, N 12.82.
Activation of the FJU-66·S sample
After the bulk of the solvent was decanted, the freshly prepared sample of FJU-66·S (∼0.15 g) was soaked in ∼10 mL acetone for 1 hour, and then the solvent was decanted. Following the procedure of acetone soaking and decanting for ten times, the solvent-exchanged samples were activated by vacuum at 80 °C for 24 hours till the pressure of 5 μmHg to get the activated sample FJU-66. X-ray single crystal diffraction of the sample FJU-66 in a N2 atmosphere at 297 K shows no electron density in the voids, confirming the effectiveness of the activation procedure.
Synthesis of FJU-66·[EVIm]OH
The activated sample FJU-66 (0.2 g) was suspended in a mixed solution of 20 mL ethanol (EtOH) and [EVIm]OH (2 g, 0.014 mol) and then was stirred under ambient temperature for 24 hours. The solids were collected by centrifugation, then washed with ethanol solvent for several times and dried in air to yield FJU-66·[EVIm]OH. Elemental analysis for FJU-66·[EVIm]OH·12H2O·19EtOH (Cu6C117H199N20O44) (%) calcd: N 9.42, C 47.26, H 6.69; found: N 9.37, C 47.45, H 6.75.
Synthesis of FJU-66·3KOH
FJU-66·3KOH was prepared similar to FJU-66·[EVIm]OH, except that KOH (0.785 g, 0.014 mol) was used instead of [EVIm]OH. Elemental analysis for FJU-66·3KOH·28H2O·2EtOH (Cu6K3C76H119N18O45) (%) calcd: N 10.07, C 36.44, H 4.75; found: N 9.94, C 36.79, H 4.80. ICP analysis performed to gauge the relative contents of K and Cu reveal that the K/Cu ratio is 1.00 : 2.07 which is in good agreement with the elemental analysis (Table S8).
Synthesis of FJU-66·0.9NBu4OH
FJU-66·0.9NBu4OH was prepared analogously to the synthesis of FJU-66·[EVIm]OH, except that NBu4OH (3.633 g, 0.014 mol) was used instead of [EVIm]OH. Elemental analysis for FJU-66·0.9NBu4OH·12H2O (Cu6C86.4H105.3N18.9O24.9) (%) calcd: N 11.99, C 46.70, H 4.66; found: N 12.09, C 47.38, H 4.81.
2.3Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies
For data collection and structural analysis of crystals of FJU-66·S, the activated sample FJU-66 and FJU-66·[EVIm]OH were collected on an Agilent Technologies Super Nova Single Crystal Diffractometer using graphite monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å). The crystal was kept at 100 K during data collection. Using Olex2,20 the structure was solved with the Superflip structure solution program using Charge Flipping and refined with the ShelXL21 refinement package using Least Squares minimization. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms on the ligands were placed in idealized positions and refined using a riding model.
Single-crystal X-ray crystallography
For FJU-66·S, we employed PLATON22/SQUEEZE23 to calculate the diffraction contribution of the solvent molecules and thereby produce a set of solvent-free diffraction intensities.

2.4Gas adsorption
Nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ethylene, ethane and acetylene adsorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 surface area analyzer for the activated sample FJU-66 and FJU-66·[EVIm]OH. The sorption measurement was maintained at 77 K with liquid nitrogen and at 273 K with an ice-water bath (slush), respectively.
2.5Proton conductivity measurement
The samples were pressed under a pressure of ∼0.19 t to obtain pellets of the powder samples. The sample length was 0.10–0.30 cm, with a 0.25 cm diameter. Measurements were performed using an impedance and gain-phase analyzer (Solartron analytical ModuLab 1260) over the frequency range from 100 Hz to 1 MHz with an input voltage amplitude of 100 mV. Measurements were taken under hydrated conditions and performed at thermal equilibrium by holding for 30 min in the temperature range from 20 to 85 °C. Ionic conductivity was calculated using the following equation:where l and S are the length (cm) and cross-sectional area (cm2) of the samples, respectively, and R, which was extracted directly from the impedance plots, is the bulk resistance of the sample (Ω). The activation energy (Ea) for the conductivity of the materials was estimated from the following equation:where σ is the ionic conductivity, σ0 is the preexponential factor, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. ZView software was used to extrapolate impedance data results by means of an equivalent circuit simulation to complete the Nyquist plot and obtain the resistance values.
