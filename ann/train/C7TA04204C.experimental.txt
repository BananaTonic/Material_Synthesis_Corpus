Preparation of PIL–P12FSI solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs)
A polymeric ionic liquid (PIL), poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (P(DADMA)-TFSI), was synthesized by an anion exchange reaction that was reported before.36
The synthesis route of N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (P12FSI) is shown in Fig. 1. An appropriate amount of N-methylpyrrolidine was mixed with acetonitrile, and then bromoethane was added dropwise into the solution under an argon atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 24 h, and the solvent was removed by rotating evaporation. The as-obtained solid product was washed with ethyl ether three times and dried under vacuum at 70 °C for 48 h. Subsequently, the produced bromide and LiFSI were dissolved in deionized water with the molar ratio of 1 : 1.2. The as-obtained product was extracted with dichloromethane, and then washed with deionized water until there was no visible evidence of bromine in the water layer with the use of AgNO3. After removing dichloromethane by rotating evaporation, the products were dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 48 h to obtain N-ethyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (P12FSI). The 1H NMR characterization (Fig. S1) shows that the NMR spectrum of P12FSI is in good agreement with the expected structure.
Reaction route of P12FSI.
P(DADMA)-TFSI, P12FSI and LiTFSI were dissolved in acetone with different weight ratios of PIL/P12FSI, while keeping the amount of LiTFSI constant (20 wt%). The solution was stirred for 8 h and then cast onto PTFE slides. The as-obtained electrolyte membranes were dried at 80 °C under high vacuum for 48 h and then moved into an argon-filled glovebox for 24 h. It is necessary to tune the PIL/P12FSI weigh ratio to prepare ideal membranes, which have not only suitable mechanical characteristics but also desirable thermal and electrochemical performance. As observed, the transparent, dimensionally stable and crack-free membranes can be obtained when the PIL/P12FSI weigh ratio is higher than 40/60. The SPE samples are denoted with the weight ratio of PIL/P12FSI in percentage in square brackets and then followed by the weight percentage of LiTFSI in the PIL/P12FSI/LiTFSI system, i.e. [PIL/P12FSI]/LiTFSI. Therefore, the three as-prepared samples are denoted as [50/50]/20, [60/40]/20 and [70/30]/20, respectively. The thickness of the SPE samples is about 300 μm.
Measurements
The chemical structure of P12FSI was examined by the 1H NMR (Avance III400) experiment.
The water content in the SPE samples was measured by using an automatic Karl Fischer coulometric titrator (Metrohm 831) with an 860 KF Thermoprep.
The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy measurement was carried out with a Spectrum 100 (Perkin Elmer, Inc.) FT-IR spectrometer.
The mechanical properties of the SPE membranes were tested with a universal electromechanical tester (Instron 4465) with a tensile speed of 0.5 mm min−1.
A field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Nova NanoSEM 450) and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, Edax Apollo XP) were used to investigate the morphology and elemental distributions of the samples.
A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, TA Q2000) was employed to investigate the thermal behavior of the samples between −80 °C and 220 °C. The SPE samples were sealed in aluminum pans and then cooled and heated under a nitrogen atmosphere at a rate of 10 °C min−1.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the samples were conducted from 5° to 80° with a rate of 6° min−1 using a Rigaku D/max-2200 with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å).
Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Q5000IR, TA Instruments) scans were carried out from room temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere.
The ionic conductivity of the SPE samples was measured by AC impedance spectroscopy measurements over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an amplitude of 5 mV at the temperature range between 25 °C and 100 °C using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. The ionic conductivity (σ) of the SPE samples was calculated using the following equation:1where L, Rb and S are the thickness, bulk ohmic resistance and area of the electrolytes, respectively.
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out at 40 °C at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 using a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. The cell for the LSV measurement was assembled by sandwiching the SPE membrane between a stainless steel (working electrode) and a lithium foil (reference and counter electrodes).
The lithium ion transference number (tLi+) of the SPE samples was tested by chronoamperometry and AC impedance spectroscopy measurements at different temperatures (25 °C, 40 °C and 80 °C) using the method of Bruce et al.37 In the chronoamperometry measurement, a polarization voltage (ΔV) of 10 mV was applied to the symmetrical Li/SPE/Li cell, and the initial current I0 and the steady-state current Is were recorded. AC impedance spectroscopy was employed before and after polarization to detect the initial and the steady-state interfacial resistances, R0 and Rs. The lithium ion transference number (tLi+) could be calculated by2
The periodic charge–discharge cycling test of the symmetrical Li/SPE/Li cell was carried out at different temperatures (25 °C, 40 °C and 80 °C) at different current densities (0.1 mA cm−2, 0.2 mA cm−2) (1 h charge and 1 h discharge) using a cell test instrument (Land CT2001A).
The LiFePO4 electrodes were fabricated from a slurry of carbon coating LiFePO4 (Jiangsu Litian Co., Ltd.), acetylene black and PVDF (weight ratio 80 : 10 : 10) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The loading of active material was 1.5–2.0 mg cm−2. CR2016-type coin cells were assembled by contacting a LiFePO4 electrode, the SPE membrane and a lithium foil in sequence in an argon-filled glovebox. The Li/SPE/LiFePO4 cells were tested between 2.5 and 4.0 V in a wide temperature range (25 °C, 40 °C and 80 °C). The current rate was determined using a nominal capacity of 170 mA h g−1 for Li/LiFePO4 batteries.
