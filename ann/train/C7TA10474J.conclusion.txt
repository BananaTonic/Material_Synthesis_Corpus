Conclusions
The binary electrolyte of EMIMBF4–GBL is proposed for the use of an electrolyte in graphene-based EDLC for seeking excellent low temperature performance. The strong interaction of GBL with ions of EMIMBF4 characterized by NMR and ATR-IR result in significant decrease of Tg, viscosity and increase of ionic conductivity compared to PC. The viscosity of binary electrolyte can be quantitatively established by using the VTF equation. Stable low temperature range can be expanded to −70 °C using EMIMBF4–GBL. A model electrode of graphene exhibits a capacitance of 131 F g−1 and an energy density of 61.3 W h kg−1 at −70 °C, the best performance reported so far. The high operating voltage of 3.7 V and the great cycle performance suggest that EMIMBF4–GBL mixture is a competitive electrolyte for next generation super-capacitor with high energy density.
