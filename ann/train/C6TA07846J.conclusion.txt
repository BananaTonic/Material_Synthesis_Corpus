4.Conclusions
In summary, a novel high performance MPE was prepared from a PAEK/PAEK-g-PEG polymer membrane matrix and a chitosan-incorporating LiClO4 gel aqueous electrolyte. The synthesized MPE exhibited an ionic conductivity as high as ∼8 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Further, its liquid leakage rate was low while its thermal stability and mechanical strength were high. An S-EDLC fabricated using the synthesized MPE (S-EDLC-E2) exhibited a lower internal resistance, better cycling performance, and nearly the same energy and power densities as those of a double layer capacitor (EDLC-C0) fabricated using the same aqueous electrolyte and a commercial separator. Thus, it was concluded that the MPEs synthesized in this work are suitable for use in EDLCs. In addition, the MPEs can theoretically be also used in other energy storage systems as well as other applications.
