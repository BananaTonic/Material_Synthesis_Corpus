Experimental
Materials
LiBH4, decaborane, lithium foil, graphite, polyvinyl alcohol, and acetylene black were used as received and stored inside of an argon filled glovebox with oxygen and water levels below 1 ppm.
Li2B12H12 synthesis
A slight variation to the standard thermochemical synthesis of Li2B12H12 was used.34 LiBH4 (1.0 g) and decaborane (2.807 g) were loaded into a spex mill inside of a glovebox.34 A 10 : 1 ball to powder ratio was used with 2 mm stainless steel balls. The sample was spex milled for 5 minutes, then the vial was rotated 180 degrees and spex milled for an additional 5 minutes. The vial was taken back into the glovebox and homogenized with a mortar and pestle. The sample was loaded back into the spex mill vial and this was repeated until 45 minutes of total milling was achieved with sample homogenization inside of the glovebox after every 10 minutes of milling. This ensures a homogenous mixture with minimal heating during the process. Next, 0.3 g of the LiBH4–decaborane composite was loaded into a stainless steel reactor with a 3.5 mL volume and sealed with VCR gaskets (Fig. S1) in the glovebox. The reactor was then sealed inside a 500 mL volume Parr reactor and removed from the glovebox. The sample was heated to 200 °C and allowed to soak for 18–20 hours. All samples were collected and handled inside of the glovebox once at room temperature. This material is hereafter called the “as-synthesized” sample. The sample prepared by loading 1.0 g of the as-synthesized Li2B12H12 into a spex mill with a 30 : 1 ball to powder ratio and milling for 5 minutes is hereafter referred to as the “milled” sample. The milling vial was then rotated 180 degrees and spex milled for an additional 5 minutes (10 minutes of total milling). The sample was then collected inside of the glovebox and analyzed by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques.
Physical characterization
SEM images were acquired using a Hitachi SU8200 Series Ultimate Cold Field Emission SEM with varying accelerating voltages and magnifications. Powder and pressed pellets of the as-synthesized and milled samples were prepared in an Ar filled glovebox and contained in Ar filled containers until transfer into the instrument. Air exposure during sample insertion was approximately 5 seconds. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a Setaram SENSYS evo DSC using a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 with a constant flow of argon. The constant volume sample crucibles were sealed under argon in a glovebox.
Electrochemical characterization
Pellets of the materials were prepared by pressing the samples in a hydraulic press at 6 tons of pressure under inert conditions. Each pellet (85–130 mg) was 10 mm in diameter with a thickness between 0.8 and 1.1 mm. All electrochemical testing utilized a Swagelok-type cell. Electrochemical testing was performed using a Bio-Logic VMP3 multichannel potentiostat with a frequency response analyzer. Temperature-dependent studies were performed in an oven with the appropriate electrical connections. For the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and constant current cycling experiments, 10 mm diameter lithium foils were utilized in a symmetric cell setup. The EIS was measured in a frequency range of 1 MHz to 100 Hz. The conductivities were obtained from the diameter of a single arc and the intercept on the ZR axis in the complex impedance plots. Constant current cycling was performed in a symmetrical cell with 2 lithium foil electrodes (Li/Li2B12H12/Li) at a current of ±0.1 mA. Cyclic voltammetry was performed with a lithium foil electrode and a Pt disk electrode. The Li2B12H12 was pressed into a pellet with the Pt electrode, then the lithium foil electrode was attached to the opposite end (Li/Li2B12H12/Pt). All solid state cells were assembled by first preparing a composite anode consisting of SFG-10 graphite : Li2B12H12 : acetylene black (60 : 30 : 10 weight ratio). The components were hand mixed with a mortar and pestle. Then 2–5 mg of the composite anode material was then placed on top of a nickel foam disk inside of a 10 mm die set. Next, 110–130 mg of the milled Li2B12H12 was added on top of the anode composite/nickel foam and pressed at 6 tons to make a solid pellet. A lithium foil electrode was then added to the opposite end and put into a Swagelok type cell for cycling.
Photophysical characterization
The spectroscopic properties were obtained using an Agilent Technologies Cary 60 UV-vis and Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer. A stock solution of 5 mg mL−1 was prepared and then known amounts were added via a syringe to 2.5 mL of water in the cuvette and the concentrations calculated. Transparent head-up displays were prepared by dissolving 20–60 mg of Li2B12H12 in 60 g of water. Then 3.0 g of PVA (9000–10 000 MW; 80% hydrolyzed) was added with slow mixing. When the PVA is fully dissolved the solution is then poured onto a glass plate that has a 9′′ × 7′′ rectangle outlined by duct tape. The solution is allowed to dry naturally to form the film. In more concentrated solutions of Li2B12H12, Triton-X can be added to prevent aggregation of Li2B12H12 during the drying process.
