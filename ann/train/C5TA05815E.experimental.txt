3.Results and discussion
3.1.Crystal structure of LSFCr-3 perovskite
In our previous study,19 PXRD analysis of the LSFCr-3 oxide suggested that it was composed of a single perovskite phase containing no detectable impurities after firing at 1200 °C in air for 4 h. To obtain more structural information, the crystal structure of the LSFCr-3 material was further analyzed by Rietveld refinement in this study, with the profiles shown in Fig. 1(a). It is seen that LSFCr-3 actually has a hexagonal structure (R3̄c) with a = 5.4950(2) Å, c = 13.4369(9) Å, and a unit cell volume of 351.715 Å3. The profile R-value (Rp), weighted-profile R-value (Rwp), and the Durbin–Watson parameter of the refined structure parameters were 6.3%, 8.5% and 1.325, respectively, indicating that the refinement results are acceptable.

The inset shows the idealized crystal structure of LSFCr-3; (b) shows the in situ XRD patterns of LSFCr-3 in air at 300–900 °C in the 2θ ranges of 31–34° and 45–48°, while (c) shows the resulting hexagonal lattice parameters (a and c, displayed in (c)-1 and (c)-2) and the unit cell volume (displayed in (c)-3) as a function of temperature. For comparison, linear thermal expansion data, measured by dilatometry in our previous study,19 are displayed in (c)-4.
To serve as a cathode material for SOFCs, an electrode must be stable during heating, operation, and cool-down. Therefore, to track the phase evolution of LSFCr-3 with respect to temperature, in situ high temperature PXRD measurements were carried out from room temperature to 900 °C. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the hexagonal structure was maintained at temperatures up to 900 °C, since no splitting was observed for the characteristic (110) and (024) peaks in the 2θ range of 31–34° and 45–48°, respectively. In addition, a shift of the (110) and (024) diffraction peaks toward lower angles is seen, suggesting an increase in the cell parameters with increasing temperature.
Fig. 1(c) displays the thermal expansion curves of the cell parameters (a, c and unit cell volume), resolved by refining the corresponding PXRD patterns at various temperatures. For comparison, the linear thermal expansion data, obtained by dilatometry (d-LTEC) in our previous study, are also included.19 The TECs in selected temperature ranges were calculated from both the d-LTEC and in situ PXRD data. As can be seen in Table 1, the two sets of data match each other fairly well, with the TEC values obtained from d-LTEC being between those calculated from the lattice parameters a and c.

This reveals an anisotropic thermal expansion behavior of the LSFCr-3 perovskite, which cannot be detected by dilatometry measurements. Extensive work on La1−xSrxFeO3−δ perovskite materials has shown that the chemical expansion induced by the reduction of Fe cations at high temperatures is the primary cause of this anisotropic expansion characteristic.23 The anomalous slope change (at ∼475 °C) in Fig. 1(c)-4 also provides evidence of the chemical expansion of the LSFCr-3 material. Given the above considerations, the thermal expansion behavior of the LSFCr-3 perovskite is due to “pure” thermal expansion and chemical expansion, which can be distinguished by the anisotropic expansion of the crystal lattice.
3.2.Stoichiometry of LSFCr-3 perovskite
In our previous study, the chemical (structural) stability, thermal expansion, electrical conductivity, and electrocatalytic properties of La0.3Sr0.7Fe1−xCrxO3−δ (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3, respectively) were investigated over a wide range of pO2 values and temperatures. The trade-offs between these characteristics have led to the identification of the LSFCr-3 material as having the optimum composition within the La0.3Sr0.7Fe1−xCrxO3−δ family (when x &gt; 0.33, impurity peaks corresponding to the SrCrO4 phase appear).19 Considering that Cr can evaporate during high temperature annealing, it was necessary to determine the stoichiometry of LSFCr-3 in the as-synthesized form (after annealing at 1200 °C for 2 h in air). For this purpose, the cation stoichiometry of the LSFCr-3 oxide was determined by ICP-MS analysis, giving a compositional formula of La0.34(1)Sr0.66(8)Fe0.70(0)Cr0.29(3). This result is consistent with what was expected from the nominal composition (La1/3Sr2/3Fe0.7Cr0.3) and rules out the possibility of extensive Cr evaporation during the calcination process.
In order to then determine the anion stoichiometry (δ values) and obtain the exact chemical composition of the LSFCr-3 oxide at various temperatures, TG analysis was carried out in air, with the results shown in Fig. 2. An obvious weight loss commences at approximately 400 °C, which is generally in agreement with the temperature corresponding to the anomalous slope change in Fig. 1(b)-4. This result implies that the B-site cations in the LSFCr-3 perovskite start to be thermally reduced at 400 °C. The δ value at room temperature (δ0), determined by iodometric titration, was 0.1 for the as-synthesized sample in air, while it gradually increases with temperature and reaches a value of 0.19 at 800 °C. Therefore, the stoichiometries of the LSFCr-3 perovskite were confirmed to be La0.34Sr0.67Fe0.70Cr0.29O2.9 and La0.34Sr0.67Fe0.70Cr0.29O2.81 at room temperature (RT) and 800 °C, respectively.

3.3.Oxidation state of B-site cations (Fe and Cr) in LSFCr-3 perovskite
Mössbauer spectroscopy is unique in its sensitivity to subtle alterations in the chemical environment of a nucleus, such as oxidation state changes. This technique, which was carried out at room temperature, is also able to selectively indicate the oxidation state of cations in the bulk of solid materials using gamma-ray sources, especially for Fe cations.24Fig. 3 shows the room temperature Mössbauer spectrum of the LSFCr-3 powder and its Lorentzian profile fit. The resulting parameters after peak fitting, including the isomer shift (IS), peak attribute, peak area and molar fraction of Fe cations, are displayed in the inset. The spectrum profile is similar to what was reported for the La1−xSrxFeO3 (x = 0.7–0.9) compounds at 295 K, and corresponds to a paramagnetic phase, with the spectrum easily fitted by two singlets.25

The oxidation state of Fe can be determined by the observed range of the IS values. The IS value for high-spin Fe2+, Fe3+, Fe4+ and Fe6+ ions lies in the range of 0.6 to 1.7 mm s−1, 0.1 to 0.6 mm s−1, −0.2 to 0.2 mm s−1, and −0.8 to −0.9 mm s−1, respectively.24 In Fig. 3(a), the IS values of 0.064 and 0.39 mm s−1, associated with singlets, fall well within the characteristic range for Fe4+ and Fe3+, respectively, ruling out the presence of Fe2+ in the bulk of the LSFCr-3 perovskite. According to the peak areas of the singlet curves, the concentration of Fe4+ and Fe3+ is calculated to be 50.5% and 49.5%, respectively, at room temperature. The chemical formula of the LSFCr-3 material is thus, more correctly, La0.34Sr0.67(Fe3+0.346Fe4+0.354Cr3.4+0.29)O2.9, at room temperature, with the average valence of the Cr cation then being determined to be +3.4, based on the charge neutrality of this compound.
Theoretically, the +3.4 average oxidation state of Cr in the LSFCr-3 oxide could arise from any combination of Cr3+, Cr4+ and Cr6+, but with a majority of Cr3+ being present. Here, two combinations, Cr3+/Cr4+ and Cr3+/Cr6+, were assumed to be the majority species. According to the stoichiometry (0.29) and total charge (+0.968 = +3.4 × 0.29) associated with the Cr cation, its specific oxidation states and concentration were shown to be Cr3+0.174Cr4+0.116 and Cr3+0.257Cr6+0.033 for each combination. Consequently, the chemical formula of the LSFCr-3 material (in the bulk) is further suggested to be either La0.34Sr0.67(Fe3+0.346Fe4+0.354Cr3+0.174Cr4+0.116)O2.9 or La0.34Sr0.67(Fe3+0.346Fe4+0.354Cr3+0.257Cr6+0.033)O2.9 at room temperature.
In order to then determine the oxidation state of the B-site cations at SOFC operating temperatures, in situ high temperature XPS measurements were performed on the dense LSFCr-3 samples from room temperature to 700 °C. The low resolution survey scan spectra (Fig. S1, ESI) show the presence of the elements in the LSFCr-3 material at each temperature from the La3d5/2, Fe2p, Cr2p, Sr3d, O1s and C1s photoelectron energies, respectively. The C1s peak was assigned to adventitious carbon and was used to calibrate the experimentally obtained binding energies.
The result of the XPS survey spectrum analysis is in good agreement with the elementary composition of the oxide material. The height of the peaks associated with the LSFCr-3 phase at elevated temperatures is larger than that at room temperature. This was attributed to the progressive desorption of adventitious carbon at high temperatures, which is consistent with the reduction in the height of the C1s peak at 285 eV.
Fig. 4 shows the high resolution O1s, Fe2p and Cr2p spectra, collected from room temperature to 700 °C. The XPS spectra of La3d5/2 and Sr3d are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI), indicating a constant oxidation state of both of these elements, as expected, and only a subtle change with increasing temperature is seen.26 In contrast, the O1s peak changes notably when the temperature increases from RT to 300 °C, with peak (1) at 531.47 eV becoming very weak at elevated temperatures. As reported previously,27 the O1s peak at 528.70 eV is attributed to normal lattice oxygen (OL) in the perovskite structure, corresponding to peak (2) in Fig. 4(a). In addition, the O1s peaks at 530.50, 531.45, and 532.35 eV are assigned to chemisorbed oxygen (OC) in the forms of O2−, O− and O2−, respectively. These generally correspond to peak (1) in Fig. 4(a) and were derived from the trapping of mobile electrons of LSFCr-3 ceramic by absorbed molecular oxygen and dissociated oxygen atoms.

Therefore, the decreasing intensity of peak (1) indicates a marked decrease in the OC concentration on the LSFCr-3 surface with elevated temperatures. This result implies that the concentration of mobile electrons (charge carriers) in the LSFCr-3 material decreases significantly with increasing temperature. This is consistent with our previous work on the electrical conducting behavior of this material and also infers a relationship between the chemical state of oxygen on the surface and the electrical nature of ceramic.19
It was difficult to quantitatively interpret the Fe2p peaks due to the small chemical shift of only 0.5 eV between Fe3+ and Fe4+.28 The satellite peaks of Fe2p3/2 (≈718.40 eV) are clearly distinguishable in all of the spectra, while the binding energy is sensitive to the oxidation state of the Fe cation. As reported by other researchers,29,30 a satellite peak at approximately 8.0 eV above the primary Fe2p3/2 peak is characteristic of an Fe3+ species, while a satellite peak at approximately 6.0 eV above the Fe2p3/2 peak is characteristic of Fe2+. These data thus indicate that there is a small amount of Fe2+ on the surface of the LSFCr-3 material at all temperatures. Combining all of the results (oxidation state of the Fe cation) for the bulk of the perovskite, obtained by Mössbauer spectroscopy, with the XPS surface analysis data, it can be concluded that the Fe cations are present primarily as Fe3+ and Fe4+ from the surface through to the bulk of the LSFCr-3 material.
The Cr2p peaks in Fig. 4(c) suggest that at least two distinct valence states of Cr are present on the surface of LSFCr-3, with the Cr2p3/2 spectra clearly splitting into two peaks at all temperatures. Based on the binding energy of Cr cations in a range of Cr compounds in the literature,31,32 the Cr2p3/2 peak at 579.94 eV is attributed to Cr6+, while the Cr2p3/2 peak at 577.20 eV is assigned to Cr3+ (or Cr4+).
As the temperature increases, a change in the intensity of both the Cr6+ and Cr3+ (Cr4+) peaks is seen in Fig. 4(c). However, these need to be fitted to allow for quantitative analysis. Fig. 5 shows the typical fitting pattern of the Cr2p peak for the LSFCr-3 sample collected at 500 °C using a step size of 0.1 eV (Fig. S3 shows the fitting patterns at room temperature, 300 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C). The sample was kept at each temperature for 4 h prior to the measurements. The Shirley Algorithm was used to estimate the background of the spectra and a Gaussian–Lorentzian line shape GL(30) was employed to fit the XPS peaks. The area ratio of the Cr2p3/2 and Cr2p1/2 peaks should be 2 : 1, based on the multiplicity of the state for p electrons.33

At room temperature, Table 2 shows that the atomic ratio of the Cr6+ to Cr3+ ions (or Cr4+) is approximately 1, implying that the concentration of Cr6+ on the surface of the LSFCr-3 perovskite is much higher than it is in the bulk, which was shown by Mössbauer spectroscopy to be &lt; 0.1 (Cr3+0.174Cr4+0.116 or Cr3+0.257Cr6+0.033). This can be explained by (1) the formation of a thin layer of the SrCrO4 phase, which cannot be detected by XRD, on the surface of the LSFCr-3 material, or (2) the Cr species are stabilized in the 6+ oxidation state at the LSFCr-3 perovskite surface. As the temperature increases to 500 °C, the amount of Cr6+ gradually increases with increasing pO2 in the XPS chamber, as expected. The pO2 values were calculated as a function of temperature, using the pressure within the XPS heating chamber.

The observed decrease in the Cr6+ content with increasing temperature can be attributed to oxygen loss, accompanied by the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+(Cr4+) on the surface of the LSFCr-3 perovskite. Furthermore, as can be seen in Table 2, the pO2 inside the XPS chamber at 500–700 °C is on the order of 10−10 atm, which is very low compared to the ca. 0.21 atm environment experienced by an operating SOFC cathode. However, for the XPS measurements, high vacuum conditions are normally required in order to be able to collect the electrons. Therefore, the results obtained by these in situ (high temperature) XPS measurements are suggested to represent the oxidation state of each element in the LSFCr-3 perovskite under severe cathodic polarization (high current operation), when the oxygen would be depleted at the active sites and its reduction rate would be diffusion controlled.
3.4.Electrical conductivity of LSFCr-3 perovskite
In our previous study, the electrical conductivity of the LSFCr-3 oxide was investigated as a function of temperature in air.19 Due to the relatively low mobility of oxygen anions (two or three orders of magnitude lower than that of the electron and holes), the measured electrical conductivity can be regarded as representative of the electronic conductivity.34 However, in order to understand the electro-catalytic activity of the LSFCr-3 cathodes, it is also very useful to know their ionic conductivity.
For this purpose, a Brouwer diagram of the LSFCr-3 perovskite was examined (Fig. 6), in which logarithmic plots of the equilibrium total conductivity versus the logarithm of pO2 at different temperatures are presented. The pO2 test range was selected to be within the structural stability limit of the LSFCr-3 perovskites, which was determined by in situ XRD studies in our previous work.19 Here, the complex character of the plots in Fig. 6 is suggested to reflect changes in the concentration of the various charge carriers as a function of pO2. At the high-pressure limit (10−6 to 1 atm), the data at various temperatures can be fitted to a straight line with a slope of ca. 1/6 (Table 3), indicating a predominantly p-type conducting behavior of LSFCr-3 in the high pO2 range.34 In the medium-pressure range (10−6 to 10−13 atm), it was difficult to obtain reliable data, due to the slow equilibration kinetics between the specimen and environment.

These types of minima in conductivity are typical of oxides when the pO2 variations at constant temperature result in nearly equal concentrations of electron- and hole-like carriers in the material.34 The presence of ionic current, which is almost pO2 independent at the low-pressure limit, is responsible for the smooth shape of the curve near the conductivity minima (Fig. 6). Based on these arguments, the experimental results near the conductivity minima were fitted approximately to the following equation:352σ = σi + σonpO2−1/4 + σoppO2+1/4where σi represents the oxygen ion contribution and σon and σop represent the electron and hole contributions to the total conductivity, respectively. The fitting parameters that enabled a satisfactory approximation of the experimental data are given in Table 3. The ionic conductivity of the LSFCr-3 specimens is in the range of 10−2 S cm−1 at 700–800 °C, which is comparable to that of the YSZ electrolyte.36
As is generally recognized, when pO2 varies from the high-pressure extreme to the low-pressure limit, there should be a significant increase in the number of oxygen vacancies in the perovskites, resulting in a change in ionic conductivity.34 Consequently, σi (Table 3) obtained at the low pO2 limit could be different from that for the LSFCr-3 perovskite under typical cathode operating conditions (high pO2 limit, 0.1–0.21 atm). An alternative way to precisely determine the ionic conductivity of the LSFCr-3 material is to measure the oxygen anion diffusion coefficient in air.
The DC conductivity relaxation technique was therefore employed for this purpose. Fig. 7(a) demonstrates the total electrical conductivity response between 700 and 800 °C upon abruptly changing the pO2 from 0.1 to 0.21 atm. During the oxidation step (when pO2 increases from 0.1 to 0.21 atm), oxygen anions are incorporated into the crystal lattice of the LSFCr-3 material, resulting in a transient increase in the oxygen stoichiometry (δ). This can be described by Fick's second law, where the value of the chemical diffusion coefficient, , is evaluated by non-linear-least-squares fitting of the conductivity relaxation data to the following equation:373where βn is obtained from eqn (4),4and where σ(0), σ(t) and σ(∞) represent the equilibrium total conductivity at t = 0 (initial), at time t (during the relaxation), and at t → ∞ (after reaching a new equilibrium state), respectively, k is the surface exchange coefficient, and l is the half thickness of the sample.37

The normalized relaxation profiles of the total conductivity and the fitting curves are shown in Fig. 7(b). From these results, the values of  and k at 700–800 °C were obtained and are displayed in Table 4. As can be seen, both  and k are found to increase with increasing temperature, agreeing well with what has been reported previously for many other mixed conducting perovskites.16,38

From an experimental point of view, the  values can be obtained as a function of temperature from thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. 8), then giving the γ and D*O values.

The ionic conductivity of any material can be calculated using the Nernst–Einstein eqn (7):397where zOF represents the electrical charge of 1 mole of oxygen ions and F is the Faraday constant. The resulting σO values for the LSFCr-3 material are 0.032, 0.011 and 0.004 S cm−1 at 800 °C, 750 °C and 700 °C, respectively, which are a little smaller than the values deduced from the Brouwer diagram at the low pO2 limit (Table 3).
In addition, it is seen that the σO and k values for the LSFCr-3 perovskite are comparable to those for high performance La1−xSrxCoyFe1−yO3−δ cathodes with a high Co content.38,40,41 This result rules out the formation of even a thin layer of SrCrO4 (in which Cr would be in the 6+ state) on the surface of the LSFCr-3 perovskite, as SrCrO4 is known to have poor electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen redox reaction.21 As has been generally recognized, the oxidation state of the B-site transition metal cations governs the electrocatalytic activity of perovskite-based cathodes. In terms of our analysis (Section 3.3) of the oxidation state of the B-site Fe and Cr cations (from the surface through to the bulk of the LSFCr-3 material), the rapid oxygen bulk diffusion and high surface exchange rate (Table 4) of the LSFCr-3 material are both assumed to be related primarily to the contribution of the Cr cations. These were shown above to be predominant in the 3+ and 4+ oxidation states in the bulk of LSFCr-3, as Cr has a strong preference for maintaining a 6-fold coordination with oxygen anions. This, in turn, causes disorder in the oxygen vacancy sub-lattice, which is stabilized by Fe ions (iron–oxygen tetrahedral), resulting in very good oxygen ionic conductivity (bulk diffusion) within the LSFCr-3 material.
On the surface of LSFCr-3, the Cr cation valence was shown to be unexpectedly high, with the atomic ratio of Cr6+ to Cr3+ (Cr4+) being approximately 1, even at 700 °C (Table 2). According to the oxidation state and coordination requirements of transition metal ions, Cr6+ can only be tetrahedrally coordinated by the oxygen anions,42 producing a large concentration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of LSFCr-3. In general, the more oxygen vacancies present, the more rapidly oxygen can be absorbed and dissociatively reduced on the surface, and then move into an oxide lattice for a given chemical potential driving force.43 Therefore, these segregated oxygen vacancies, caused by the formation of Cr6+ on the LSFCr-3 surface, are suggested to be responsible for the excellent k values (Table 4) observed. This is therefore the first time that a highly beneficial effect of Cr on the electrical characteristics of a perovskite-based mixed conductor (LSFCr-3) is being reported. Much more typically, Cr exhibits a harmful effect on these types of materials by lowering their oxygen ionic conductivity and chemically reacting with the A-site or B-site cations (e.g., Cr poisoning of some SOFC cathodes).44,45 In our future work, angle resolved XPS studies of LSFCr-3 thin films and density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be performed to obtain more insights into the mechanism of formation of the high oxidation state of Cr (Cr6+) on the surface of our LSFCr-3 material.
Given the above considerations, it should not be surprising that the electrochemical performance of the LSFCr-3 cathode is superior (as reported previously19 and shown below) to what has been reported previously for LSCF with a low-Co content.20
3.5.Oxygen redox reaction at LSFCr-3 perovskites
The electrocatalytic activity of the LSFCr-3 material toward the oxygen redox reaction (oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, both occurring at the open circuit potential (OCP)) was determined by measuring the impedance of symmetrical half cells in air. Fig. 9 shows the impedance spectra of symmetrical LSFCr-3|LDC|LSGM|LDC|LSFCr-3 half-cells (where LSGM represents the La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3−δ electrolyte and LDC is La0.4Ce0.6O2−δ) at 750 °C in air at the OCP. The intercept of the impedance arcs with the real axis at high frequency corresponds to the ohmic resistance (Rohm) associated with the electrolyte, contact and leads, while the full diameter of the arcs corresponds to the polarization resistance (Rp), which is inversely proportional to the electrochemical reaction rates in the cell.46

To obtain more insight into the oxygen redox reaction at the LSCFr-3/electrolyte interface, a study of the influence of the pO2 and the applied DC bias on the electrode impedance was conducted at 750 °C (Fig. 10). It is well known that the oxygen redox reaction at mixed conducting electrodes involves many processes, such as gas diffusion, surface adsorption, gas dissociation, electron and ion transport, charge transfer at the interface, and so on. Each of these processes has a different dependence on pO2.47 The most commonly used approach to identify the rate-determining step (rds) in the oxygen redox reaction is to examine the slope of Rp as a function of oxygen partial pressure, following the relationship:488the n value is expected be 1, 1/2 or 1/4 if the molecular oxygen, atomic oxygen or electrons (charge transfer) are involved in the rds, respectively.48

As seen in Fig. 10(a), Rp gradually increases with decreasing pO2, giving a ca. pO21/4 dependency (n = 0.28). In addition, it can be clearly seen in Fig. 10(b) that Rp of the LSFCr-3-based half cells, obtained in air, decreases as the amplitude of the applied DC bias increases, indicating that the rds of the electrode reaction occurring in the cell is an electrochemical reaction, not a pure chemical, reaction.49,50 Consequently, the results obtained under varying pO2 and DC biases suggest that the rds of the oxygen redox reaction is the charge transfer process for the LSFCr-3 electrode at 750 °C in air.
To further analyze the OCP impedance data for the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction at 750 °C, the Nyquist plots of the LSFCr-3-based half-cell in air (Fig. 9) were fitted to an LRohm(R1Q1)(R2Q2) equivalent circuit model, where R1 represents the resistance of the charge transfer process (rds) at higher frequencies and R2, obtained from the low frequency arc, represents the O2 dissociation and mass transfer processes. L represents an inductance, seen only at very high frequencies and caused by the potentiostat and cables, while Q1 and Q2 represent constant phase elements. The impedance, ZQ, and the equivalent capacitance, C, of a Q parameter can be calculated according to the following equations:51910where ω is the angular frequency and n is an exponent, where Q represents an ideal capacitor and an ideal resistor when n = 1 and n = 0, respectively. When 0 &lt; n &lt; 1, this reflects the presence of inhomogeneities within the electrode system.
The electrode process corresponding to the high frequency (R1Q1) time constant has an equivalent capacitance of ca. 4.9 × 10−3 F cm−2, which is similar to that obtained in our previous work with La0.3Ca0.7Cr0.3Fe0.7O3−δ as an air electrode and is also in the typical range found for charge transfer processes at mixed conducting cathode materials.51–53 Further, the low frequency arc exhibits a capacitance value as large as 0.11 F cm−2, similar to what was obtained at a pO2 of 0.04 atm (Fig. 10(a)). A capacitance of this magnitude (&gt; 0.1 F cm−2) is not ascribable to an interfacial capacitance or adsorption on surfaces.54
To date, two processes have been reported to give such a large capacitance at low frequencies. One originates from the change of the oxygen non-stoichiometry in mixed conductors when the electrode potential is varied, i.e., when the bulk oxidation state of the transition metals changes, called a “chemical capacitance”.43 A second process that could give rise to such a large capacitance at low frequencies is oxygen gas diffusion,48 which could dominate the oxygen redox reaction when the cathode is starved of oxygen. As previously reported, the oxygen exchange reaction (chemical capacitance) is thermally activated, while gas diffusion should be almost temperature-independent. In recent parallel work, we have found that the low frequency resistance of LSFCr-3 has a pronounced temperature dependence, indicating that this feature is due to the change in the redox state (chemical capacitance), likely of the Fe component, within this MIEC oxide.55
3.6.Performance of LSFCr-3 cathodes in a Ni–Ce0.8Sm0.2O2−δ (SDC) supported cell
In order to evaluate the cathode performance under more practical conditions, a LSFCr-3 cathode layer, with a thickness of approximately 20 μm, was deposited on a YSZ/SDC bi-layer electrolyte membrane supported by a Ni–SDC cermet. The fabrication process and microstructural characteristics of the resulting coin cells have been reported in our previous work.20
Fig. 11 shows the I–V and I–P characteristics of this anode-supported cell at 750 °C with a 3% H2O–H2/air environment at the anode/cathode. It can be seen that the cell exhibits a maximum power density of 0.81 W cm2, which is higher than that of well-known LSCF cathode-based cells (0.73 W cm2 in our previous work20) when using the same anode-supported configuration. Furthermore, our previous work demonstrated good long-term stability of the LSFCr-3 cathode under typical operating conditions.19 Therefore, the LSFCr-3 material is clearly a very promising and robust new cathode material for SOFC applications.
