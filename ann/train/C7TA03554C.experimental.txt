2.1Materials
3,3′-Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Suzhou Yacoo Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China) was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C prior to use. 4,4′-Dicarboxylic diphenyl ether (DCDPE, Changzhou Sunlight Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., China) was dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C before use. Methanesulfonic acid (MSA), phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (molecular weight (Mw) = 350 or 550) and PEG (Mw = 1000 or 10 000) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd and were used as received. Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6), ethylene carbonate (EC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC) were obtained from TCI Chemicals, Japan and were stored in the glove box and used without further purification. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), PVDF, and conductive agent (Super P carbon black) were purchased from Shanghai Xiaoyuan Energy Technology Ltd., and used as received.
2.2Synthesis of OPBI
OPBI was prepared using condensation polymerization of DAB and DCDPE in Eaton's reagent (P2O5/MSA = 1 : 10, w/w) at 140 °C for 1.5 h (as shown in Scheme S1).36 The resulting product, OPBI, exhibited a reduced viscosity of 3.54 dl g−1 at a polymer concentration of 0.5 g dL−1 in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 30 °C. Proton nuclear magnetic spectroscopy (1H-NMR) δ (ppm): 13.0 (2H, imidazole N–H), 8.30 (4H, Ar), 7.80 (2H, Ar), 7.70 (2H, Ar), 7.60 (2H, Ar), 7.30 (4H, Ar) (see Fig. S2).
2.3Preparation of porous OPBI membranes
A series of porous OPBI membranes were prepared using a blending phase inversion process from the OPBI solution with different PEG contents. The experimental details are described next.
OPBI (0.2 g) and PEG (1.0 g) were dissolved in 10 mL of DMSO to form a homogeneous solution. The polymer solution was cast onto a glass substrate and dried in an air oven at 80 °C for 8 h. The thickness of the blend membrane was controlled to about 20–30 μm. The resulting blend membrane was soaked in deionized water at 60 °C for 48 h to remove the PEG component followed by drying in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 10 h to yield the dry porous OPBI membrane.
2.4Preparation of cathodes
The cathode was prepared using the following process: to a glass bottle were added 1.000 g of LiFePO4, 0.125 g of Super P, 2.5 g of 5 wt% PVDF/NMP solution and 2.0 g of NMP. The suspension mixture was stirred magnetically at room temperature for 5 h and subsequently underwent ultrasonic treatment for 30 min. The resulting homogenous slurry was cast onto aluminum foil and the paste thickness was controlled at ∼100 μm by using a scraper. The slurry was dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 10 h and finally cut into round electrodes of 12 mm in diameter with a mold for use in the next step which was coil cell assembly.
2.5Measurements
The microscopic morphology of the OPBI porous membranes were investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI, USA). The porosities of the OPBI porous membranes were calculated using the following equation:where ρ and ρ0 (1.3 g mL−1) are the densities of OPBI porous membrane and OPBI dense membrane, respectively. The tensile strength and Young's moduli of various membranes were measured using a universal test machine (Instron 4465, Instron, USA) at a crosshead speed of 4 mm min−1. The wettability of the porous membranes was measured by placing a droplet of EC/DEC (1 : 1, v/v) or water onto the membrane surfaces and the contact angle was recorded (DSA30, KRÜSS, Germany). Electrolyte uptake (EU) measurement was performed by immersing a sheet of the membrane (∼0.1 g) into electrolyte [1.0 mol L−1 LiPF6 in EC/DEC (1 : 1 v/v)] at room temperature for 1 h in an argon filled glove box. The EUs of the membranes are calculated from the following equation:where W and W1 refer to the weights of the membrane before and after soaking, respectively, in the liquid electrolyte at room temperature for 1 h.
Glass transition temperature (Tg) measurement was performed using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, Pyris-1, PerkinElmer, USA) from room temperature to 240 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 in nitrogen. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in nitrogen with a thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA Q5000, TA Instruments, USA) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1. The thermal shrinkage test was performed by putting the porous membranes in an air oven (101C-3B, Shanghai Experimental Instrument Factory, China) at various temperatures (100, 150, and 200 °C), for 1 h at each temperature.
Ionic conductivity was measured using a four-point probe electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique over a frequency range from 100 Hz to 100 kHz (HIOIKI 3532-40, Japan). A membrane sheet (19 mm in diameter) filled with electrolyte was sandwiched between two lithium sheets and then assembled in a CR2016 coin cell. The ionic conductivity was calculated from the following equation:where d, S and Rb refer to membrane thickness, area of the lithium sheet and cell resistance, respectively.
The CR2016 coin cells were assembled in an argon filled glove box by sandwiching a liquid electrolyte filled separator between a cathode (round LiFePO4 electrode, see Section 2.4) and an anode (round lithium foil, 12 mm in diameter). The charge–discharge capacities of the cells were measured using a battery tester (CT2001A, LAND, China) in the voltage range of 2.4–4.3 V at a rate of 0.1C. The cycle performance test was carried out at a rate of 0.1C for four cycles and a rate of 1C for eighty cycles. The rate performance test was carried out at 0.1, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5C successively and then finally reverting to 1C.
