Materials
Tetrahydrofuran (THF, HPLC grade, Honeywell) was dried over molecular sieves (Acros; 4 Å, 8–12 mesh) before use. Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO, Sigma-Aldrich, Mn = 20 kg mol−1, MwMn−1 = 2.3), n-butyllithium (n-BuLi, 2.5 M, solution in hexanes, Acros), dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), chloroform-d (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,6-dibromohexane (98%, Acros), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, reagent grade, Acros), trimethyl amine (TMA, 7.3 M aq. solution, Acros), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-butanediamine (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), iodomethane (99%, Sigma-Aldrich), diethyl ether (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium nitrate (99%, Sigma), sodium bromide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich), methanol (MeOH, HPLC grade, Honeywell) and 2-propanol (IPA, HPLC grade, Honeywell) were all used as received. Silver nitrate (99.995%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dried under vacuum in the dark before use.
Polymer synthesis
The different polymers were prepared using an approach in which a family of tertiary α,ω-diaminoalkanes and 1,6-dibromohexane were successively employed to build up the target side chains from bromoheptyl functionalized PPO backbones, as outlined in Scheme 1. The IEC values of the final materials were controlled by the degree of bromoalkylation of the PPO precursor. The number of QA cations per side chains was varied by the number of sequential quaternization reactions. The samples containing 2, 3 and 4 QA cations per side chain were designated as PPO-7QnQ-IEC, PPO-7QnQnQ-IEC and 7QnQnQnQ-IEC, respectively, where n is the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain between 2 adjacent QA cations, and IEC is the value of the material in the OH− form.
Synthetic pathways of the various PPOs functionalized with polyionic side chains having different numbers of methylene units in between the QA cations (Series 1, PPO-7QnQ-IEC with n = 2, 3, 4 and 6), different IEC values (Series 2, PPO7Q6Q-IEC with IEC = 1.5, 1.8, 1.9 and 2.0 meq. g−1) and different numbers of QA cations per side chain (Series 3, PPO-7Q6Q-1.9, PPO-7Q6Q6Q-1.9 and PPO-7Q6Q6Q6Q-1.9).
Precursor bromoheptyl PPOs with a degree of bromination of 10, 11, 15, 17, 19, and 29% (DB, percentage of bromoalkylated repeating units of the PPO) were prepared via lithiation of PPO and reaction with 1,6-dibromohexane, as described previously.13 The value of DB was controlled by the degree of lithiation, and the samples were designated as PPO-7Br-DB. Here follows a description of the synthesis of PPO-7Br-11. A 4-neck 500 mL round bottomed flask attached to an argon/vacuum line and fitted with a rubber septum and a thermometer was charged with native PPO (4 g, 33.29 mmol repeat units) and dry THF (400 mL). After dissolution under stirring, the solution was first degassed 3 times, heated to 60 °C and then kept for about 40 min to completely dissolve the PPO. The homogeneous solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and was then degassed using 7 vacuum–argon cycles. Subsequently, a few droplets of n-Buli were added until the solution turned faintly yellow in order to consume remaining impurities. Next, 10 mL of n-BuLi (25 mmol) were slowly added drop-wise to the solution, which quickly turned yellow to indicate the formation of lithiated PPO. The reaction was left to proceed at room temperature under stirring for 3 h during which time the solution turned orange-red. The solution was then cooled to −70 °C in an isopropanol-dry ice bath, and a 200% molar excess of 1,6-dibromohexane was quickly added all at once to quench the lithiated sites. The color of the solution immediately turned light yellow to indicate that the alkylation reaction had occurred. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight under stirring to obtain a colorless solution. Next, the product was precipitated in methanol to isolate a fine white powder which was washed extensively with methanol and then dried under vacuum for 2 days to a constant weight. In all the bromoalkylation reactions, the yield was approximately 100% and no gel formation was detected in any of the products.
The synthesis of the four samples in Series 1 (PPOs having side chains with two QA cations with n = 2, 3, 4 and 6, respectively) was carried out by the reaction of PPO-7Br-15 with N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,4-butanediamine, and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine, respectively. This reaction was followed by a reaction with iodomethane to produce the di-quaternized side chains (Scheme 1). As an example, the synthesis of sample PPO-7Q2Q-1.9 is as follows. An amount of 0.8 g of PPO-7Br-15 (0.78 mmol of Br) was first dissolved in 16 g NMP. The polymer solution was then added drop-wise to N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (1.3 mL, 8.58 mmol, 1000% excess) and kept at 60 °C for 3 days under stirring. The homogeneous orange-red solution was poured into diethyl ether to precipitate the intermediate as a light yellow powder which was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 2 days. In the next step, a 5 wt% solution of the polymer in NMP was prepared and a 200% excess of iodomethane was added. The reaction solution was kept in the dark and under stirring at 40 °C for 2 days in order to fully quaternize the terminal amine groups of the side chains. Subsequently, the orange-red solution was poured into diethyl ether to precipitate the final product. The yellow powder was carefully washed with diethyl ether, filtered out and dried under vacuum at room temperature. In order to obtain the pure Br− form of the polymer, the powder was immersed in 200 mL of 1 M aq. NaBr for 2 days at 50 °C under stirring. Next, the polymer was washed extensively with de-ionized water and finally dried under vacuum at room temperature for 2 days before further use. The four samples in Series 2 (PPOs having side chains with two QA cations spaced by 6 carbon atoms) were prepared in a similar way using N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine instead of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine, and different PPO-7Br-DB precursors to obtain IEC values between 1.5 and 2.0 meq. g−1.
The synthesis of the four samples in Series 3 (PPOs carrying side chains containing 1, 2, 3 and 4 QA cations, respectively, with n = 6) was carried out in a similar way to that in Series 1 and 2, however using sequential quaternizations involving N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine and 1,6-dibromohexane. The synthesis of sample PPO-7Q-1.8 with one QA cation per side chain has been described previously.13,14 Here, an example is given for the synthesis of PPO-7Q6Q6Q-1.9 in three reaction steps. To perform the first step, 0.8 g of PPO-7Br-11 (0.61 mmol of Br) was dissolved in 16 g of NMP. The solution was added drop-by-drop into N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-1,6-hexanediamine (1.46 mL, 6.71 mmol) and the resulting solution was kept at 60 °C under stirring for 3 days. The orange solution was poured into diethyl ether to precipitate the first intermediate (designated as PPO-7Q6N). After careful washing in diethyl ether, the intermediate was collected by filtration and dried at room temperature for 2 days. In order to carry out the second step, a 5 wt% solution of PPO-7Q6N in NMP was prepared and slowly added to 1,6-dibromohexane (1.08 mL, 6.71 mmol). The solution was kept at 60 °C under stirring for 3 days to produce the second intermediate (designated as PPO-7Q6Q6Br). This product was precipitated in diethyl ether, filtered out, and dried under vacuum at room temperature for 2 days. In the third reaction step, PPO-7Q6Q6Br was dissolved in NMP to form a solution containing approximately 3 wt% polymer, before adding a 200% excess of trimethylamine. The solution was kept at 40 °C under stirring for 4 days to produce the final product. In order to obtain the pure Br− form, the final product was first precipitated in diethyl ether, then filtered out and extensively washed with diethyl ether, again filtered, and finally dried under vacuum at room temperature until a constant weight was obtained.
Structural characterization
1H-NMR spectra were collected using a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer, operating at 400.13 MHz, using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 solutions of the polymers. The Mn and Mw values of the bromoalkylated PPOs were measured by employing a size-exclusion chromatograph system combining a series of three Shodex gel columns (KF-805, -804 and -802.5) and a refractive index detector. For calibration, polystyrenes with low polydispersities (Mn = 650 kg mol−1 from Water Associates, and Mn = 96 and 30 kg mol−1 from Polymer Laboratories, and Mn = 3.18 kg mol−1 from Agilent Technologies) were employed. Dry samples were dissolved in 2 mL of HPLC-grade chloroform and filtered (pore size 0.45 μm). SEC measurements were then performed at room temperature using HPLC-grade chloroform as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1.
Membrane preparation
An amount of 0.15 g polymer in the Br− form was first dissolved in 3 g of NMP at room temperature under stirring. The homogeneous solution was carefully poured onto a Petri dish with a diameter of 5 cm and placed in a well-ventilated casting oven at 80 °C for 48 h to complete the casting. The tough, transparent yellow AEM was removed from the Petri dish by immersion in water, washed several times, and stored in de-ionized water at room temperature before further analysis. The average thickness of the wet membranes was ∼60 μm. To convert the AEMs to the OH− form, the samples were fully immersed in 1 M aq. NaOH at room temperature for at least 48 h under nitrogen. In order to ensure complete conversion and removal of any traces of Br−, the NaOH solution was exchanged at least 3 times during the ion-exchange process.
Thermal characterization
The thermal stability of the polymers under a nitrogen atmosphere was studied using a TA instruments TGA Q500. The sample was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for at least 48 h until a constant weight was obtained. Subsequently, the sample was pre-heated at 150 °C for 10 min in the TGA furnace to remove possible traces of water before the data collection (pre-heating at 100 °C produced identical results, indicating no degradation at 150 °C). TGA data were then recorded between 50 and 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a constant nitrogen flow of 60 mL min−1. The thermal decomposition temperature (Td,95) was noted when the weight loss had reached 5%. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the bromoalkylated polymers was determined by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on a model Q2000 DSC analyzer from TA instruments. The upper temperature limit of the DSC experiment was set to 280 °C, based on the Td,95 values of the polymers. DSC analysis was performed during the thermal cycle: 20 → 280 → 50 → 280 °C.
Determination of ion exchange capacity and water uptake
From the 1H NMR data, the theoretical IEC (IECNMR) of the final quaternized polymers was calculated based on the DB of the respective PPO-7Br precursor polymer assuming full displacement of the Br atoms. The experimental IEC (IECtitr) of the AEMs was determined by Mohr titrations, as described here. The AEM sample in Br− form was dried under vacuum at 50 °C for at least 48 h. Next, 0.050 g of the sample was immersed in 0.2 M NaNO3 (25.00 mL) under stirring for 48 h to fully leach out all the free Br− ions from the polymer to the solution. A volume of 5.0 mL was extracted from the solution and then titrated with aq. AgNO3 (0.01 M) using K2CrO4 as the indicator. The titration was repeated at least 3 times to calculate an average value of IECtitr.
AEM samples in the Br− form were dried at 50 °C for at least 48 h to determine the dry weight (WBr). The dry weight in OH− form (WOH) was then precisely calculated using the value of the previously determined IECtitr and the dry weight WBr. In order to measure the wet weight in the OH− form, the dried membrane in Br− form was immersed in 200 mL of 1 M degassed aq. NaOH solution in a desiccator for at least 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The sample was then quickly transferred to a beaker containing 200 mL of de-ionized water and stored for at least 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The transfer/storage procedure was repeated 4–6 times until the wash water maintained neutral pH. Finally, the sample was stored in de-ionized water for at least 24 h to reach equilibrium at room temperature under nitrogen flow. The sample was taken out, wiped with tissue paper, and quickly weighed to determine W′OH. The water uptake (WUOH) was calculated as:1
Using a similar procedure, the water uptake was measured at 40, 60, and 80 °C by employing a heated 100 mL round-bottomed flask with an argon/vacuum inlet/outlet. The hydration number (λ), defined as the number of water molecules per functional group, was calculated as:2
Conductivity measurements
The OH− conductivity of the AEMs was determined by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a Novocontrol high resolution dielectric analyzer 1.01S in the frequency range 10−1 to 10−7 Hz at 50 mV. The membrane sample (1.4 cm × 1.4 cm) was placed in a closed glass vial containing 100 mL of 1 M aq. NaOH for at least 24 h under a nitrogen atmosphere to completely convert to the OH− form. In order to ensure complete conversion and removal of any traces of Br−, the NaOH solution was exchanged at least 3 times during the ion-exchange process.31 Next, the sample was transferred to a beaker containing 200 mL of degassed de-ionized water and stored for at least 2 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The transferring/storing procedure was repeated 4–6 times until the wash water remained neutral. The OH− conductivity values were determined using a two-probe method under fully immersed conditions during the thermal cycle: 20 → 80 → −20 → 80 °C.
Small angle X-ray scattering
The morphology of the AEMs was studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis. Membrane samples (2 cm × 0.5 cm) in the Br− form were first properly dried under vacuum at 50 °C. SAXS measurements were performed using a SAXSLab ApS instrument (JJ-Xray, Denmark) combined with a microfocus sealed X-ray tube and a Pilatus detector. The scattering vector (q) was calculated as:3where l is the wavelength of the CuK(α) radiation (1.542 Å) and 2θ is the scattering angle. The average distance between ionic clusters (d) in the AEMs was calculated as:4
Evaluation of alkaline stability
The stability of the membranes under alkaline conditions was studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy, as well as by IEC, OH− conductivity and thermal decomposition measurements.
Three weighed samples (∼10 mg) of each membrane were immersed in 350 mL of 1 M aqueous NaOH. The solutions were then degassed and left under nitrogen at 60 or 90 °C. The NaOH solution was exchanged at least 3 times during the test period. After 1, 4 and 8 days of immersion, respectively, samples were taken out, washed carefully with deionized water, and immersed in 1 M aq. NaBr at 60 °C for at least 48 h under stirring to obtain the Br− form. To remove any traces of other anions, the NaBr solutions were exchanged at least 3 times during the ion-exchange process. The samples were then extensively washed to remove any traces of NaBr and stored in deionized water under stirring for at least 24 h at room temperature. After drying at least 24 h at 50 °C under vacuum, the samples were analyzed by TGA and dissolved in DMSO-d6 with gentle heating for 1H NMR measurements.
For the conductivity measurements, samples were kept in a large excess of 1 M NaOH at 90 °C for 8 days, and each sample was then transferred to 100 mL of degassed 1 M aq. NaOH, and stored at room temperature for at least 24 h under nitrogen. The NaOH solution was replaced at least 3 times during the ion-exchange process. Next, the samples were washed intensively with degassed de-ionized water and kept in 100 mL degassed de-ionized water for at least 3 h. The washing and storing were repeated at least 5 times. Finally, the conductivity measurements at 90 °C were carried out under immersed conditions as described above.
Regarding the IEC measurements, samples were kept in a large excess of 1 M NaOH at 90 °C for 8 days under nitrogen. The samples were then washed intensively with de-ionized water before being immersed in 100 mL 1 M NaBr at 60 °C under stirring for 2 days. The NaBr solution was replaced at least 3 times during the ion-exchange process. Subsequently, each sample was washed intensively with degassed de-ionized water and kept in 200 mL degassed de-ionized water for 24 h before being dried at 50 °C for 2 days. The Mohr titrations were finally carried out as described above.
