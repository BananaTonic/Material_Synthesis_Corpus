4.Conclusions
A new family of three-arm imidazolium-based PILs (3P(MPBIm-X)) with low Tg was synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization and anion exchange reaction. Among them, PILs with TFSI− anion present the most frequent segment movement, best thermal stability and highest ionic conductivity. Furthermore, we fabricated a new class of safety-reinforced, wide electrochemical window and thin 3P(MPBIm-TFSI)-based SLCE for flexible polymer lithium batteries. It was demonstrated that such hybrid electrolyte exhibit high ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 50 °C, good IL retention properties and wide electrochemical window (4.8 V). SLCE could be thermally stable up to 370 °C and flame-retardant when exposed to ignition source. In addition, cells with SLCE possessed good efficiency and fine security even in high temperature environment. Li/SLCE/LiFePO4 cell showed high discharge capacity of 151 mA h−1 at 50 °C and 162 mA h g−1 at 80 °C with excellent discharge capacity retention at both medium and high temperatures. Moreover, Li/LiFePO4 pouch cell can function well even at deformable condition without inner short circuit when SLCE was applied as the electrolyte. Thus, we believe that the exquisite SLCE reported here can be suggested as an advanced electrolyte to outperform conventional flammable carbonate-based liquid electrolytes and boost the development of large scale polymer lithium batteries with shape diversity.
