Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated an easily operative cost effective synthetic method for bulk production of RGs at low temperature (160 Â°C) in a time span of only 14 min with the aid of formic acid having excellent physical properties. Less energy consuming and large scale production of mesoporous RGs with high surface area and excellent electrical conductivity enables this study for commercial viability of RGs, having applications in the fields of batteries, catalysis, sensors, and supercapacitors. It is important to mention that in this work, we synthesized two different reduced graphene samples where GOs were synthesized with and without addition of NaNO3. The results presented here show that reduced graphene prepared from GO without the addition of NaNO3 had better properties such as higher conductivity and higher specific capacitance due to the presence of lesser functional groups. Finally, it is worth mentioning that well known fundamental organic chemistry reactions between oxygen functional groups of GO and formic acid were the key behind the success of this work.
