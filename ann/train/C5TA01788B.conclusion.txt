Conclusions
In summary, this study presents a simple and facile route to low-oxygen GNs with high conductivity. It has been demonstrated that the presence of low-content oxygen drastically changes the exfoliation rule of low-oxygen GNs in various solvents. The resultant GNs can be well dispersed in most polar solvents suitable for investigation of their chemical properties and fabrication of transparent conductive films and high-rate supercapacitors via all-solution approaches. Compared to GO counterparts, low-oxygen GNs exhibit other significant advantages, such as improved chemical and thermal stability in aqueous solution, enhanced conductivity of thermal-annealing films, the opening of the bandgap, and excellent electrochemical capacitance. This novel approach to low-oxygen GNs would open up a new window for graphene chemistry and be of practical significance for flexible design of future nanoelectronics based on GNs and mass production of graphene-based functional composite materials. Wishfully, more novel attributes of low-oxygen GNs will be explored in future.
