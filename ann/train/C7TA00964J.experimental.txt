Experimental
Materials
4-Fluorobenzonitrile, 4-methoxyphenol and 1,1,1-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane (THPE) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Dry solvents and other reagents were obtained locally. These chemicals were used without further purification.
Physical measurements
The IR spectra were recorded by using a NICOLET 6700 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets in the 400–4000 cm−1 range. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer STA 6000 TGA analyser under a N2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Gas adsorption measurements were performed using a BelSorp-max instrument from Bel Japan.
X-ray structural studies
Single-crystal X-ray data of mono-1 were collected at 100 K on a Bruker KAPPA APEX II CCD Duo diffractometer (operated at 1500 W power: 50 kV, 30 mA) using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The crystal was mounted on nylon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) with Paraton-N (Hampton Research). The data integration and reduction were processed with SAINT12 software. A multi-scan absorption correction was applied to the collected reflections. The structure was solved by a direct method using SHELXTL13 and was refined on F2 using the full-matrix least-squares technique using the SHELXL-97 (ref. 14) program package within the WINGX15 programme. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. All hydrogen atoms were located in successive difference Fourier maps and they were treated as riding atoms using SHELXL default parameters. The structures were examined using the Adsym subroutine of PLATON16 to ensure that no additional symmetry could be applied to the models. The PLATON SQUEEZE programme was used to omit the diffused electron density associated with disordered solvent molecules to improve the % R.
Synthesis of PCF-1
A round bottom flask was charged with THPE (0.295 g, 0.96 mmol), 2,4,6-tris(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (TFPT) (0.5 g, 1.37 mmol) and potassium carbonate (1.5 g, 10.85 mmol). To this, dimethylacetamide (DMAc, 20 mL) was added under a nitrogen atmosphere and the mixture was heated to reflux gradually under stirring. The reaction was kept under these conditions for 24 hours (Scheme S1). An off-white coloured fibrous solid was obtained upon slow cooling which was washed with dimethylformamide (DMF) (×3), methanol (MeOH) (×3) and acetone (×2) and kept in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chloroform (CHCl3) mixture (1 : 1) for 24 hours to dissolve all monomers. The solid was filtered off and dried under vacuum at 110 °C to obtain the dry phase of PCF-1. Yield: 0.24 g.
Synthesis of PCF-1-SO3H
A reported protocol was followed for the sulphonation of PCF-1.10 A solution of chlorosulfonic acid (0.2 mL) in DCM (2.0 mL) was added dropwise to a dispersion of PCF-1 (0.15 g) in DCM (5.0 mL) at 0 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred under these conditions for 2 hours and then at room temperature for the following 24 hours (Scheme S2). The solid obtained was poured into n-hexane and further stirred in hot toluene for 8 hours. The mixture was then filtered off and the solid was dried under vacuum at 110 °C to obtain a yellow powder of PCF-1-SO3H. The yellow mass was then washed with water, dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), methanol, acetone and dichloromethane (DCM) repeatedly to get rid of unreacted Cl-SO3H. After that, solvent exchange was carried out with a THF and CHCl3 (1 : 1) mixture followed by desolvation at 110 °C under vacuum. Yield: 0.22 g.
Synthesis of monomer (mono-1)
A round bottom flask was charged with TFPT (0.5 g, 1.37 mmol), 4-methoxyphenol (0.51 g, 4.11 mmol) and potassium carbonate (1.13 g, 8.22 mmol). To this solid mixture, DMAc (25 mL) was added under a nitrogen atmosphere and the reaction was gradually heated to reflux. The stirring was continued for 24 hours under these conditions. Upon cooling, the mixture was concentrated under vacuum and the compound was extracted with DCM and washed with water several times (Scheme S3). The organic layer was then reduced in vacuo to yield an off-white powder of mono-1. The compound was recrystallized from DCM for further use (Fig. S4). Yield: 2.9 g.
