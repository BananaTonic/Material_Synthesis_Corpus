4.Conclusion
In summary, garnet-type ceramic c-LLZO nanofibers were prepared by simple electrospinning and subsequent sintering processes. The CPE was fabricated by the dispersion of LLZO nanofibers into a PVDF-HFP polymer. Incorporation of the LLZO nanofibers into the PVDF-HFP matrix has a significant effect on the overall performance of the CPEs. Since LLZO nanofibers with a 1D structure provide continuous Li-ion transport pathways and also decrease the crystallinity of the PVDF-HFP matrix, the PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI/LLZO CPE with 10 wt% LLZO nanofibers exhibited an enhanced ionic conductivity of 9.5 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature, which is much higher than that of the basic PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI CPE. Furthermore, this CPE exhibits a wide electrochemical window up to 5.2 V vs. Li/Li+. More importantly, this CPE showed excellent mechanical strength, which makes it more effective in suppressing Li dendrite growth. Finally, the cells assembled with this CPE achieved good cycling performance and rate capability. All these favorable features demonstrate that the developed PVDF-HFP/LiTFSI/LLZO CPE is promising to be used as the electrolyte in the next-generation solid-state Li batteries.
