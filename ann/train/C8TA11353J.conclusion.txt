3.Conclusions
In conclusion, we present an effective and feasible material design strategy to engineer the self-healing and mechanical properties of supramolecular polymers for diverse applications without requiring synthesis of new covalent structures. This design strategy was applied to produce a series of self-healing materials based on tunable non-covalent interactions between NDI and Py functionalities, and the resulting composites exhibit remarkable features: (1) high stiffness and good stretchability to help maintain physical integrity in devices; (2) widely tunable self-healing temperature and mechanical properties to satisfy various application requirements; (3) good ionic conductivity and high self-healing efficiency to provide durable ion-conductive pathways in potential electrochemical applications, especially the energy storage area. Moreover, our strategy to decouple crosslinking properties from the polymer structure is generally applicable, and we hope it will inspire further engineering of improved supramolecular systems for effective integration of self-healing behavior into real devices. We plan to explore specific implementations of our materials design in future publications.
