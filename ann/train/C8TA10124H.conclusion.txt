4.Conclusions
Novel PEO-n-UIO solid electrolytes were fabricated by dispersing lithium ion conducting nanoporous UIO/Li-IL fillers in the PEO matrix and applied in LiFePO4/Li solid-state batteries. Owing to the high ionic conductivity of the UIO/Li-IL fillers and the suppression of the PEO crystallinity by the UIO/Li-IL fillers, the ionic conductivities of the PEO-n-UIO solid electrolytes are greatly enhanced; the conductivities of the PEO-n-UIO solid electrolytes can reach &gt;10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C. Moreover, the nanostructured UIO/Li-IL fillers improve the stability of the PEO matrix against the lithium electrode; as a result, the current density for stable Li plating/stripping in the PEO-n-UIO solid electrolytes increases to 500 μA cm−2. The multifunctional UIO/Li-IL fillers enable better performances of the solid-state lithium batteries; the discharge capacity of the battery is ∼151 mA h g−1 and remains at 144 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.5C. In addition to the particular PEO, our results could also enlighten studies on other polymer-based solid electrolytes.
