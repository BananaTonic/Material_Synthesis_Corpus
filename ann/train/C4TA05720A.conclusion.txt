Conclusion
In summary, a new class of polymer electrolyte materials, high-performance ILs-based NCPE with strong anisotropic ionic conductive has been designed and fabricated using a unidirectional freezing method, a liquid crystal self-templating approach and a vacuum degassing method. The highly ordered honeycomb-like microporous structure resulted in the improvement of the strong anisotropic ionic conductivity. Well dispersed and self-organized HNTs facilitated a considerable improvement in the mechanical properties. Crucially, the obtained ILs-based nanocomposite polymer electrolytes have high temperature robustness and thermal stability. Therefore, this approach is very promising for preparing high performance polymer electrolytes for practical applications such as lithium batteries.
