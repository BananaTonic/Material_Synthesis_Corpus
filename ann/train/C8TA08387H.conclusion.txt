Conclusions
Coating a layer of polyelectrolytes like PSSH or PSSNa can enhance the Seebeck coefficient and thus the power factor of PEDOT:PSS. Both the Seebeck coefficient and the power factor increase with increasing RH. PSSH/A-PEDOT:PSS exhibits a Seebeck coefficient of 43.5 μV K−1, an electrical conductivity of 2120 S cm−1 and thus a power factor of 401 μW m−1 K−2. PSSNa can also significantly improve the Seebeck coefficient and the power factors of A-PEDOT:PSS and BA-PEDOT:PSS. PSSNa/BA-PEDOT:PSS exhibits a Seebeck coefficient of 48.1 μV K−1, an electrical conductivity of 1732 S cm−1 and thus a power factor of 401 μW m−1 K−2. These power factors are higher than that of PEDOT:PSS:PSSH, a mixed ionic-electronic conductor, by several orders of magnitude. The output voltages of these materials under a temperature gradient are stable with time. The enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient by polyelectrolytes is attributed to the energy filtering arising from the Soret effect of the ions. This work opens a new avenue for the development of high-performance TE polymers.
