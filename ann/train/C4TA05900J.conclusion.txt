Conclusions
High-performance nanostructured LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4 powders were prepared by a solvothermal method. Simultaneously, the LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4 nanocrystalline was successfully coated with a uniform conductive PAS layer by pyrolysis of the phenolic resin, and the secondary particles consisting of primary LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4 nanocrystals with PAS matrix were formed. The LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4–PAS composite with high conductivity delivers a discharge capacity of 161, 147, 141, 115, 107, and 79 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C, 0.5 C, 1 C, 5 C, 10 C, and 20 C, respectively, and it can retain 90% of the initial reversible capacity even after 100 cycles at a rate of 20 C. The improved electrochemical performance is ascribed to the homogeneous conductive PAS coating and the well dispersed PAS network, which protects the LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4–PAS against HF attack and leads to an obvious reduction of Mn dissolution and a greatly enhanced electronic conductivity. The MnLi˙ antisite defects, Mn dissolution and electrolyte decomposition are considered as the determining factors for capacity fading during the charge–discharge process of the lithium manganese phosphate class cathode materials.
