Proton transport has been recognized as an essential process in many biological systems, as well as electrochemical devices including fuel cells and redox flow batteries. In the present study, we address the pressing need for solvent-free proton conducting polymer electrolytes for high-temperature PEM fuel cell applications by developing a novel all-solid polyelectrolyte membrane with a self-assembled proton-channel structure. We show that this self-assembled nanostructure endows the material with exciting ‘dry’ proton conductivity at elevated temperatures, as high as 0.3 mS cm−1 at 120 °C, making it an attractive candidate for high-temperature PEM fuel cell applications. Based on the combined investigation of solid-state NMR, FTIR and conductivity measurements, we propose that both molecular design and nano-scale structures are essential for obtaining highly conductive anhydrous proton conductors.
