Experimental
Materials
Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Na2CO3, polyvinyl alcohol (Mowiol® PVA-224) and glutaraldehyde (GA, 50% mass in water) were purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-chem Technology Co. Ltd. Formamide and 2,3-epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (≥95%) were supplied by Tianjin Heowns Bio-chem Technology Co. Ltd. NaOH, KOH, NaNO3 and NaCl were provided by Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development Co. Ltd.
Preparation of LDH platelets and nanosheets
A metal nitrate solution was prepared by dissolving Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (2.27 g) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (1.66 g) in 100 mL of deionized water and then titrated up to pH = 11 ± 0.1 by a mixed basic solution (1.6 M NaOH and 0.8 M Na2CO3). An emulsion was formed and then aged in an autoclave at 180 °C for 48 h to prepare MgAl–CO3-LDH platelets.29 Using MgAl–CO3-LDH as the starting material, an anion exchange process was implemented to prepare MgAl–Cl-LDH and MgAl–NO3-LDH via a salt-acid treatment according to the previous reports.30,31 A regeneration method32 was carried out to prepare MgAl–OH-LDH (Fig. S3): the MgAl–CO3-LDH powder was heated in air at 450 °C for 5 h and put in deionized water under a N2 atmosphere and continuous stirring for 16 h. MgAl–NO3-LDH was dispersed in formamide protected with N2 and mechanically shaken for 2 days to yield LDH nanosheets.
Preparation of QPVA
PVA (10.00 g) was dissolved in 90 mL water under stirring at 85 °C for 3 h. The obtained solution was cooled down to 65 °C, followed by the addition of 2 M KOH (5.55 g) solution and (2,3-epoxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (15.00 g) under continuous stirring with a reaction time of 4 h.33 After pouring the mixture into excess ethanol, the polymer product was precipitated, purified by several washing cycles in ethanol until pH = 7, and then vacuum-dried at 60 °C for 36 h.
Preparation of the membranes
The LDH membrane was prepared by vacuum filtration of the LDH nanosheet formamide suspension (1 mg mL−1) through a polysulfone membrane filter (pore diameter, ∼0.2 μm) followed by vacuum drying at 80 °C for 12 h. For a typical preparation of the composite membrane illustrated in Fig. 1, 0.50 mL of QPVA aqueous solution (10 mg mL−1) was added dropwise to 45 mL of LDH nanosheet formamide suspension (1 mg mL−1) under vigorous stirring followed by ultrasonic treatment for 5 min. Then, 0.05 mL of GA was added under continuous stirring for 5 min. The obtained homogeneous mixture was assembled into LDH/QPVA-10 (10 refers to the mass percentage of QPVA in the LDH/QPVA composite) membrane via vacuum filtration and then vacuum-dried at 80 °C for 12 h. Following the same procedure, LDH/QPVA-20, LDH/QPVA-30 and LDH/QPVA-40 membranes (diameter, 42 mm; thickness, ∼25 μm) were prepared, and the total mass of LDH nanosheets and QPVA was fixed at about 50 mg.

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the LDH and LDH/QPVA samples were obtained using a D/MAX-2500 X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. The morphology of the LDH nanosheets was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the LDH and LDH/QPVA samples were obtained using a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer. The morphologies of LDH platelets, the pure LDH membrane, and composite membranes were characterized using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, Nanosem 430). Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 was utilized to determine the particle size distribution of exfoliated LDH nanosheets and measure the zeta potential of LDH colloids. Elemental analysis of LDH and QPVA was performed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Varian Vista MPX), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and elemental analyzer (Elementar Vario Micro cube). Thermal properties of LDH and LDH/QPVA samples were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, NETZSCH-TG 209 F3) under a N2 atmosphere at the heating rate of 10 °C cm−1.
Measurements
Ion conductivity of the sample was determined via two-probe alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy using an electrochemical workstation (CompactStat, IVIUM Tech.). The sample was probed by two parallel platinum electrodes, and the in-plane conductivity under 98% relative humidity (RH) was tested using a thermo-hygrostat. Ion conductivity (σ, S cm−1) was calculated according to the equation: σ = l/AR, where l (cm) is the distance between electrodes, R (Ω) is the resistance, and A (cm2) represents the cross-sectional area of the sample. The relationship between the ion conductivity and temperature can be defined by the following formula: ln σ = −Ea/(RT) + ln σ0, where Ea (kJ mol−1) represents the activation energy for ion conduction. Before the conductivity measurement, LDH platelets were cold-pressed into pellets with a diameter of 12.5 mm and a thickness of about 0.15 mm under a pressure of 10 MPa. The LDH pellets were cut into strip samples and clamped between the electrodes. The membrane samples were placed in centrifuge tubes filled up with aqueous solutions of sodium salts, tightly capped, and kept at 60 °C for 12 h. The salts and concentration of their solutions were NaNO3 (3.5 M), NaCl (5 M), and Na2CO3 (pH = 11). Accordingly, the obtained membranes were designated as LDH(NO3−)/QPVA, LDH(Cl−)/QPVA and LDH(CO32−)/QPVA. Before testing, the membrane samples were dried at 60 °C under vacuum for 12 h after washing with excess water. To avoid the influence of ambient CO2, the conductive performance of LDH-based membranes with OH− intercalation (LDH(OH−)/QPVA) was measured using a new approach reported by Ziv et al.34 (Fig. S13 and S14).
The membrane samples were vacuum-dried at 60 °C for 12 h, and the weight (Wdry, g), surface area (Adry, cm2) and thickness (Tdry, μm) were determined. Then, the samples were equilibrated in a thermo-hygrostat under 98% RH at different temperatures. The weight (Wwet, g), surface area (Awet, cm2) and thickness (Twet, μm) of the hydrated samples were measured. The water uptake and in-plane and through-plane swelling were calculated respectively according to the following formulae: water uptake (%) = (Wwet − Wdry)/Wdry × 100, area swelling (%) = (Awet − Adry)/Adry × 100, and ΔT (%) = (Twet − Tdry)/Tdry × 100.
The mechanical properties of the membranes were measured by an electronic tensile machine (Yangzhou Zhongke WDW-02) at a stretching rate of 1 mm min−1 at room temperature (∼20 °C) and a relative humidity of ∼30% RH.
