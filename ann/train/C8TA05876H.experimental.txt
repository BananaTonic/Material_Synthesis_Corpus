Results and discussion
Feasibility of the proposed strategies predicted by GCMD
In view of the extraordinarily promising alkaline resistance of SC AEMs with pendant alkyl chains consisting of six –CH2– groups, it is intended to further improve the OH− conductivity of this type of AEM to attain excellent comprehensive performance. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations were firstly employed to predict whether the structures proposed in the introduction were valid in facilitating organic QA cation clustering on the molecular level. As shown in Fig. 1(A), the QA cations on the typical SC structure tend to aggregate for the formation of ionic clusters, which is in agreement with previous observations.18 Nevertheless, a large number of QA clusters are unexpectedly isolated by incorporated hydrophobic side chains, and thus the available channels for smooth OH− transport in SC AEMs are rather limited, leading to unsatisfactory conductivity. Comparatively, the D-SC and L-SC structures give rise to a much more desirable micro-morphology, where the QA cations assemble to build bigger clusters compared with those in the SC structure, which is in favor of them connecting well with each other (Fig. 1(B) and (C)).
The superiority of D-SC and L-SC in establishing well-penetrating OH− transfer channels was further ascertained by the calculated structure factors. The structure factor patterns were plotted by collecting coordinate information for the QA and OH species, and thus the appearing peak refers to the uniform aggregation of the alkaline QA head-groups (Fig. 2). For the SC configuration, a broad peak emerges at 3.2 nm−1 corresponding to a Bragg spacing of 2.0 nm. The peaks corresponding to QA aggregation in the D-SC and L-SC configurations shift to smaller q-values of 2.5 nm−1 and 2.3 nm−1, corresponding to larger Bragg spacings of 2.5 nm and 2.7 nm, respectively. This implies that the D-SC and L-SC architectures hold great promise for constructing the desired large cationic clusters, which agrees well with the above morphology observations. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of peak intensity, the peaks for D-SC and L-SC are significantly stronger than that for SC, suggesting that the homogeneous and separated microphase morphology is much more easily formed in the former two structures. Both the morphology and structural information results give a clear implication that the phase separating ability of the suggested D-SC and L-SC structures is prominently stronger than the conventional SC structure. Inspired by this finding, the subsequent experimental efforts are devoted to synthesizing the D-SC and L-SC AEMs as well as inspecting their performance in the field of fuel cells.

Synthesis of D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE
The two targeted structures were experimentally achieved by employing highly chemically stabilized poly(arylene ether phosphine oxide)s bearing amino moieties (paAE) as the main chains, and aliphatic cationic precursors as the side chains, as depicted in Fig. 3. The two types of precursor bearing one or two QA moieties were successfully synthesized referring to previously reported methods.28 The synthesis schemes and structural details of the involved monomers confirmed by 1H NMR spectra are summarized in the ESI (Scheme S1 and S2, Fig. S3–S5). The main chain paAE with different degrees of –NH2 functionalization (50% and 100%) used here allows the production of a wide range of AEMs with varied IECs.

The D-SC cationic polymer candidate was produced from paAE and single-cation monomers (BrQA). Huge excess amounts of the BrQA precursors were employed to enable the complete conversion of –NH2. The aromatic proton resonance from 6.7 to 7.8 ppm arising from the paAE backbone is clearly visible in the 1H NMR spectrum of D-SC-paAE (Fig. 4(A)). The additional sharp peak at 3.0 ppm is assignable to the methyl protons of the QA cations along with three adjacent peaks at 1.2–1.8 ppm belonging to the methylene protons of the alkyl chains, indicating the successful incorporation of the QA side chains. By comparing the integral ratios of the methyl proton peaks derived from the side chains to the aromatic proton peaks ascribed to the mains chains, quantitative grafting degrees can be calculated. As shown in Table 1, the grafting degree of D-SC-paAE50% and D-SC-paAE100% is up to 187% and 176% respectively, implying that one –NH2 group could react with approximately two QA terminated alkyl chains as anticipated.

To avoid excessive grafting, a slight 1.1 times excess of BrBQA in relation to the molar number of –NH2 was added to obtain the pre-designed structure. As shown in the 1H NMR spectrum of L-SC-paAE (Fig. 4(b)), the peaks are well assignable to the protons located on the backbone and the side chains. Of particular note, the –NH– proton peak at 3.7 ppm is expressly observed, and the –NH– number in the resulting L-SC-paAE calculated by 1H NMR is approximately equal to that of –NH2– in the original paAE, indicating that the L-SC structure was successfully obtained. According to the 1H NMR spectra, the double-cation grafting ratio of L-SC-paAE50% and L-SC-paAE100% is computed to be 95% and 92%, respectively (Table 1). On the basis of the four polymers’ compositions, the theoretical IECs are easily obtained, which coincide well with the experimental IECs determined by titration (Table 1).
Experimental morphology observations
The phase aggregated morphology of the four synthesized AEMs was experimentally proven by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode at ambient temperature. In both the AFM and TEM images, the darker domains represent the hydrophilic QA cations, while the brighter domains represent the hydrophobic backbone and the alkyl side chains. As identified in Fig. 5 and 6, all of the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs display distinct micro-phase separated morphology, consistent with the simulated pictures. For each series of AEM, an increasing grafting ratio of QA functionalized side chains results in enlarged ionic domains, clearly visible in Fig. 6. Moreover, there are still comparative disparities between the connectivity and shape of the QA rich channels of the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs. As revealed by the AFM and TEM pictures, D-SC-paAE shows sufficiently developed long stripe-shaped OH− channels, while L-SC-paAE shows evenly distributed small sized ionic clusters. Such morphology differences will lead to distinct H2O absorption and OH− transfer behavior for the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs, which will be discussed below.

Water uptake
The water facilitating OH− conduction mechanism is widely acknowledged in the AEM area, and thus it is highly demanded that the as-prepared AEMs assimilate sufficient water molecules to assist QA dissociation. However, excess water absorption may cause mechanical failure and AEMs with immoderately high water uptake (WU) are vulnerable to alkaline attack. Consequently, the balance between conductivity and stability should be taken into consideration in the design of AEMs. In our proposed structures, the linkage is extended to six –CH2– groups rather than the typical one –CH2–, which is beneficial in limiting redundant water permeation for AEMs with high cation concentration. This fact is verified by the quite low WU of all of the four resulting AEMs. In Table 1, it can be seen that the WU of D-SC-paAE100% and L-SC-paAE100% is only 24.1% and 30.1% at 30 °C, respectively, albeit their IECs far exceed 2.0 mmol g−1. Furthermore, the D-SC-paAE AEMs demonstrate relatively lower WU than the L-SC-paAE AEMs, originating from the micro-morphology differences. As clarified above, D-SC-paAE possesses long-range developed anion transport galleries, thereby leading to much more water penetration.
The temperature dependent WU and linear swelling ratios (LERs) of the four AEMs are plotted in Fig. 7. As expected, the WU of all of the four AEMs steadily increases with increasing temperature. For D-SC-paAE100% and L-SC-paAE100% with the highest IEC for each type of AEMs, the WU only shows minor increases to an acceptable 45.2% and 40.5%, even when the temperature increases to 80 °C (Fig. 7(A)). The LER is further employed to directly evaluate the deformation of the AEMs. As depicted in Fig. 7(B), it is only when the temperature is up to 50 °C that all the pre-measured AEMs show detectable swelling. The swelling ratios of the four AEMs are all less than 10% over the entire temperature range, suggesting that such designed structures will not cause severe swelling, although they have higher local cation densities in comparison to the commonly reported side chain structure.

Hydroxide conductivity
High hydroxide conductivity is the most important aspect for AEMs applied in alkaline fuel cells. To elucidate the advantages of our designed structures in enhancing OH− transport, D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs with varied IECs were tested. For each series of AEM, increasing IEC directly relates to increasing hydroxide conductivity, since improved water absorption levels enhance the local mobility of water and percolation of QA containing domains. For D-SC-paAE100% with an IEC of 2.41 mmol g−1, the OH− conductivity reaches up to 0.058 S cm−1 at 30 °C, which is considerably higher than those of previously reported SC AEMs. For example, Bae et al. explored fluorene-based polymers with six –CH2– groups incorporated between the backbones and the QA groups, and the resulting AEM demonstrated a hydroxide conductivity of 0.024 S cm−1 at 30 °C (IEC = 2.93 mmol g−1).25 Lin et al. reported a typical QA based SC AEM with six carbon spacers using PES as a scaffold, which presented a moderate OH− conductivity of 0.028 S cm−1 (IEC = 1.48 mmol g−1).21 Such an identical architecture was achieved on a PPO backbone with seven carbon spacers, reported by Jannasch et al.29 A hydroxide conductivity of 0.033 S cm−1 at 20 °C was obtained for the AEM with an IEC of 1.80 mmol g−1.
In terms of the conductivity improvement issue, the ability of L-SC-paAE is not so super as that of D-SC-paAE. Although L-SC-paAE100% possesses a similar QA density to D-SC-paAE100%, the former gives only a moderate hydroxide conductivity of 0.029 S cm−1 at 30 °C. The are two main reasons responsible for this phenomenon. On one hand, the long stripe-shaped channels existing in D-SC-paAE contribute to elevating the conductivity. On the other hand, the D-SC-paAE series of AEMs have slightly higher λ values (Table 1), which is advantageous to QA dissociation.
The temperature dependent conductivity of the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs is plotted in Fig. 8. As the temperature increases, all of the as-tested AEMs in the form of OH−, Cl− or HCO3− show increasing hydroxide conductivity. Particularly, the OH− conductivity of D-SC-paAE100% even exceeds 0.1 S cm−1 at 80 °C, which is nearly 1.5 times that of L-SC-paAE100% with similar QA densities (Fig. 8(A)), further revealing that D-SC shows prominent superiority in obtaining high hydroxide conductivity. The apparent activation energies estimated from the slopes of the ln(σ) vs. 1000/T curves for the four AEMs are between 13.0 and 18.7 kJ mol−1, comparable to reported values (10–23 kJ mol−1) for other AEMs (Fig. S6).30 Among them, D-SC-paAE100% has the lowest activation energy, indicating that the barrier to overcome for OH− transport in D-SC-paAE100% is rather low. This phenomenon stems from the quite large ionic clusters that are evenly distributed in the hydrophobic backbone phase observed for D-SC-paAE100%. As presented in Fig. 8(B), the HCO3− conductivity for both D-SC-paAE100% and L-SC-paAE100% is above 0.01 S cm−1 in the common operational temperature range of 50 °C to 80 °C. Therefore, it follows that these AEMs show sufficiently high CO2 tolerance, suitable for applications under various harsh environments, even at extremely high CO2 concentration. Briefly speaking, both of the D-SC and L-SC structured AEMs are able to potentially be employed in alkaline fuel cells, and the D-SC structure is especially fascinating in boosting the OH− conductivity of SC AEMs.

Thermal and mechanical stability
AEMs incorporated into alkaline fuel cells are required to sustain a certain pressure from the fuel cell apparatus and gas fuels at relatively high temperature, and thus concern over the AEMs’ mechanical and thermal stability is imperative. The thermal degradation of the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE samples was recorded by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves, as shown in Fig. 9. Following the general degradation trend for most SC AEMs, all of the AEMs exhibit four stages of decomposition, including the loss of residual water, the decomposition of the QA moieties, and the disintegration of the alkyl side chains as well as the main chains. Below 100 °C, the degradation only deals with water molecule evaporation, while the breaking of chemical bonds does not happen. Since the operation temperature of polymer fuel cells is generally less than 100 °C, such thermal stability of the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs is sufficient for fuel cell applications.

As depicted in Table 2, the tensile strength, the Young’s modulus and the elongation at break of the four dry as-prepared AEMs lie in the range 23.9–50.0 MPa, 553–1156 MPa, and 7.9–29.8%, respectively, demonstrating that these AEMs are flexible and robust enough for usage. Ascribed to the plasticization function of water molecules, wet AEMs show lower tensile strength and higher elongation at break. Nevertheless, the lowest tensile strength of 8.9 MPa for D-SC-paAE100% still proves the good stiffness of the resultant AEMs. The promising comprehensive mechanical performance of the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs in both wet and dry states suggests that they can adapt well to humidity fluctuations during operation.

AEMs with QA functional groups are known to easily degrade under alkaline environments via nucleophilic substitution or the Hofmann elimination route. The long-term stability of D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE was investigated by immersing the as-prepared AEMs into 2 mol L−1 alkaline solutions to perform accelerated aging. It is important to point out that after 30 days of alkaline ageing, the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE samples still retained acceptable solubility in DMSO. Thus, the 1H NMR spectra of the alkaline processed D-SC-paAE100% (Fig. 10(A)) and L-SC-paAE100% (Fig. 10(B)) polymers were recorded to detect their chemical structure variations to acquire an unambiguous disintegration mechanism and to give quantitative information about the loss of QA.

According to pre-existing knowledge, β hydrogens attached onto QA groups have a tendency to exhibit Hofmann degradation. However, proton resonance originating from –CHCH2– belonging to emblematic Hofmann degradation products is not visible in both Fig. 10(A) and (B). It is believed that the Hofmann elimination pathway in D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE is effectively restricted by the six –CH2– spacers, which is in accordance with previous reports.21 Nucleophilic substitution is thus confirmed to be the dominant degradation route for the QA groups in the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs. For D-SC-paAE100%, the integral area ratio of the peak at 3.1 ppm derived from Hb located on QA in relation to the peaks around 7.4–7.8 ppm assignable to Ha lying on the backbone decreases with the increasing number of alkaline treatment days. By calculating such an integral ratio, the retention of QA can be easily estimated. After 30 days of alkaline treatment, the QA number in D-SC-paAE100% still maintains 82% of its original value, which is comparable to reported SC AEMs,29 implying that D-SC-paAE inherits the excellent alkaline stability of SC AEMs with six carbon spacers.
For L-SC-paAE100%, it can be found that the integral area ratio (Ia : Ib) of the peaks at 0.9–1.8 ppm corresponding to the methyl and methylene protons (Ha) from the side chains to the peaks at 7.4–7.8 ppm corresponding to the partial aromatic protons (Hb) from the main chains increases with increasing alkaline aging time. The increasing peak area is mainly contributed by the generated degradation products via the nucleophilic replacement mechanism.31 Due to the serious overlapping of the proton peaks around 1.0–2.0 ppm in L-SC-paAE100%, an accurate loss number of QA cannot be calculated. Nevertheless, the ratio value of Ia : Ib merely increases by 16% for L-SC-paAE100% after 30 days of aging, which roughly indicates that L-SC-paAE possesses equally promising alkaline stability as D-SC-paAE.
The changes in IEC, conductivity, and tensile strength directly related to the fuel cell performance after alkaline treatment were also recorded to reveal the alkaline stability of the as-prepared AEMs. For the D-SC-paAE100% and L-SC-paAE100% membranes, only rather minor property losses were detected (Table 3). After 30 days of alkaline treatment at 60 °C, D-SC-paAE100% retained 88.9%, 91.4%, and 81.6% of its initial IEC, hydroxide conductivity and tensile strength, respectively, suggesting it can well tolerate the alkaline environment of fuel cells for long periods. Even if the alkaline treatment temperature is increased to 80 °C, the descending conductivity trend of D-SC-paAE100% and L-SC-paAE100% was found to be terminated on the 8th day. After 15 days of alkaline immersion, 75.9% and 69.0% of the original hydroxide conductivity values for D-SC-paAE100% and L-SC-paAE100% remain (Fig. S7). Therefore, it is believed that both of the D-SC and L-SC designs achieve the target of enhancing the conductivity of SC AEMs, and simultaneously preserve the natural merits of SC AEMs in terms of alkaline resistance.

The high hydroxide conductivity, robust mechanical properties, and sufficient alkaline stability of the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE AEMs motivate us to continue to examine their in situ performance when used in AEMFCs. We chose to carry out the evaluation in a catalyst layer because ionic polymers are in intimate contact with the catalysts and involve the most complicated electrochemical operating environments. We supposed that the D-SC-paAE and L-SC-paAE ionomers that have good performance in the catalyst layer will serve as promising OH− conductive membranes. Polarization curves of the H2–O2 AEMFCs with D-SC-paAE100% and L-SC-paAE100% as the ionomers in both the anode and cathode catalyst layers were recorded. The discharge performance of an AEMFC is closely connected with the OH− conductive capacity of the incorporated ionomer materials. Compared with L-SC-paAE100%, the higher conductivity of D-SC-paAE100% leads to a slower voltage drop, which ensures greater output power density. At cell operating temperatures of 60 °C and 80 °C (Fig. 11), the peak power density for the AEMFCs using D-SC-paAE100% polymers as ionomers is 427 mW cm−2 and 683 mW cm−2 under a current density of 777 mA cm−2 and 1305 mA cm−2, respectively. Comparatively, the AEMFCs employing L-SC-paAE100% as ionomers give smaller peak power densities of 261 mW cm−2 and 275 mW cm−2 at 60 °C and 80 °C, respectively. Furthermore, the duration of the D-SC-paAE100% incorporated AEMFC was checked by recording the power density curves at intervals of 20 min after the AEMFC system was adequately activated at 80 °C. During 60 min of testing, the AEMFC maintained a high peak power density, mildly fluctuating between 644 mW cm−2 and 683 mW cm−2 (Fig. S8).
