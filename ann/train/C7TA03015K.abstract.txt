Organic/inorganic hybrid materials can be promising thermoelectric materials due to the possibilities of achieving high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity, which are necessary for their potential application in heat–electricity conversion. In this work, we show that the new n-type organic/inorganic hybrid C6H4NH2CuBr2I can simultaneously exhibit a high electrical conductivity of ∼3.6 × 103 S cm−1 and a Seebeck coefficient of ∼−70 μV K−1 at room temperature in a thin-film design, presenting the highest power factor reaching 1740 μW mK−2. The temperature dependence of both the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient in this C6H4NH2CuBr2I film illustrates that this organic/inorganic hybrid film behaves like a metallic material. The high electrical conductivity of the C6H4NH2CuBr2I film can be attributed to the defect-related heavy doping caused by CuI in this semiconductor, while the relatively large Seebeck coefficient is due to the coexisting entropy difference and polarization difference. The temperature-dependent polarization difference between the hot and the cold side of the film can function as an additional driving force besides the entropy difference and contribute to the Seebeck effect development in C6H4NH2CuBr2I. When applying a temperature difference of 4.8 °C along the in-plane direction, the C6H4NH2CuBr2I film with gold contacts generates a thermoelectric voltage of −0.31 mV and a thermoelectric current of −0.022 mA, suggesting a promising n-type thermoelectric material for heat–electricity conversion in thermoelectric power generators.
