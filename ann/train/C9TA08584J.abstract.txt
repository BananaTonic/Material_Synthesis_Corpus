Theoretical formulation of Na3AO4X (A = S/Se, X = F/Cl) as high-performance solid electrolytes for all-solid-state sodium batteriesElectronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c9ta08584j
It is very important and yet extremely challenging to develop solid state electrolytes to make sodium ion batteries (SIBs) safer, since the much larger size of Na+ than that of Li+ makes transport of Na+ rather difficult. Here in this work, we have carried out high throughput first principles calculations to tune the materials chemistry of Na3AO4X (A = chalcogen, X = halogen) to convert them into superb ionic conductors. In addition to confirming the excellent stability of Na3SO4F0.5Cl0.5, a known mineral existing in nature, we have identified a Na3SeO4F0.5Cl0.5 compound with the same structure as a desirable Na+ conductor. Such a newly formulated compound has extremely low activation energy for Na+ transport (0.137 eV) and a remarkably high Na+ conductivity of 8.167 mS cmâˆ’1 at room temperature (300 K). Furthermore, this superb solid electrolyte is insensitive to air/moisture, together with a very wide electrochemical window of up to 4.215 V against Na+/Na.
