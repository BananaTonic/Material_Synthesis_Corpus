Conclusions
In summary, a facile aerosol-pyrolysis strategy has been developed to self-assemble three-layered porous Fe3O4/carbon hollow spheres, and has the following unique features: (i) continuous tuning of the sphere structure from solid to porous and then to a hollow structure with adjustable shell thickness; (ii) formation of a three-layered shell consisting of a nitrogen-doped carbon outer layer, large-sized dense Fe3O4/carbon mid-layer and small-sized Fe3O4/carbon inner layer; and (iii) being very facile, controllable and cost-efficient. This interfacial control strategy results in high electrical conductivity, a restriction “hoop”, abundant meso-/micropores and buffer space of the three-layered Fe3O4/carbon hollow spheres simultaneously, which enable excellent rate capability and long-term cycling for over 1000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1.
