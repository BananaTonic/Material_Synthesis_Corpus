3.Conclusions
In summary, a flexible, thin and highly conductive alkaline anion-exchange membrane (PGG-GP) has been fabricated via a novel and efficient binary cross-linking strategy employing glutaraldehyde and pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde as binary cross-linking agents, for application in both the all-solid-state SCs and the flexible rechargeable zinc–air batteries. The developed PGG-GP membrane possessed exceptional advantages such as high hydroxide ion conductivity and good thermal stability, while retaining low anisotropic swelling degree and robust mechanical strength. The all-solid-state SCs employing the PGG-GP membrane displayed a high rate capability and excellent cycling stability with 87.5% specific capacitance retention after 8000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1, which is superior to that of the A201 membrane (75.3%). The rechargeable all-solid-state zinc–air batteries containing the PGG-GP electrolyte exhibited high discharge capacity (long discharge time) and excellent performance stability, outperforming the A201 membrane. Meanwhile, the flexible PGG-GP-based cell also demonstrated an outstanding output power density under bending conditions. As a result, the novel concept of utilizing a binary cross-linking strategy to prepare highly conductive alkaline anion polymer electrolyte membranes will open up an opportunity for the development of all-solid-state SCs and flexible rechargeable zinc–air batteries.
