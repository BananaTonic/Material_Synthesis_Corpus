Experimental
LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4 nanomaterials were prepared by an ascorbic acid-assisted solvothermal method. All the precursors were purchased without further pre-treatment or purification. Stoichiometric amounts of LiOH·H2O, H3PO4, MnSO4·H2O and FeSO4·7H2O with a molar ratio of 3 : 1 : 0.9 : 0.1 were dissolved in 1 : 1 (V/V) ethanol–water solvent under stirring, and then ascorbic acid was added (molar ratio of LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4: ascorbic acid = 1 : 2.6) into the solution. After 5 h of vigorous stirring, the solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and the autoclave was put into a preset electric furnace and maintained at 200 °C for 12 h. The obtained solution was filtered and washed with ethanol and distilled water several times, and finally dried at 80 °C in vacuum for 5 h. The LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4–PAS composite was prepared as follows: firstly, LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4 and the desired amount of phenolic resin were mixed. The mixture was ball-milled at 350 rpm for 5 h, followed by heat treatment in a tubular furnace at 350 °C for 3 h, and then heated again at 600 °C for 5 h under a Ar/H2 (Ar : H2 = 95 : 5) atmosphere to obtain the final LiMn0.9Fe0.1PO4–PAS composite. For comparison, LiMnPO4–PAS composite was prepared by the same method.
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the products were determined by X-ray powder diffractometer (Empyrean) equipped with Cu Kα radiation over the 2θ range of 10°–130°. Rietveld refinement for XRD patterns was performed using the GSAS/EXPGUI package. The manganese dissolution was evaluated by the elemental analysis using OPTIMA 5300DV ICP optical emission spectrometer. Morphological profiles and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were observed by field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Helios Nanolab600i). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected-area electron microscopy (SAED) were performed using a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS10 (USA) over the range of 400–4000 cm−1 with spectral resolution of 4 cm−1. The conductivity of the composites was measured by SB120/2 four-point probe method. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-alpha X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) were examined to identify the surface chemistry of the LiMnPO4–PAS electrode after cycling. The amount of polyacene in the composite was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) from room temperature to 650 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, using a simultaneous thermal analysis (DSC, Netzsch STA449F3) in Ar/O2 (Ar: 60 mL min−1, O2: 20 mL min−1) atmosphere. The BET specific surface area was calculated from nitrogen adsorption isotherms using 3H-2000PS1 surface area and pore analyzer at 77 K.
The electrochemical measurements were carried out by the assembly of 2016 coin-type cell with lithium metal foil as the counter and reference electrode. The slurry was obtained by mixing 80 wt% active material, acetylene black (10 wt%), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, 10 wt%) in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solvent, and then coated on aluminum foil (φ = 14 mm) to form the working electrode. The mass loading in the electrode was around 2 mg 1 mol L−1 LiPF6 in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) with 1 : 1 volume ratio was used as the electrolyte. All cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box in which both moisture and oxygen levels were less than 1 ppm. The cells were examined using a battery testing system (Neware, BST-5V3 mA) at different charge–discharge rates between 2.5 V and 4.6 V. The cells were charged at a CC–CV protocol, i.e., first charged at a constant current of 0.1 C to 4.6 V followed by holding at 4.6 V for 30 min. Electrochemical impedance spectra (frequency range: 0.01–105 Hz) of electrodes in coin-type cells were performed with an electrochemical workstation (PARSTAT 2273).
