Conclusions
The oxide-ion conductivity has been increased and the activation energy of oxide-ion conduction has been lowered by the substitution of Nd with Sr cations in NdBaInO4. Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 showed the highest electrical conductivity among Nd1−xSrxBaInO4−x/2 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3). The oxide-ion conductivity σion of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 was 7.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 858 °C, which is higher than that of NdBaInO4 (σion = 3.6 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 858 °C). The crystal structure of Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 has been analysed, and we have confirmed that Sr exists at the Nd site. Nd0.9Sr0.1BaInO3.95 contains oxygen vacancies, which were not observed for NdBaInO4 at room temperature. Thus, the increase of the oxide-ion conductivity is mainly attributed to the increase of the carrier concentration. BVE calculations indicated two-dimensional oxide-ion diffusion in the A2O3 ((Nd,Sr)2O3) unit on the bc-plane and a decrease of the energy barrier by the substitution of Nd with Sr cations.
