2.Experimental
2.1Materials
2-Amino-4-hydroxy-6-methylpyrimidine (purity: 98%), 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (purity: 98%), dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL, purity: 95%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, purity: 99%) and (3-aminopropyl) trimethoxysilane (APTMS, purity: 97%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA, average Mn = 500 g mol−1) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and filtered through a basic alumina column before utilization. 2,2-Azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) was recrystallized twice before use. (2-(3-(6-Methyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydropyrimidin-2-yl)ureido)ethyl methacrylate) (UPyMA) was synthesized according to the literature.42 Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, Aladdin) was dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 24 h. All other solvents were freshly distilled under reduced pressure prior to use.
2.2Synthesis of UPy-NCO
UPy-NCO (2(6-isocyanatohexylaminocarbonylamino)-6-methyl-4[1H]pyrimidinone) was synthesized through the following method:43 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-methylpyrimidine (1.6 g, 12.8 mmol) was added to 18 mL of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and heated to 100 °C for 20 h under nitrogen protection. After the reaction, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then the mixture was transferred to 60 mL hexane and a white solid precipitated. The white precipitate was collected using a Büchner funnel and washed with excess hexane three times. The product was dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C for 8 h.
2.3Synthesis of UPy-modified silica nanoparticles (SiO2–UPy)
The SiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using a modified Stöber method. Absolute ethanol (50 mL), 28% aqueous ammonia (5 mL) and deionized water (1 mL) were mixed in a round-bottom flask equipped with stirring. The solution of TEOS (6.0 g) and absolute ethanol (50 mL) was added dropwise into the round-bottom flask. The mixture was stirred vigorously at 25 °C for 16 h. The white particles were collected by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 12 min). The obtained particles were washed and centrifuged in ethanol three more times. The nanoparticles were then dried in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 12 h to remove the residual solvents.
The dried nanoparticles (1.0 g) were dispersed in ethanol (50 mL) by ultrasonication. While stirring, APTMS (1 mL) in ethanol (20 mL) was added dropwise at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 12 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. The particles were centrifuged and washed with ethanol three times, and amine-functionalized nanoparticles (SiO2–NH2) were obtained. Then SiO2–NH2 (0.60 g) and UPy-NCO (0.30 g) were dissolved in DMF (100 mL). The catalyst of DBTDL (3 drops) was added and the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 24 h under the nitrogen atmosphere. The UPy-functionalized nanoparticles (SiO2–UPy) were washed with DMF two times and finally with THF. The final nanoparticles were then dried under vacuum for 24 h at 60 °C.
2.4Preparation of composite polymer electrolytes
The copolymer of PEG–UPy was synthesized according to previous studies.41 The copolymer of PEG–UPy, LiTFSI (with an EO/Li+ molar ratio of 16 : 1) and SiO2–UPy (3 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% copolymer) were dissolved in THF. The mixture was then vigorously stirred for 4 h at ambient temperature to form a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, SHCPEs were formed by casting the homogeneous solution in a Teflon mold. The SHCPEs were laid aside at room temperature to remove most of the solvent. The obtained membrane was then transferred to a vacuum oven at 70 °C for 24 h to generate a flexible and sticky SHCPE.
2.5Characterization of the polymer electrolytes
1H NMR spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker AV400 spectrometer. The FT-IR spectroscopy was performed on an FT interferometer (Equinox 55, Bruker, Germany). The data were recorded over the range of 4000–400 cm−1. The surface modification of nanoparticles and the thermal stability of SHCPE-10 were evaluated using a thermogravimetry instrument (TGA, 4000 PerkinElmer, USA). The TGA analysis was performed at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere from 30 to 800 °C. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Hitachi SU8010) was employed to detect the dispersity and morphologies of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix of PEG–UPy. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations combined with Energy Dispersive X-ray Detector (EDX) mapping were performed on a FEI Talos F200X.
2.6Electrochemical measurements
The ionic conductivity of the SHCPEs and CPE was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using an AC impedance analyzer (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Netherlands). Coin cells with stainless-steel electrodes were assembled to conduct the measurements with the frequency ranging from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The measurements were carried out at temperatures from 20 to 90 °C. The ionic conductivity was obtained from the equation, σ = L/(S/Rb), where L is the thickness of the CPEs, S is the effective contact area between the electrolyte and electrode, and Rb is the bulk resistance of CPEs. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted to measure the electrochemical stability of SHCPE-10 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The Li+ transference number (tLi+) was measured using the Li|SHCPE-10|Li cell. The cell was subjected to a polarization bias of 10 mV (ΔV) to determine the currents from the initial (I0) to the steady state (Is). The impedance of R0 and Rs was respectively measured before and after the polarization. The tLi+ was calculated using the equation: Is(ΔV − I0R0)/I0(ΔV − IsRs).
2.7Self-healing and mechanical test
The long strip specimen of SHCPE-10/CPE-10 was formed in a Teflon mold. To demonstrate the self-healing capability, the polymer specimen was cut with a knife. Then the gap of the polymer was observed using a microscope. The mechanical properties of SHCPE-10 and CPE-10 were evaluated using the electronic universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 5 mm min−1.
2.8Interfacial stability of electrolyte/electrodes
The galvanostatic test was used to evaluate the interfacial stability of SHCPE-10/lithium metal. Time evolution of voltage profiles was determined using the Li|SHCPE-10|Li cell at various current densities.
2.9Battery fabrication and evaluation
The charge and discharge tests of LIBs were performed with a battery testing system (LANHE CT2001A). The cathode was prepared by mixing LiFePO4 (80%) with carbon black (10%) and PVDF (10%). The resultant slurry was coated on an aluminum current collector. The obtained cathode sheet, SHCPE-10 and lithium metal were assembled together to form Li|SHCPE-10|LiFePO4 batteries. Charge/discharge performance of the LIBs was determined from 2.5 V to 4.2 V at 60 °C.
