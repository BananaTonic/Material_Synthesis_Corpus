III.Results and discussion
1.Phase stability
Starting with the structure of the unit cell of LGPS as an initial guess, structural optimization resulted in a slightly distorted tetragonal crystal structure of NGPS (see Fig. 1) with unit cell parameters a = 9.327 Å, b = 9.841 Å, and c = 13.903 Å, and angles α = 90.681, β = 91.270, and γ = 90.068. We now present the analysis of the stability of this phase using the unit cell of NGPS consisting two formula units (fifty atoms) in a periodic box with dimensions equal to unit cell parameters.

(a)Phonons
Phonons are essentially the quantized vibrational normal modes of a material, and their frequencies (ω) reflect the stiffness of bonds in the material. Phonon frequencies are obtained as the square root of the eigenvalues of the Hessian (matrix of second derivatives of energy w.r.t atomic displacements weighed by inverse masses). An imaginary frequency (negative second derivative of energy) precisely indicates a structural instability. If ω2 &gt; 0 for all frequencies, the structure is at an energy minimum and hence locally stable. Thus, the phonon spectrum is effective in assessing the stability of the material. Fig. 2 compares the distribution of Γ-point phonon states as a function of frequency for both NGPS and LGPS wherein negative frequencies are used to indicate the imaginary values. The plots are obtained by introducing a Gaussian function of suitable width centered on each frequency to yield a smooth curve. Since all the ω's of the predicted NGPS material span positive frequencies, we establish that the material is structurally at least metastable or locally stable. Furthermore, the higher density of states at lower frequencies in NGPS than those in LGPS suggests that it is relatively more stable than its Li counterpart, particularly at elevated temperatures.

Following observations can be made from the inspection of the eigenvectors of phonons. Higher energy modes (500–570 cm−1) in both the materials are mainly from the vibrations involving P and S atoms of PS4 tetrahedra. In LGPS, modes less than 450 cm−1 arise mainly from the Li–S bonds followed by Ge–S bonds. In NGPS, three distinct bands are seen. Major contributions from Na–S bonds are mainly observed in the first band (upto 300 cm−1), and the middle band (330–405 cm−1) has contribution primarily from Ge–S bonds of the GeS4 tetrahedra. An important finding is that NGPS has relatively more number of states at lower frequencies than in LGPS that involve Na–S bonds, and are expected to enhance Na+ ion diffusivity.
(b)Reactions of decomposition of NGPS: energetics
To establish the chemical stability of NGPS, we considered the chemical reactions shown in Table 1 (above), representing different ways in which the proposed structure may decompose, and estimated corresponding energies expressed per formula unit of the reactant. The negative energies in the final three reactions in the table mean that they are exothermic and may occur spontaneously, indicating the reactant's instability. Mo et al.11 similarly proposed the following reaction which favours the decomposition of LGPS:8Li10GeP2S12 → 2Li3PS4 + Li4GeS4 (−0.625 eV/f.u.)

The compound Na4GeS4 has not been reported in the literature or the ICSD, and was obtained by DFT optimization of the structure analogous to that of Li4GeS4, obtained by replacing Li with Na. The Li4GeS4 structure was obtained from The Materials Project.25
The stability of LGPS against reaction (8) was attributed to entropic effects at higher temperatures (including room temperature).11 The total entropy change ΔS for the compound was evaluated approximately by Du et al.,26 and is given by the sum ΔSconfig_Li + ΔSmix_P/Ge + ΔSvib. The first term represents configurational entropy due to partial occupancies of Li sites, and the second term is the mixing entropy due to P and Ge disorder in the originally reported structure.10 These two terms can be assumed to be the same for NGPS also due to similarity in the structures of both compounds. We evaluated vibrational entropy ΔSvib as a function of temperature for both compounds using eqn (1) with the Γ-point phonon states, and find that NGPS has slightly higher vibrational entropy (Fig. 3), as expected from its softer phonons (ω &lt; 100 cm−1). We can therefore, safely say the total entropies ΔSNGPS &gt; ΔSLGPS, which means that the entropic effects are slightly stronger in the sodium compound. Since the energy gain in reaction (7) (for NGPS) is weaker than that of reaction (8) (for LGPS), and the fact that LGPS is stable at room temperature, we expect NGPS to be stabilized by entropic effects at ambient and higher temperatures.

2.Electrochemical window (Eg)
The HSE06 hybrid functional27 has been widely used for electrochemical window (Eg) calculations. Using this functional, Mo et al.11 reported a value of 3.6 V for LGPS which is much lower than the experimentally determined value of 5 V.10 This discrepancy was attributed to a possible passivation phenomenon at the electrode interfaces leading to the formation of compounds such as Li2S at the anode and P2S5 at the cathode, but these reactions have not been observed so far in experiments.10,28 An alternate explanation proposed26 recently is that the addition/removal of Li+ in LGPS, keeping the structural framework intact possibly results in its higher observed electrochemical window. However, the reason for its wider observed electrochemical window is still unclear.
Using the HSE06 hybrid functional, our estimate of Eg for NGPS is 2.7 V, and for LGPS it is 3.2 V (Fig. 4). Our value for LGPS is 0.4 V less than Mo et al.'s calculations. This may be due to the accounting of additional vacant orbitals in the pseudopotentials used in their calculations. Nevertheless, we find that the calculated potential window for NGPS (2.7 V) falls in the range of voltages exhibited by many sodium ion cathodes and sodium sulphur batteries (1.78–2.08 V).6 However, we note the considerable discrepancy between the DFT calculated and experimentally determined values of the bandgap for LGPS, and conclude that one may have to resort to experiments for a more reliable estimate for the structurally similar sodium compound.

3.Ab initio molecular dynamics
We have used ab initio MD to evaluate two main properties: the radial distribution functions and Na+ diffusivities. During these simulations the total energy at all temperatures fluctuated around a constant average which further confirms the stability of the proposed NGPS structure. Fluctuations in the energy per atom varied in the range of 0.4–1% of the mean energy per atom at all the temperatures considered.
(a)Radial distribution functions (g(r))
We examined the radial distribution functions (g(r)) obtained from MD simulations which provide structural information of the material in terms of inter-atomic distances and coordination numbers. Fig. 5 shows partial g(r) of LGPS and NGPS, calculated from the MD trajectories at 800 K. The first and second peaks in both figures occur at 2 and 2.3 Å corresponding to P–S and Ge–S bonds, respectively. This means that the cationic species Na or Li does not affect these bonds. Due to the larger size of Na atoms, Na–X (X = Ge, P, S) distances are longer than the corresponding Li–X distances as expected. As mentioned previously, no single phase involving Na–P–Ge–S is reported in the literature for comparison of the predicted interatomic distances. However, a comparison of Na–X distances can be made with other sulfide based sodium ion conductors available in the literature. Table 2 shows such a comparison with Na2S–GeS2, which has also been studied for electrolyte applications. Itoh and Fukunaga29 investigated the structure of Na2S–GeS2 glass using experimental (shown in Table 2) and reverse Monte Carlo simulation methods. In this material, the Ge–S and Na–S bonds are of two types: with and without common bridging sulphur. The distances compared in Table 2 involve non-bridging sulphur (similar to NGPS).

The distances in NGPS correspond to first peaks in the partial g(r) calculated at 800 K (shown in Fig. 5) (NA in the table refers to the unavailability of the corresponding experimental value)

It consists of a PS4 tetrahedral framework whereas the NGPS structure consists of PS4 and (Ge0.5P0.5)S4; formed by alternately replacing PS4 by GeS4 tetrahedra. Hence it is reasonable to compare the bond distances in the two compounds, and we find that the sodium environments in the two materials are quite similar. It can be seen from Table 2 that the predicted interatomic distances in NGPS are comparable to the corresponding values seen in other similar compounds.
(b)Sodium ionic diffusion coefficients and conductivities
Diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivities are calculated using the equations (2a) and (2b) at four different temperatures: 800, 1000, 1200 and 1400 K. Such high temperatures are considered to achieve quicker convergence, and hence shorten the simulation time (they are seen to converge over a time period of 50 ps). The room-temperature Na-ion diffusivity/conductivity is then obtained by extrapolation from these four points via the Arrhenius plot (shown in Fig. 6a). The Na-ion diffusion coefficients calculated at higher temperatures are compared to those of Li in LGPS in Fig. 7. It is evident that sodium ion diffusivities are higher than those of lithium at temperatures above 1200 K.

The Arrhenius plot of conductivity versus temperature as shown in the Fig. 6a, fits quite well (with a goodness of fit (R2) equal to 99.6%) to a linear curve. From the plot, the extrapolated conductivity at room temperature (300 K) is 4.7 mS cm−1. This is of the same order of magnitude as exhibited by polycrystalline β″-alumina. The activation energy obtained as the slope of the linear plot in Fig. 6a is 0.2 ± 0.0095 eV, a bit lower than that of Li-ion diffusion in LGPS (0.21 eV) calculated from the results at similar temperatures.11 The activation energy (for NGPS) is lower than the typical values exhibited by other ceramic ionic conductors (refer Table 3), which range from 0.25 to 1 eV.8

Furthermore, for both the cases of diffusion considered (axial and planar), Na in NGPS exhibits lower activation energies (0.127 ± 0.022 and 0.251 ± 0.019 eV) than those for Li (0.17 and 0.28 eV) in LGPS as calculated by Mo et al.11 It can be seen from Fig. 6b that diffusion of Na+ is expected to occur predominantly along the c direction at lower temperature.
We now compare the ionic conductivity with different high-Na+ ion conducting solid electrolytes at room temperature and their corresponding activation energies (see Table 3). β-Alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) and NASICON are the two widely used solid electrolytes in high temperature sodium batteries. The conductivities of both the electrolytes depend on the methods of their preparation. BASE exists in two different crystal structures8 – β-alumina (with composition Na2O·(8–11)Al2O3) and β″-alumina (Na2O·(5–7)Al2O3). The latter exhibits higher Na+ ion conductivity (single crystal β″-alumina can exhibit a conductivity of the order of 40–100 mS cm−1, see ref. 33).
Commercial β″-alumina manufactured by Ionotec Ltd exhibits a room temperature conductivity of 2 mS cm−1.8 At 573 K, which is the operating temperature of Na–S batteries, its conductivity is 240 mS cm−1.8 NASICON stands for sodium superionic conductor, and has a generic composition Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12 (0 &lt; x &lt; 3). The Na+ conductivity of NASICON produced by Ceramatec, Inc. (USA) is 3–4 mS cm−1 at room temperature.31 The calculated ionic conductivity in NGPS in the current study is higher than that of both polycrystalline β″-alumina and NASICON at room temperature, but lower at the operating temperature of Na–S or sodium metal chloride batteries.
Sulfides of sodium are an important class of glass/glass–ceramic electrolytes. Their conductivities are however lower than those of BASE and NASICON materials. Hayashi et al.3 demonstrated room-temperature operation of an all-solid-state Na–S battery with a novel glass–ceramic electrolyte containing cubic Na3PS4, which showed a Na+ conductivity of 0.2 mS cm−1. The value is an order of magnitude smaller than that predicted for NGPS. A major advantage of the mentioned sulphide electrolyte is that it formed a good interface with electrodes upon simple cold pressing. Another sulphide based solid electrolyte which enabled such a RT-Na/S battery, but with enhanced capacity, was reported by Nagata et al.5 Tanibata et al.32 reported a room temperature Na+ ion conductivity of 0.74 mS cm−1 for 94Na3PS4–6Na4SiS4, which is the highest value reported so far for sulfides. Compared to both the above mentioned electrolytes and cubic Na3PS4, NGPS is expected to exhibit a better performance in terms of Na-ionic conductivity. However, one should note that solid electrolytes can exhibit different activation energies in different temperature ranges (as seen for BASE and NASICON in Table 3). Hence the activation energy for NGPS may be different (slightly higher) at lower temperatures than the one calculated here, thereby resulting in lower room-temperature conductivity.
