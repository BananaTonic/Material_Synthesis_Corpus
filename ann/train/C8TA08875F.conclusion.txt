Conclusions
In summary, we prepared a solid-state electrolyte for lithium metal batteries by the nanoconfinement of Li-IL within the MCM-41 nanoporous scaffold. Featuring a high specific surface area with a large pore volume to confine enough Li-IL and plentiful nanowetted interfaces, the Li-IL@MCM-41 SSE exhibited a high ionic conductivity of 3.98 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 30 °C. It also possessed a broad electrochemical window and excellent thermal stability. The as-pressed SSE pellets, possessing sufficient mechanical strength, were demonstrated to suppress the dendritic deposition of the Li metal anode by direct SEM evidence. The solid-state batteries based on the Li-IL@MCM-41 SSE exhibited excellent cycling performance, and delivered capacities of 138 mA h g−1, 127 mA h g−1, and 163 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at room temperature at 0.1C for LiFePO4, LiCoO2, and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, respectively. The Li-IL@MCM-41 SSE was proved to establish efficient interfacial ion transport with different cathode materials and had a stable interface towards the lithium metal anode favoured by its nanowetted interfaces. This work has provided a promising approach to the design of novel solid-state electrolytes for lithium metal batteries.
