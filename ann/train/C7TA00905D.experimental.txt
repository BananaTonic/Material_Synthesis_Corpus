Synthesis of N-allylpiperidine
N-Allylpiperidine was obtained by condensing piperidine with allyl bromide. A 250 mL round bottom flask, equipped with a magnetic stir bar and an addition funnel, was charged with sodium hydroxide (14.5 g, 0.36 mol) and water (20 mL). The mixture was stirred at 0 °C until all the sodium hydroxide was dissolved. Piperidine (30 mL, 0.30 mol) was then added to the aqueous solution and the addition funnel was charged with allyl bromide (26.3 mL, 0.30 mol). Allyl bromide was slowly added to the ice cold solution over a period of 30 minutes and then allowed to warm to room temperature for an additional 1.5 hours. The resulting oil layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted once with chloroform and combined with the oil. The chloroform was evaporated and the product distilled from sodium hydroxide at room temperature under 100 mtorr vacuum producing a colorless liquid (35.6 g, 93.7% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.89 (1H, ddt, 17.0 Hz, 10.3 Hz, 6.6 Hz), 5.16 (1H, d, 17.0 Hz), 5.12 (1H, d, 10.3 Hz), 2.96 (2H, d, 6.6 Hz), 2.37 (4H, bS), 1.59 (4H, quin, 5.3 Hz), 1.42 (2H, bt, 5.3 Hz).
Synthesis of N,N-diallylpiperidinium chloride (DApipCl)
The synthesis of N,N-diallylpiperidinium chloride was accomplished by the nucleophilic substitution of N-allylpiperidine with allyl chloride.47 A 250 mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar was charged with N-allylpiperidine (35.6 g, 0.284 mol), allyl chloride (29.0 mL, 0.356 mol), and water (55 mL). The flask was sealed with a rubber septum that was secured with copper wire. The two-phase reaction was stirred vigorously at 65 °C for 2 days. The resulting oil layer was separated and the aqueous phase washed once with diethyl ether, combined with the oil layer and concentrated by rotary evaporation. Acetone (200 mL) was added to the resulting viscous oil and a white precipitate formed. The white solid was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum at 200 mtorr (37.6 g, 66.5% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): δ 5.85 (2H, m), 5.45 (4H, m), 3.76 (4H, d, 10 Hz), 3.18 (4H, m), 1.74 (4H, s), 1.51 (2H, s). 13C NMR (125 MHz, D2O): δ 128.7, 124.1, 61.0, 58.4, 20.7, 19.3. HRMS (EI) for [C11H20ClN]+: calculated 201.1284, found 201.1238.
Synthesis of bis(4-fluorophenyl) disulfide
Synthesis of bis(4-fluorophenyl) disulfide was accomplished by oxidation of 4-fluorothiophenol.48 A 25 mL round bottom flask was charged with 4-fluorothiophenol (2.39 g, 0.018 mol), Cu(ii)Cl (28 mg, 0.16 mmol), TMEDA (54 μL, 0.36 mmol), and THF (5 mL). Oxygen was bubbled through the reaction mixture for 1 hour and the flask was subsequently sealed with a septum under an oxygen atmosphere. The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature, and then filtered through a plug of activated alumina and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. The resulting yellow oil was dissolved in chloroform, washed twice with aqueous KOH (10 wt%), dried over MgSO4 and the chloroform removed by rotary evaporation. The remaining material was crystallized from methanol (1.17 g, 51.3% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.44 (4H, dd, 8.60 Hz, 5.16 Hz) 7.01 (4H, t, 8.60 Hz). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3): δ 163.7, 161.7, 132.3, 132.2, 131.4, 131.3, 116.5, 116.3.
Oxidation of 4-fluorothioanisole to 4-fluorophenylmethyl sulfone
Synthesis of 4-fluorophenylmethyl sulfone was adapted from a literature procedure.49 In a 15 mL round bottom flask containing a magnetic stir bar, 4-fluorothioanisole (0.210 g, 1.50 mmol) and Oxone (1.36 g, 2.21 mmol) were suspended in 3 mL water. The suspension was heated at 60 °C and stirred overnight. Upon cooling, a white solid precipitated and was collected by filtration. The recovered solid was then dissolved in a minimum of hot methanol. Water was carefully added until turbid and the mixture was cooled to effect crystallization. The obtained white solid was filtered and dried (0.203 g, 79% yield) λmax (acetonitrile)/nm 216 (ε/dm3 mol−1 cm−1 7800) 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.96 (2H, m), 7.24 (2H, m), 3.05 (3H, s).
Synthesis of 4-fluorophenyl sulfide terminated poly(N,N-diallylpiperidinium chloride) (PDApipCl)
The synthesis of telechelic PDApipCl oligomers was designed to produce materials of relatively low molecular weight bearing 4-fluorophenyl sulfide end groups. A typical synthesis was as follows: DApipCl (12.6 g, 62.5 mmol) was taken up in a 1 : 1 solution of water and methanol and diluted to 25 mL in a volumetric flask, producing a 2.5 M stock monomer solution. A 10 mL test tube with a magnetic stir bar was charged with bis(4-fluorophenyl) disulfide (50.8 mg, 0.20 mmol) and DApipCl (4.03 g, 20 mmol, 8.0 mL of stock solution). The test tube was septum sealed and the suspension was purged with nitrogen in an ice bath for 30 min. The reaction tube was placed in a stainless-steel beaker containing silicon oil maintained at 60 °C on a hot plate. The lid for the beaker was designed such that a UV pen light (254 nm) would sit in the middle of the beaker with the reaction tubes approximately 2 cm away. The reaction was allowed to warm for 10 minutes and then the UV light was illuminated. The polymerization was carried out for 24 hours with constant UV radiation. The viscous solution was then precipitated into acetone and the resulting white solid was collected, dissolved in methanol and again precipitated into acetone. The final white powder was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with acetone, and dried at 80 °C under vacuum (1.91 g, 47% yield) 1H NMR (500 MHz, D2O): δ 7.44 (4H, m), 7.08 (4H, m), 3.84 (2H, bs), 3.32 (4H, m), 3.10 (2H, bs), 2.53 (2H, bs), 2.10 (2H, bs), 1.79 (4H, bs), 1.57 (2H, bs), 1.47 (2H, bs), 1.23 (2H, bs). 13C NMR (125 MHz, D2O): δ 68.3, 67.0, 63.9, 63.4, 60.3, 42.3, 37.8, 29.5, 26.2, 21.6, 21.2, 20.7.
Oxidation of 4-fluorophenyl sulfide terminated (PDApipCl) and ion metathesis to hexafluorophosphate
4-Fluorophenyl sulfide terminated PDApipCl (2.43 g, 0.22 mmol sulfide end groups) was introduced into a 25 mL round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and 5 mL water and stirred until dissolved. Oxone (270 mg, 0.44 mmol) was added to the solution and stirred until homogenous. The reaction mixture was heated at 60 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation and then precipitated into acetone. The white solid was dissolved in 5 mL water and precipitated into a saturated solution of aqueous potassium hexafluorophosphate. The white solid was collected by filtration and washed with copious amounts of water and dried at 80 °C under vacuum (1.96 g recovered).
Synthesis of polysulfone–PDApipPF6 multiblock copolymers
The multiblock copolymers were synthesized to achieve a targeted weight percent incorporation of PDApip. The weight percent of PDApip incorporated was between 16 and 40%, calculated in the hydroxide form. A representative procedure (sample PSf–PDApip3) is as follows: a 25 mL 3-neck round bottom flask fitted with an overhead stir motor, Dean–Stark trap prefilled with toluene, condenser and a nitrogen inlet was charged with bisphenol A (0.653 g, 2.86 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.059 g, 4.30 mmol), DMAc (9.8 mL) and toluene (3 mL). The reaction flask was heated under nitrogen in a 150 °C oil bath to remove water to the Dean–Stark trap for 3 hours and then cooled to room temperature. Bis(4-fluorophenyl) sulfone (0.700 g, 2.75 mmol) and 4-fluorophenyl sulfone terminated PDApipPF6 (1.10 g, 0.10 mmol end groups) were added. The reaction was then heated to reflux for 3 hours, during which time the viscosity of the reaction dramatically increased. The solution was diluted with an additional 9 mL DMAc, cooled to room temperature and precipitated into methanol. The resulting off-white fibers were collected by filtration and stirred in water overnight to remove any residual salts. The multiblock copolymer was collected by filtration, washed with methanol, and dried at 80 °C under vacuum (2.22 g, 95% yield).
Membrane fabrication
PSf–PDApipPF6 membranes were fabricated by casting the multiblock copolymer solution onto a glass substrate. Polymer solutions were 15% w/v of copolymer in DMAc and were filtered through a plug of glass wool prior to casting. The polymer solutions were deposited onto a glass sheet and were made uniform with a doctor blade set to 750 μm. The glass was heated to 75 °C on a hotplate to slowly evaporate solvent. PSf–PDApipPF6 membranes were removed from the substrate by soaking in water. The free-standing membranes were then dried under vacuum.
Ion exchange to hydroxide
Ion exchange to hydroxide was accomplished by first exchanging to chloride and then to hydroxide. The PSf–PDApipPF6 membranes were immersed in a saturated solution of ammonium chloride and heated in a 100 °C oil bath for 48 hours. Following ion exchange to chloride, PSf–PDApipCl membranes were then immersed in 2 M potassium hydroxide for 48 hours to complete the ion exchange to hydroxide. The resulting membranes were washed with successive nitrogen-purged deionized water baths until a neutral pH was obtained.
Characterization and measurements
Molecular structures and polymer compositions were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy on a JEOL ECA-500 FT-NMR using CDCl3, deuterium oxide, DMSO-d6 or acetonitrile-d3 as solvent. The NMR chemical shift values (δ) were referenced using residual solvent signals.
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy was performed with a Thermo Electron Corporation Evolution 300 PC spectrophotometer and was used for end group analysis of the PDApip oligomers. All measurements were made in quartz cuvettes between 200 and 400 nm and were referenced against pure solvents. Samples were prepared with either methanol or acetonitrile to approximately 0.1 wt% solutions. The presence of 4-fluorophenyl sulfide and 4-fluorophenyl sulfone was detected at wavelengths of 251 nm and 216 nm, respectively.
Thermal transitions were measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on a TA Instruments Q20 DSC. Samples were prepared in T-zero aluminum pans and measured from 30–250 °C for 3 cycles. The heating rate was 10 °C per minute and the cooling rate was 40 °C per minute. The third heating was used to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg).
Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) was used to observe the surface morphology of the PSf–PDApipPF6 membranes. Images were obtained from an Oxford Instruments AFM 3D utilizing a 42 N m−1 silicon Pointprobe tip (purchased from Nanoworld). PSf–PDApipPF6 multiblock copolymer solutions were made from DMAc at a 0.2% w/v concentration and drop cast onto 1 cm2 silicon wafers. The silicon wafers were then dried overnight on a 75 °C hot plate. Prior to AFM analysis, the PSf–PDApipPF6 coated wafers were allowed to equilibrate to ambient temperature and humidity. The amplitude set-point ratio (rsp) was set to 0.6 and the driving amplitude (A0) was set to 1 V. Height and phase images of all samples were collected under ambient humidity and temperature.
Tensile properties of PSf–PDApipCl multiblock copolymers were measured using a Mark-10 ESM1500 test stand equipped with a 250 N load cell, having a 0.1 N resolution. Each membrane was stretched at a rate of 10 mm min−1. Membrane samples were cut and the dimensions measured exactly (roughly 50 μm in thickness, 6 mm in width and 20 mm in length). Each membrane was allowed to equilibrate to ambient humidity for 24 hours. The relative humidity at the time of measurement was approximately 25%.
The ion exchange capacity (IEC) of the PSf–PDApipCl multiblock copolymer membranes was determined using the Mohr titration method. Membrane samples, previously exchanged to the chloride form, were washed and dried at 80 °C for 24 hours to obtain the dry mass. An accurately weighed dried membrane was immersed in 40 mL of 1 M sodium nitrate and soaked for 24 hours. The solution was diluted to 50 mL in a volumetric flask and five 9 mL aliquots were titrated with a standardized 0.04955 M silver nitrate solution with potassium chromate as indicator. The ion exchange capacity was determined from the following formula:where VT and CT are the volume and concentration of the silver nitrate titrant, VA and VS are the volume of the aliquot and initial solution, respectively, and MD is the dry mass of the membrane.
Percentage of water uptake (WU%) for the membranes was determined gravimetrically in the hydroxide form. Membranes were converted to the hydroxide form, washed to neutral pH, and dried under vacuum (∼200 mtorr) for 24 hours to obtain a dry mass (MD). The membranes were then soaked in degassed 18 MΩ water under a nitrogen atmosphere at a given temperature. The hydrated membrane mass (MW) was determined by quickly wiping off surface water, obtaining the mass and re-soaking. Each membrane was measured 4 times at each temperature and the percent water uptake was determined by the following equation:
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to determine the in-plane hydroxide conductivity. A Biologic VMP3 potentiostat using a 4-probe Teflon cell with platinum electrodes, immersed in nitrogen-purged 18 MΩ water and measuring in a frequency range of 300 kHz to 100 Hz was used. Membranes were measured against a Nafion 117 standard to validate the data. A Bode plot was used to validate the frequency range with constant impedance. The intercept on the real resistance axis in the Nyquist plot was taken as the membrane resistance. The ionic conductivity of the membranes was determined by the following calculation:where σ is the ionic conductivity in S cm−1, d is the distance between the reference electrodes in cm, W and T represent the width and thickness in cm for the membrane at room temperature under fully hydrated conditions and R is the measured resistance (Ω) of the membrane.
The alkaline stability of the PDApipOH homopolymer was determined by adapting a previously established method.7 A 5 mL Teflon vial was charged with PDApipCl (0.101 g, 0.50 mmol), potassium hydroxide (0.115 g, 2.05 mmol) and nitrogen-purged methanol-d4 (2 mL), generating a 1 M solution in hydroxide and a 3-fold excess of base. The Teflon vial was further purged with nitrogen, sealed and placed in an 80 °C oil bath for 42 days. Samples were measured by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 0, 7, and 42 days and analyzed for the presence of degradation products.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of both the PDApip homopolymer and PSf–PDApip multiblock copolymers was accomplished with a Seiko TG/DTA 320 Thermal Analyzer with a RT Instruments software upgrade. Measurements were run under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C per minute. Samples in the hexafluorophosphate form were heated to 150 °C to drive off residual water, then cooled and measured. Samples in either the chloride or hydroxide form were heated at 60 °C for an hour, cooled and measured.
The conductivity stability of the membranes at elevated temperature was also evaluated. PSf–PDApipOH membranes were immersed in a nitrogen-purged 1 M potassium hydroxide solution at 80 °C for 5 days. After immersion, the membranes were washed with degassed, 18 MΩ water repeatedly until a neutral pH was obtained and their hydroxide conductivity at 80 °C was measured.
