Conclusions
B-site doping in a lanthanum ferrate perovskite has been adopted to increase the conductivity and stability under fuel conditions of an SOFC at 800 °C. It was found that substituting 20% of the Fe3+ sites with Mg2+ enhanced the ionic conductivity (above 0.01 S cm−1) and suppressed the electronic conduction of the perovskite under a reducing atmosphere. The co-doping of Mg2+/Ti4+ and Ni2+/Ti4+ increased the electronic conductivity by promoting and stabilizing the Fe3+/Fe2+ratio, though the production of Ti3+ under a reducing atmosphere at 800 °C could also contribute to the high conductivity in the LFNT perovskite (c.a. 100 S cm−1). The cell with the LFNT anode showed small Rp values (0.32 to 0.35 Ω cm2) at 800 °C and this could be related to the surface exsolution of Ni particles of 20–30 nm diameter. With a slight infiltration of CeO2 into the LFNT anode, a power of 600 W cm2 at 800 °C could be obtained even with an LSGM electrolyte of 350 μm thickness.
