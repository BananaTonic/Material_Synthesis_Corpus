Polymer electrolytes for lithium polymer batteries
In this review, state-of-the-art polymer electrolytes are discussed with respect to their electrochemical and physical properties for their application in lithium polymer batteries. We divide polymer electrolytes into the two large categories of solid polymer electrolytes and gel polymer electrolytes (GPE). The performance requirements and ion transfer mechanisms of polymer electrolytes are presented at first. Then, solid polymer electrolyte systems, including dry solid polymer electrolytes, polymer-in-salt systems (rubbery electrolytes), and single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes, are described systematically. Solid polymer electrolytes still suffer from poor ionic conductivity, which is lower than 10−5 S cm−1. In order to further improve the ionic conductivity, numerous new types of lithium salt have been studied and inorganic fillers have been incorporated into solid polymer electrolytes. In the section on gel polymer electrolytes, the types of plasticizer and preparation methods of GPEs are summarized. Although the ionic conductivity of GPEs can reach 10−3 S cm−1, their low mechanical strength and poor interfacial properties are obstacles to their practical application. Significant attention is paid to the incorporation of inorganic fillers into GPEs to improve their mechanical strength as well as their transport properties and electrochemical properties.
