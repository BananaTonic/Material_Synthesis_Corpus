Experimental
Materials
4,4-Diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI) was obtained from Suzhou Industrial Park Bomida Reagents Instrument Co. Ltd., China. Polycaprolactone glycol (PCL–OH, Mn = 1000) was purchased from Yutai Haina Environmental Protection Technology Co. Ltd, China. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs, average diameter of 8–15 nm, length &lt; 50 μm, purity ≥ 95%) were bought from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chengdu Organic Chemistry Co. Ltd., China. aCNTs were prepared following the method reported in the literature.22N-Carbamoylmaleimide (NCM, Industrial grade) was bought from Honghu Shuangma New Material Co. Ltd., China. Other reagents, including furfurylamine (99%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, AR), ethanol, γ-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane (KH560, 98%), concentrated nitric acid (65–68%), toluene (AR), ether (AR) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (≥20%), were all commercial products and used as received.
Synthesis of HSiNCM
NCM (2.24 g, 0.016 mol), KH560 (3.776 g, 0.016 mol) and toluene (100 mL) were blended in a flask with stirring, which was then maintained at 55 °C for 8 h under a N2 atmosphere to obtain a crude product. After removing toluene by vacuum distillation, silylated N-carbamoyl maleimide (KH560-N) was obtained.
Deionized water (0.3456 g, 0.0192 mol), ethanol (40 mL) and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (0.01 g) were added into KH560-N. The pH value of the mixture was adjusted to be higher than 7, and the mixture was maintained at 55 °C for 3.5 h. Through vacuum distillation, ethanol was removed, and a yellow liquid was obtained, which was hyperbranched polysiloxane with maleimide groups (HSiNCM). Its Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectra are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI, respectively.
Synthesis of PU with multi-furan groups (FPU)
FPU was synthesized through a two-step conventional method. Firstly, MDI (4.0 g, 0.016 mol) was made to reacted with PCL–OH (8.0 g, 0.008 mol) using DMF (10 mL) as the solvent in a three necked round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel. The reaction was carried out at 60 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere for 3 h and then cooled in an ice-water bath to obtain a NCO-terminated PU prepolymer (MBM) solution. Secondly, furfuryl amine (0.8 g, 0.008 mol) was dropwise added into the MBM solution within 10 min; 30 min later, the temperature was increased and kept at 100 °C for 10 h. After cooling to room temperature, the whole solution was poured into excess diethyl ether to purify FPU. After filtering and drying under vacuum at room temperature, a yellow solid polymer with multi-furan rings was obtained, coded as FPU.
Synthesis of PU-DA-CNT films
According to Table 1, aCNTs and HSiNCM were mixed by stirring for 30 min to form the initial solution, into which FPU was added. After stirring at 50 °C for 4 h, the final solution was poured into a mould. The mould was put in a blast oven and maintained at 50 °C for 48 h to obtain a cross-linked PU film, coded as PU-DA-CNTx, where x takes values from 1 to 5 according to the loading of aCNTs.

FTIR spectra were obtained using a spectrometer (NICOLET 5700, USA).
1H-NMR spectra were recorded with a superconducting magnetic resonance spectrometer (UNITY INOVA 400 MHz, Varian, USA). Deuterated DMSO-d6 was used as the solvent.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were conducted on a thermal analyzer (DSC 2910, TA Instruments, USA) from −60 °C to 200 °C for heating and cooling cycles at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen flow. Before DSC tests, the samples were eliminated the thermal history.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed on a thermogravimetric analyzer (Discovery TGA, USA) at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 from room temperature to 800 °C under a N2 atmosphere.
The molecular weight and polydispersity (PDI) of polymers were determined with a Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) instrument equipped with three ultrahydrogel columns following an INLINE precolumn and a differential refractive-index detector. The measurements were performed using DMF containing 1 wt% LiBr as an eluent with a flow rate of 0.8 mL min−1 at 30 °C and a series of narrow polystyrene standards for the calibration of the columns.
Cracks (made by blades) on the surfaces of samples were observed under a polarizing optical microscope (POM, CPV-900C, China) equipped with a temperature programmed heating stage to evaluate the healable properties under a N2 flow. The temperature was increased at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Photographs were taken at different time intervals during the heating process.
The breaking (tensile) strengths were measured using a universal testing machine (KQL, China) controlled by a computer according to Chinese standard GB/T1447-2005 at an elongation rate of 5 mm min−1. The specimens were dumbbell-like with dimensions of (20 ± 0.5) mm × (10 ± 0.2) mm × (1 ± 0.1) mm. Tensile strengths were calculated using the integrated area of the stress–strain curves. The self-healing efficiencies were calculated based on the recovery of tensile strength following eqn (1).23–251
The surface resistance was measured with a surface resistance tester (AS907/AS907A, China). The specimens were square with dimensions of (45 ± 0.5) mm × (45 ± 0.5) mm × (1 ± 0.1) mm.
Electric conductivities were tested using a four-probe method (ST2258, China). Each sample was circular with a diameter of (1 ± 0.1) cm.
Static decay rates were measured on an electrostatic decay tester (HO110 V2, Japan). The dimensions of each sample were (45 ± 1) mm × (45 ± 1) mm × (1 ± 0.1) mm. Before testing, samples were put into a dehumidification box (20 ± 0.5 °C, humidity &lt; 35 ± 1%) for at least 24 h.
