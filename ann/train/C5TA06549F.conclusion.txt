Conclusions
In this study we investigated the electrochemical and photophysical properties of Li2B12H12 demonstrating that it is a unique bi-functional material. A series of electrochemical measurements demonstrated that altering the morphology of Li2B12H12 by mechanical milling produced a fast Li ionic conductor in the solid state with exceptional ionic conductivity at room temperature. It was successfully used as an electrolyte in an all solid state battery that can be reversibly cycled at temperatures as low as 30 °C. We are currently developing a methodology to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2B12H12 in order to operate battery cells at temperatures and discharge–charge capacities that exceed common organic liquid electrolytes. We also measured the photophysical properties of the material in a variety of solvents and found that it had an emission maximum at ∼460 nm with a large Stokes' shift. A PVA/Li2B12H12 thin film was prepared on glass and was successfully used as a transparent head-up display by down-shifting incident UV light into the visible spectrum to display a bright blue image. The water soluble nature of Li2B12H12, makes it simpler to infuse a polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) thin films and the process can be easily scaled up to form a large scale transparent head up display. This finding indicates that the B12H122− anion can potentially be used as a building block and component of new light emitting dyes in the solid and solution state.
