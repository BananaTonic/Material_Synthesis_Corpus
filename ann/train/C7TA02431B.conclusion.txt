4.Conclusions
We obtained lustrous conductive carbon thin films on quartz substrates via pyrolysis of PTCDA under different temperatures, and investigated their thermoelectric properties. Among the films obtained at five pyrolytic temperatures, the films obtained at 530 °C and 600 °C showed relatively better thermoelectric properties and characteristic semi-conducting behaviour. From the UV-vis spectroscopy characterisations, the direct bandgaps of PPN530 and PPN600 were determined to be 0.37 eV and 0.36 eV, respectively. Pyrolysation of PTCDA offers a simple and practical way to synthesise large-scale conducting carbon films with narrow bandgaps, and shows promising prospects for industrialisation. In addition, the conducting PPN films may find applications in other fields of organic electronics, considering their stable electron transport properties under ambient conditions.
