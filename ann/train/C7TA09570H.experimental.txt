Phase formation and RT structures
The XRD peaks of the series sintered at 1623 K revealed solid-solution formation for the whole series with somewhat broad peaks suggesting cubic or pseudo-cubic perovskite phases. On sintering at 1723 K, sharper peaks indicated both enhanced crystallinity and more complex structural detail, with peak splitting particularly apparent for the Pr-rich end of the series.
Tilting of the octahedra in the perovskite structure gives rise to superlattice reflections associated with concerted oxygen movements, which are typically imperceptible to XRD due to the low X-ray oxygen scattering factor. Similarly, any slight distortion of the cation substructure may give rise to peak splitting which is difficult to observe by laboratory-diffraction techniques. High-resolution neutron powder diffraction is, thus, one of the most useful tools for precise determination of the space group in perovskites which display subtle phase transitions. This has been demonstrated for the end-member phases of the present series,20,27 which reach cubic symmetry on heating through three or four transitions in the sequence Pnma → Imma →  → Pm3̄m for BZCY72 (Imma at RT) and BaPr0.9Y0.1O3−δ (Pnma at RT), respectively.
The NPD patterns of the series revealed distortions from the cubic perovskite aristotype as indicated by the presence of superlattice reflections, shown in Fig. 1 for x = 0.225 and x = 0.445. Indexing of these peaks in accordance with the method of Glazer28 and Woodward and Reaney29 followed a 1/2{o o o} pattern on the basis of the simple cubic unit cell, where ‘o’ represents an odd-number index. This type of reflection is compatible with antiphase tilting only of the octahedra, limiting the possible space groups to I4/mcm, Imma and .30 The final choice of symmetry was made on analysis of the superstructure reflections originating from the distortion of the cubic perovskite phase, and inspection of the corresponding quality criteria of the refinement.

The panels indicate superstructure reflections with a 1/2{o o o} indexation (where “o” indicates an index with an odd number) resulting from antiphase tilting.
Fitting of the NPD data was performed using the appropriate orthorhombic, rhombohedral or cubic structural model, employing the nominal cation stoichiometries. No superlattice reflections related to a possible cation ordering on the perovskite B site were identified. Refinements were thus carried out assuming a statistical distribution of the B-site cations. Assuming the IV valence state for all B-site cations except Y3+, the nominal oxygen stoichiometry is expected to be 2.95. Refinement of the oxygen occupancies was performed leading to values which were generally higher than this nominal value, particularly in the low-temperature range below 573 K (Table 1). This less-than-nominal oxygen deficiency may be due to partial hydration under normal synthesis conditions:1as occurs for the Pr-free BZCY72 end-member phase.27 However, oxygen occupancies may also increase due to oxidation according to the following defect equilibrium:2

Accordingly, high oxygen occupancies at lower temperatures indicate that the Pr and Ce cations are likely to be in the IV oxidation state; this is discussed in more detail in the following section. The fittings were also noticeably improved on employment of anisotropic temperature factors. The final structural parameters of the RT phases of x = 0.225, 0.445 and 0.9 are presented in Table 1. The observed and calculated NPD patterns of the series at RT and their differences are shown in Fig. 2.

Magnetic measurements and Pr oxidation state
Increasing magnetic susceptibility with decreasing temperature is observed in the Ba(Zr0.7Ce0.2)1−(x/0.9)PrxY0.1O3−δ series, Fig. 3, revealing paramagnetism ranging down to 2 K for compositions x = 0.225 and x = 0.445 but only to 6 K and 9.5 K for x = 0.675 and x = 0.9, respectively. For the last two phases, a sharp increase of χ at these temperatures denotes the onset of magnetic interactions, most probably similar to those found in BaPrO3, which develops antiferromagnetic ordering with a weak ferromagnetic component at 11.7 K.31 The partial substitution of paramagnetic Pr4+ cations by diamagnetic Y3+ in BPO (x = 0.9) and diamagnetic species Zr4+/Ce4+ and Y3+ in the other series members is likely to account for the fall in the ordering temperature and the paramagnetic behavior down to 2 K. On the other hand, the χ−1vs. T plot for the four samples (inset of Fig. 3) is not linear, indicating that χ follows a Curie–Weiss law together with a temperature-independent contribution in the paramagnetic region:3where C is the Curie constant corresponding to the Pr4+ ion, θ is the Weiss temperature expressing the exchange interactions between such ions and χ0 is the so-called Van Vleck paramagnetism or temperature-independent paramagnetism (TIP) associated with Pr4+. The best fit of the χ vs. T curves above 60 K to the function expressed in eqn (3) yields the fitting parameters listed in Table 2, which includes the magnetic moment per mole of Pr, μ, calculated from the experimental Curie constant. The high value of χ0 obtained for the four samples is typical of a Pr4+ ion in an octahedral site where the crystal field and spin–orbit interaction effects are comparable.32 This situation can further reduce the magnetic moment of Pr4+ to a value much smaller than 2.54 μB, expected for a free Pr4+ ion in its J = 5/2 ground state.33 The small values of the experimental μ (Table 2) are consistent with the values of ∼0.70 μB (ref. 32 and 34) and ∼0.85 μB (ref. 35 and 36) previously obtained from magnetic-susceptibility measurements of BaPrO3. The analysis of the magnetic data obtained for the series denotes, therefore, the presence of praseodymium exclusively in a tetravalent state as paramagnetic cation located in an octahedral site. We note that Pr4+ on the perovskite A site is expected to have a magnetic moment closer to 2.54.36

The phase transitions exhibited with composition at RT result from increasing tilting of the layers of the BO6 octahedra with increasing Pr content. This may be understood on the basis that the A ions are progressively undersized and the Goldshmidt tolerance factor (t) becomes increasingly lower:4where rA, rB and rO refer to the ionic radii of A, B and oxide ions respectively.37 The effect of temperature is to partially release the stress associated with the mismatch of the A–O and B–O bond lengths through their differentiated expansion leading to higher symmetry structures.
The phase transitions, which occur on heating selected compositions in the title series in the temperature range RT – 1173 K, were studied by NPD using the same diagnostic procedure for indexation and determination of space group as employed earlier. As expected from consideration of the tolerance factor, high-symmetry phases are stabilized at high temperature and for lower Pr content.
The transformation to cubic symmetry which occurs for all series members may be followed with increasing temperature on calculation of the octahedral tilt angle (ϕ) from the refined oxygen position of the hexagonal cell.38 The temperature dependence of ϕ provides information on the continuous transition from  to Pm3̄m, which may be second-order or tricritical in nature according to whether ϕ follows a (Tc − T)β temperature dependency with exponent of 0.5 or 0.25, respectively.39 The linear relationship near the transition temperature observed between ϕ2 and T in the case of x = 0.445 (Fig. 4) indicates that the dependency of the tilt angle with temperature is better fit with an exponent of β = 0.5 in accordance with a second-order phase transition in this case.

Thermal evolution in air and CO2
The pseudo-cubic lattice parameters of the series, determined from either NPD data collected in low vacuum or SR-XRD data in synthetic air, are shown in Fig. 5. As observed in our previous work of the BZCY72 end-member,27 the Vegard's plots exhibit non-linear behaviour, particularly apparent for the Ce/Zr-rich members, which may be attributable to more than one factor. The expansion followed by contraction on heating exhibited for the end-member BZCY72 phase has been ascribed to a dehydration, which occurs for other proton-conducting perovskites;40,41 a similar dehydration may occur for the x = 0.225 phase up to 573 K. We note that recent computer simulations indicate that chemical expansion results only from radius expansion of the reduced cation, whereas the formation of an oxygen vacancy leads to an opposing effect.42 When the loss of water results from dehydration (eqn (1)), with no reduction occurring, we may, thus, expect the volume contraction shown in Fig. 5 for x = 0 and x = 0.225. Later members of the series do not exhibit a pronounced non-linearity although deviations may arise on undergoing a first-order phase transformation from orthorhombic to rhombohedral symmetry. Thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) are listed in Table 3 for a low-temperature (LT) range, in which the samples may, to varying degrees, retain a non-trivial amount of water from hydration (eqn (1)), and a high temperature (HT) state, in the range 873–1173 K, after the dehydration event. The expansion on heating, most notable for the early series members, is greater in the hydrated state, which is also the case for proton-conducting BaCe0.8Y0.2O2.9; interestingly, however, BaZrO3-based phases exhibit the opposite effect.41 In the high-temperature regime, there is a clear effect of Pr addition increasing TEC. This may be partly due to some reduction of Pr accompanied by oxygen loss at high temperature, which increases with x. However, the effect on lattice parameters appears to be very slight, suggesting such reduction is minimal. The much less apparent contraction on heating (Fig. 5) and converging of HT and LT TEC values (Table 3) of later series members may be understood to result from the lesser tendency towards hydration of BaPrO3-based perovskites. This may seem surprising, considering that, in BaBO3 perovskites, there is generally a greater propensity towards hydration with increasing ionic radius (basicity) of the B cation.43 However, several studies have shown that hydration and proton transport in BaPrO3-based phases is inherently poor.24,25,44

Nevertheless, in accordance with the thermo-diffraction data, significant mass loss due to reduction of Pr4+ or Ce4+ species at higher temperature was not observed. In contrast, the TGA curves for samples x = 0.675 and x = 0.9 measured in CO2 (Fig. 6) exhibited significant weight gain at ∼800 K. X-ray diffraction of post-analysis samples indicated that reaction to form barium carbonate had taken place according to:5BaPrO3 + CO2 → BaCO3 + PrO2

This result is similar to that of the Ba(Zr,Pr,Gd)O3−δ system,25,45 which is also increasingly less stable with greater Pr content. The poorer stability may be understood with reference to the present case on the basis that substitution of Ce/Zr for the Pr cation increases the average B cation radius, forming a more ionic B–O bond in which oxygen is more likely to act as an electron donor and react with acidic gases. Moreover, the effect of the substitution is to lower the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (eqn (4)), generally associated with poorer phase stability.46 An increasing Pr content on the B site, with larger ionic radii than the substituted Ce/Zr ratio, lowers tolerance factor with increasing x. In the same way, placing Pr with lower ionic radius than Ba on the A site decreases t. We note that the tolerance factor and phase stability would be even lower for Pr in the III oxidation state on either A or B sites of the perovskite. Conversely, it may be suggested that the higher tolerance towards carbonation at high temperature results from increasing experimental tolerance factor as the mismatch between A–O and B–O bonds is reduced.
Electrical conductivity
Arrhenius plots for the total conductivity of the Ba(Zr0.7Ce0.2)1−(x/0.9)PrxY0.1O3−δ series in dry N2 and air are shown in Fig. 7, with corresponding activation energies listed in Table 4. In both atmospheres, substitution of Zr/Ce for Pr in the range 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 raises conductivity by 1–3 orders of magnitude at low temperature. A similar increase has been observed in the BaZr1−xPrxO3−δ solid solution,23 as well as related acceptor-doped systems such as BaZr0.9−xPrxGd0.1O3−δ.25 Electrical transport in the acceptor-doped BaPrO3-based phase is attributed to electron holes.20,47 The substantial increase in conductivity with Pr content may be understood, therefore, to arise from increasing electronic conductivity. For all members of the series, conductivity is significantly higher in dry air in comparison to N2 in the intermediate- and high-temperature regimes (Fig. 7(c) and (d)). However, at lower temperatures, the conductivity values in dry N2 approach those obtained in dry air for all compositions. The Pr-free BZCY72 end member is a mixed ionic-electronic conductor under dry conditions of air and N2.48 The lower total conductivity observed for lower oxygen activities is thus associated to a decrease in the contribution of electron holes. However, the electronic contribution to the conductivity also decreases with lower temperature due to the higher activation energy of electron holes in comparison to oxide ions such that the proportion of ionic conductivity is greater at lower temperatures; consequently, the effect of pO2 on the electrical conductivity is lower.

The electroneutrality requirement under dry conditions (assuming that protonic species are negligible) is expressed as:6
Although the acceptor dopant is electrically balanced by oxygen vacancies and electron holes, the principal electrical transport species in dry air and N2 are the latter, due to their much higher mobility (orders of magnitude) in comparison to that of oxide ions. Moreover, the introduction of Pr in the system has the effect of reducing the oxygen-vacancy concentration, as indicated by the high oxygen contents determined from NPD (Table 1), concomitant with the increase of the electron–hole concentration (eqn (2)). For low temperatures, electron holes may be the main electrical species for charge balancing the acceptor dopant, with corresponding electroneutrality condition7
In this situation, it is likely that the oxidation reaction (eqn (2)) is exothermic for the Pr-doped system, with the effect that oxygen vacancies are not stable at low temperature. The enthalpy change for eqn (2) determined semi-empirically for BaPr0.9Gd0.1O3−δ (ref. 47) supports this hypothesis. The concentration of electron holes is, thus, approximately constant (eqn (7)) and not much affected by pO2, as also observed for BaPr0.9Gd0.1O3−δ.47 With increasing temperature and decreasing oxygen partial pressure, oxygen vacancies are created at the expense of electron holes (eqn (2) is displaced to the left), and participate in maintaining electroneutrality (eqn (6)). Accordingly, the oxygen occupancies refined from NPD data are lower at higher temperature and, the conductivity in dry N2 is consistently lower than that in dry air. At very high temperature, a limiting situation may be reached where oxygen vacancies are the principal charge balancing defects for the acceptor dopant and the electronic conductivity follows a classical 1/4-power-law dependency with pO2, σp ∝ log pO2+1/4.498
The hole species may be considered as residing in the oxygen band rather than resulting from mixed-valence cation states, as indicated by the magnetic measurements and neutron refinements of the oxygen occupancies (Table 1). As was previously stated,47 electrical transport may be readily assigned to a purely small-polaron, thermally-activated model in the measured temperature range. At lower temperature (523–773 K), values of the activation energy for the Pr-doped system lie in the range ∼0.3–0.6 eV (Table 4); slight changes with temperature and atmosphere may be related to different carrier concentration, as stated above. Stokes and Islam50 have modelled O− in BaPrO3 as the conducting species in oxidizing conditions. We note that several, if not all, acceptor-doped proton-conducting perovskites, such as BaCeO3- and SrZrO3-based phases also exhibit significant p-type conductivity in dry oxidising conditions.51,52 An interesting occurrence is that substitution of Ce/Zr with Pr4+, with an ionic radius intermediate between that of Ce4+ and Zr4+ promotes much greater electronic conductivity at the expense of proton conductivity.53
Comparison of conductivities in wet and dry conditions, Fig. 8, reveals slightly lower transport in wet air than dry for the Pr-doped samples (Fig. 8(b)), although the difference between wet and dry conditions is minimal for x = 0.225 (Fig. 8(a)). Such behaviour is again consistent with predominant electron–hole transport due to the consumption of holes with less-mobile protons under wet atmospheres according to9
Temperature dependence of total conductivity for the Ba(Zr0.7Ce0.2)(1−x/0.9)PrxY0.1O3−δ series in dry and wet (∼0.023 atm) air for (a) x = 0 and 0.225 and (b) for x = 0.445, 0.675 and 0.9, and in dry and wet (∼0.023 atm) N2 for (c) x = 0 and 0.225 and (d) for x = 0.445, 0.675 and 0.9.
However, the BZCY sample exhibits greater conductivity in humidified in comparison to dry air at lower temperature, indicative of a considerable protonic contribution to transport (Fig. 8(a)), as has been recently confirmed by an analysis of the transport carriers on varying oxygen and water-vapour partial pressures.48 Similar results are observed in dry and wet N2 for the Pr-doped samples as in air (Fig. 8(d)), with the exception of the x = 0.225 sample (Fig. 8(c)). In this case, the minor Pr addition results in a much lower hole concentration, yielding a considerable oxygen vacancy content (eqn (6)), mainly under reducing conditions of N2, which means that protons are likely to participate in transport in wet conditions, as is the case for the BZCY72 phase. The observance of irregular Vegard behaviour indicative of a dehydration event influencing the lattice parameter of this sample (Fig. 5) supports the premise that protons are influential species on electrical transport in compositions of low Pr content.
The mixed-conducting properties of the Pr-doped BZCY72 system are expected to provide an extended reaction area for the oxidation reaction in PCFCs. Nevertheless, the total conductivity (e.g. 0.4 S cm−1 for x = 0.675 at 1175 K in oxidising conditions) is insufficient in itself for a good electrode performance. A more fruitful strategy could be to employ the title series in a composite cathode along with a phase of high electronic conductivity. The lower Pr content materials (x ≤ 0.445) with better stability in CO2 and expected higher proton transport number are likely to be the most promising candidates for this role.
