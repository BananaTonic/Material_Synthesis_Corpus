Conclusions
Two groups of low-volatility plasticizers are synthesized: both are composed of highly polar cyclic carbonate and more flexible short ethylene oxide chains. Those novel low-volatility plasticizers might replace the organic carbonate solvent used in the lithium-ion battery industry to eliminate the safety problems existing in current rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The combination of ethylene oxide and cyclic carbonate can tune Tg and dielectric constant to optimize σDC. The final performance of the plasticizers is decided by their chemical structure, consequently Tg, dielectric constant and viscosity. The best plasticizer OP62 has the lowest viscosity, the most flexible structure and nearly the highest dielectric constant. Polymer single-ion conductor blends containing those plasticizers and a borate ionomer have conductivity up to 2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C. By mixing with low-volatility polar plasticizers, these ionomers are potential candidates to make safer gel polymer electrolytes for lithium-ion rechargeable battery separators.
