Experimental
Materials
An aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios PH1000) was purchased from HC Stark. MoS2 powder was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), n-butyllithium (1.6 M solution in hexane), anhydrous ethanol (EtOH) and hexane were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Solvents were not further purified before use.
Liquid exfoliation of MoS2 nanosheets
MoS2 nanosheet dispersions were prepared by liquid exfoliation according to the previous literature.19,26 In a typical procedure, a mass of 0.5 g of MoS2 powder was added into 100 mL DMF or NMP (Step A in Fig. 1). The mixtures were sonicated (40 kHz, 600 W) for 3.5 h and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min. The MoS2 nanosheet supernatant dispersions in DMF and NMP were obtained and designated as MoS2-D (0.19 mg mL−1) and MoS2-N (0.23 mg mL−1), respectively. MoS2 nanosheets were also obtained by chemical exfoliation with n-butyllithium as reported previously.33 In brief, 0.5 g of MoS2 powder was dispersed into 5 mL of 1.6 M n-butyllithium solution in hexane for two days under an inert atmosphere. The mixture was then filtered and thoroughly washed with anhydrous hexane five times to remove excess butyllithium. The resultant intercalated powder was exfoliated in deionized water (1.5 mg ml−1), and then sonicated for 1 h (40 kHz, 600 W) and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm several times to remove excess lithium as well as the non-exfoliated MoS2 powder. The MoS2 nanosheet supernatant dispersion in H2O with an estimated concentration of 0.67 mg mL−1 was collected and denoted as MoS2-H.

Fabrication of thin films
Volumes of 200 μL of an aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution were added into specified amounts of as-prepared MoS2 dispersions and the resulting mixtures were sonicated for 1 h (Step B in Fig. 1). The PEDOT:PSS/MoS2 (PM) composite thin films were fabricated with different types of MoS2 dispersions in DMF (PMx-D, where the subscript x is the mass percentage of MoS2 in the dried PM thin film), NMP (PMx-N) and H2O (PMx-H) through direct vacuum filtration (Step C in Fig. 1) with a PVDF membrane (pore size: 0.22 μm). For the PMx-H thin film, a MoS2 dispersion in H2O (8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 34, 43, and 100 μL) was added into 200 μL pristine PEDOT:PSS solution and then diluted with 10 mL anhydrous ethanol to obtain a well-dispersed mixture, which was achieved by filtration. Finally, the as-prepared PM thin films were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 10 h. Pure PEDOT:PSS thin films were prepared by diluting 200 μL pristine PEDOT:PSS in DMF (P-D), NMP (P-N), and EtOH (P-E). The restacked MoS2 nanosheet thin films were obtained via direct filtration of MoS2 dispersions.
Characterization and measurements
The morphologies of the as-prepared thin films were visualized using a JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, Veeco Multimode, Plainview, NY, USA). The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS/MoS2 thin films were measured by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a dual-beam focused ion beam (FIB, Helios 450S, FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were obtained by a PANalytical X'Pert Pro MPD system with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength = 1.54056 Å) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The structures and compositions of the thin films were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi), Raman spectroscopy (HR 800) at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm, and UV-vis spectroscopy (Analytikjena Specord 200).
Electrical conductivity was measured by using a standard four-point probe technique with a Keithley 2700 meter. For the measurement of thermopower, as shown in Scheme S1, a rectangle-shaped thin-film sample (15.0 mm × 5.0 mm) was glued to the two cross-linked glass substrates by using silver paste. A Keithley 2401 source meter sent an electric current into a 1000 ohm resistive heater to produce a temperature difference ΔT across the sample. ΔT was detected by a pair of platinum thermometers (Pt100) fixed to the sample by the silver paste. In order to avoid the influence of heat radiation on Pt100, the heater was located under the high temperature end of the sample. The induced thermoelectric voltage ΔV was measured by using a pair of copper wires glued to the sample by the silver paste. The Seebeck coefficient of the copper wires was ignored during the measurement. A Keithley 2700 meter was used to measure ΔT and ΔV. The whole system was controlled by a computer equipped with LabVIEW software. A constant value of ΔT (5 ± 0.5 K) was achieved by adjusting the output power of the heater. The Seebeck coefficient was defined as S = −ΔV/ΔT.
