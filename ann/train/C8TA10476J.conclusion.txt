Conclusion
Poly (2,5-benzimidazole) (ABPBI) was modified by the formation of lithium imidazolate by complex formation with triethylborane to design ionic B-PBI. Furthermore, it was mixed with BMImTFSI to prepare various composite polymer electrolytes (B-PBI/BMImTFSI (w/w%)) exhibiting high ion conductivity. All these composites showed thermal stability at temperatures in the range of 250–300 °C and an average 10% weight loss temperature (Td10) as high as 350 °C. The solidity of the composites was evaluated by rheological measurements, which revealed that their storage modulus was higher than the loss modulus. The ionic conductivity and Li-ion transference number tLi+ were measured for the composite series and better properties were observed as the BMImTFSI content increases relative to B-PBI. The (25/75) B-PBI/BMImTFSI (w/w%) composite showed the highest ionic conductivity and tLi+ of 8.8 × 10−3 S cm−1 and 0.63, respectively. The LSV measurements revealed that the composites showed a wide potential window of 4.85–5.45 V, which is high enough for high-energy battery applications. The battery performance was evaluated using the (25/75) B-PBI/BMImTFSI (w/w%) composite, and the discharge capacity showed stable profiles at different charge–discharge rates, and even at a high current rate of 2C, more than 53% of the reversible capacity remains as compared with that at the rate of 0.1C. The composite showed a coulombic efficiency of &gt;90% irrespective of the current rate. Furthermore, Li-MNC cathodic half-cells were also fabricated to check high voltage charge–discharge cycling, which also exhibits the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. DEIS was employed as a novel technique to investigate the interfacial properties of the composite electrolyte-based anodic half-cell before and after charge–discharge cycling. The RSEI of the cell decreased after cycling, indicating that cycling resulted in the formation of a stable SEI layer.
