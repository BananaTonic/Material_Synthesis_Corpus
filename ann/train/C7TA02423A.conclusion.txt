4.Conclusions
In this work, poly(diethylene glycol carbonate) dimethacrylate macromonomer was synthesized and an interpenetrating network polymer electrolyte was prepared by in situ polymerization. The polymer electrolyte possessed excellent mechanical properties and interface compatibility with lithium metal anode. Polymer electrolyte IPN-PDEC–LiTFSI20 displayed a decent ionic conductivity of 1.64 × 10−4 S cm−1 and a good electrochemical stability window up to 4.5 V vs. Li+/Li. The LiFePO4/Li cells with all solid polymer electrolyte SPE-PDEC–LiTFSI20 possessed excellent cycle performance, with specific capacity of 139 mA h g−1 and coulombic efficiency of 99% at current intensity of 0.2C at 100 °C. The LiFe0.2Mn0.8PO4/Li cells with IPN-PDEC–LiDFOB15 could work under 4.35 V, and deliver reversible capacity of about 140 mA h g−1 at 0.1C after 100 cycles. In consequence, this interpenetrating network polymer electrolyte based on polycarbonate is a potential candidate for the next generation of high energy density lithium batteries.
