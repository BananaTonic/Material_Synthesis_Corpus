Conclusions
Systematic modelling has been carried out to design fast Na+ ion conductors through optimizing materials chemistry over lattice sites of a layered anti-perovskite like structure, Na4OI2. This results in the discovery of a superb solid electrolyte Na3LiS0.5O0.5I2, which exerts extremely low activation energy for Na+ diffusion, thus permitting a room temperature Na+ conductivity of over 6.3 mS cm−1.
The optimized electrolyte is compatible with the sodium anode both thermodynamically and electrochemically. Depletion of sodium at elevated voltages leads to formation of stable compounds suitable for compatible cathode materials. This enables construction of high capacity full batteries based on graded layers covering electrolyte and cathodes. The theoretical energy density for a graded battery is over 320 W h kg−1, which is fundamental for high performance solid sodium ion batteries.
