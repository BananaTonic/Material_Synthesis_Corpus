Conclusions
We developed a novel method for the synthesis of 3DOM Nafion/CsHPW scaffolds as a support for Pt/C electrocatalysts for fuel cells. The results demonstrated the successful formation of a highly ordered macroporous structure with uniform and well-dispersed Cs2.5H0.5PW12O40 NPs. The new 3DOM Nafion/CsHPW scaffolds significantly increase the proton conductivity and enhance the gas transportation and diffusion within the electrode catalyst layer. This is clearly demonstrated by the significantly increased proton conductivity of the 3DOM/CsHPW catalyst layer, the reduced cell ohmic resistance and elimination of the severe concentration polarization of cells operated at high current densities. The best performance was obtained on cells with Pt/C-3DOM Nafion/CsHPW with 10% CsHPW, achieving proton conductivity of 1.56 × 10−2 S cm−1 and maximum power density of 955 mW cm−2. Owing to the feasibility to tune the structure ordering as well as the NP composition in the scaffolds, we expect that the method reported here could serve as a general approach for the systematic development of highly ordered and functionalized porous architectures for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications.
