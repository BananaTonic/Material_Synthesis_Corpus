4.Conclusions
For the first time we report the preparation of Na11Sn2PSe12 sodium electrolytes through ball milling, which should be more scalable then the previously reported synthesis in sealed ampoules. When followed by annealing for 6 h the conductivity reaches 1.0 mS cm−1 and thus nearly the same values as achieved recently by the (less scalable) synthesis in vacuum-sealed quartz ampules.
Using the fast-ion conducting mechanochemically synthesized NSPSe we demonstrated the first room temperature all-solid state Na–Se battery. As seen from Fig. 14 its capacity, rate capability and cycle-life exceed the ones of previously reported insertion-type solid state batteries based on NSPSe or NSPS. In the absence of a previously reported all-solid state Na–Se batteries, we also include in the comparison a recently reported liquid electrolyte Na-ion Se battery59 as well as a battery that uses the transition metal selenide Fe2CoSe4 as a conversion cathode showing that the performance of our new battery chemistry is comparable to that of related liquid electrolyte systems.
Benchmarking of specific capacity vs. cycle number achieved in this work to recent literature reports48,51 of solid state Na-based batteries using NSPS or NSPSe as its solid electrolyte as well as of other recently reported liquid electrolyte Na–Se59 and Na-metal selenide60 batteries.
