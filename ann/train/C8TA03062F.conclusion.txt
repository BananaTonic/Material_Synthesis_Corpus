4.Conclusion
In summary, novel network polymer electrolyte membranes were obtained via a ring-opening polymerization technique. The polymer electrolyte membranes were self-standing, flexible and non-tacky and could be successfully used as separators in Li metal batteries. The ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolytes could be easily optimized by varying the GMA content in the 3-arm prepolymer, the crosslinking density or lithium salt concentration. The electrolyte possessed a high electrochemical stability window of 4.5 V and had good stability to suppress Li dendrite growth in lithium metal batteries. Lithium metal batteries assembled using the polymer electrolyte as the separator and LiFePO4 as the cathode exhibited a high capacity of 156.2 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.1C at 60 °C and long cycling stability. It also exhibited excellent rate capability up to 3C. Therefore, the excellent electrochemical properties of the interpenetrating network polymer electrolyte make it an alternative promising electrolyte for solid-state lithium-based batteries.
