Conclusions
Herein, NPGOM-CNF solid electrolytes with long-range 1D/2D ionic nanochannels are successfully prepared based on 2D functionalized GO and 1D CNF nanomaterials. Functionalized GO nanocomposites are prepared by loading PFSA nanorods on PGO nanosheets utilizing the H-bonding interaction as well as the amphiphilic nature of PFSA and PGO. The NPGOM-CNF membranes are prepared via filtering the mixed dispersion of NPGO and CNFs. CNFs were coated with PFSA during the filtration process, and the 1D/2D long-range ionic nanochannels were constructed along the surfaces of CNFs and NPGO nanocomposites. NPGOM-CNF membranes show outstanding stability in water and high proton conductivity. The proton conductivity of NPGOM-10-CNF at 100 °C and 40% RH is 0.13 S cm−1, which is four times higher than that of Nafion117. At 80 °C and 95% RH, NPGOM-10-CNF also has a high proton conductivity of 0.40 S cm−1. NPGOM-10-CNF shows superior PEMFC performances. The peak power density of the NPGOM-10-CNF-based MEA is 31% higher than that of the Nafion117-based MEA at 60 °C and 100% RH. NPGOM-10-CNF also has better hydrogen impedance ability. Besides, NPGOM-10-CNF further shows strong methanol blocking ability. The methanol permeability of NPGOM-10-CNF is two orders of magnitude lower than that of commercialized Nafion117, which indicates its promising potential in the DMFC area.
