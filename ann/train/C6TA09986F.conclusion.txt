Conclusions
We synthesized a family of novel HCPEs combining PEG of different molecular weights, OINs formed in situ, ILs, and Li triflate. It was demonstrated that the presence of an IL does not prevent cross-linking between silica nanoparticles and PEG chains, although the cross-linking density depends on the IL amount and the PEG molecular weight, with the highest degree of cross-linking at 30% of an IL for PEG300. The formation of networks, and as a consequence the presence of elastic HCPE films with a gel-like behavior, is confirmed by frequency sweeps. Despite the presence of cations and anions of an IL, the conductivity is governed by Li ions, while the ionic liquid greatly enhances the conductivity and the transference number. The highest room temperature conductivity achieved in this work for 300-IL2-55 is 1.24 × 10−3 S cm−1, i.e., among the best conductivities reported for polymer electrolytes with ionic liquids.
