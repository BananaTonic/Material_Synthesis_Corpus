2.3.Synthesis of PEG-grafted PAEK polymer (PAEK-g-PEG)
The procedure for synthesizing the PAEK-g-PEG polymer is depicted in Scheme 1(III).45 In a nitrogen atmosphere, 10 g (–COOH: 10.25 mmol) of PAEK-COOH, 30 g (30 mmol, three times the mole amount of PAEK-COOH) of MPEG, and 100 mL of anhydrous THF were added to a 250 mL three-neck flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and stirred until a homogeneous solution was formed. Next, 30 mL of an anhydrous THF solution, 2.536 g (12.3 mmol) of DCC and 0.150 g (1.23 mmol) of DMAP were added in a drop-wise manner to the solution, and the reaction was allowed to continue at 50 °C for 60 h, the white precipitate dicyclohexyl urea (DCU) was formed. The product was obtained by filtering the DCU and the solution was poured into the deionized water to precipitate, after which the grafted polymer was washed with deionized water several times to remove the unreacted PEG. Finally, the obtained product was dried in a vacuum at 50 °C for 48 h, yielding the PAEK-g-PEG polymer. Yield: 87%. Mn: 57.3 kg mol−1. The content of grafted PEG: 53 mol%.

2.4.Preparation of PAEK/PAEK-g-PEG composite micro-porous membranes
The composite micro-porous membranes were fabricated using the conventional phase-inversion technique; the process is shown in Scheme S1.15,19 The PAEK and PAEK-g-PEG polymers were dissolved in a mixture of DMAc (solvent) and glycerin (non-solvent) (10 : 1 v/v), and the mixture was stirred strongly for 24 h until a homogeneous solution formed. The resulting viscous solution was casted onto a clean glass plate. The liquid solvent (DMAc) was slowly evaporated by heating at 100 °C in an oven for 12 h. Next the polymer membrane was dipped into distilled water and ultrasound to remove the non-solvent (glycerol) and form micropores. A series of thus-fabricated wet micro-porous membranes were dried to a constant weight in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h. The weight ratio of the PAEK-g-PEG polymer in the membranes was 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%; the thickness of the composite micro-porous membrane was around 100 μm and these membranes were designated as M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4 (Table 1), respectively.

The LiClO4 gel aqueous electrolyte was prepared by dissolving the 1M LiClO4 in 1 L deionized water. Next, a measured amount of carboxylated chitosan (0 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, 2 wt% and 4 wt%) was added to this aqueous solution. To obtain the homogeneous aqueous solutions, the samples were heated at 50 °C and stirred continuously till the chitosan had dissolved completely. The MPEs were prepared by immersing the M3 micro-porous membrane in the LiClO4 gel electrolyte solutions for 1 h. The thus-fabricated MPEs were labeled as E0, E0.5, E1, E2 and E4. For comparison, the commercial separator was also soaked in the 1 M LiClO4 electrolyte in the absence of chitosan; this sample was designated as C0. The nomenclatures of the various MPE samples are listed in Table 2.

2.6.1Sample analysis
The chemical structures of the PAEK and PAEK-g-PEG polymers were confirmed through 1H NMR measurements performed with a 300 MHz Bruker 510 spectrometer while using CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded by using a Nicolet Impact 410 Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer in transmission.
2.6.2Characterization of the composite micro-porous membranes
The surface morphologies and pore structures of the micro-porous membranes were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Nova Nano SEM 450; FEI, USA), which was performed at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to assess the thermal stabilities of the composite micro-porous membranes. All the samples were tested at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 100 °C to 700 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere with Pyris 1TGA (Perkin-Elmer). The mechanical properties of the composite micro-porous membranes as well as that of the commercial separator were evaluated at room temperature at a strain rate of 2 mm min−1 on a SHIMADZU AG-I Universal Test machine.
The porosities of the membranes were measured using the following method: the dry membrane being tested was weighed (Mdry) and then immersed in ethanol for 6 h. Next, the wet membrane was wiped with a piece of filter paper to remove the residual ethanol and weighed again (Mwet). The corresponding porosity was determined using the following equation:151where P% is the porosity, ρ is the density of the ethanol and V is the apparent volume of the porous membrane.
2.6.3Characterization of the MPEs
The electrolyte uptake and the leakage rates of the membranes were measured by soaking the membrane being tested in the electrolyte at room temperature for 4 h. The wet membrane was removed and its weight (Mt) was measured after sandwiching it between two pieces of filter papers and placing a 100 g glass plate on the top filter paper. The electrolyte uptake (W%) and leakage rates (WL%) were calculated using the following equations:3723
The ionic conductivity (σ) values of the gel MPE samples were determined by alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy (electrochemical workstation model: CHI660A, Shanghai Chen Hua Co., Ltd), which was performed using a voltage amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 Hz. The impedance data were obtained by sandwiching the MPE being tested between two parallel stainless steel electrodes and heating it from 20 °C to 70 °C. The σ was calculated using the following equation:394where Rb (ohm) is the resistance of the bulk electrolyte, L (cm) is the thickness of the MPE membrane, and S (cm2) is the effective area between the MPE membrane and the steel electrodes. For each membrane sample, the average of five measurements was taken.
2.6.4Measurements of electrochemical performance of EDLCs
The electrochemical performances of the EDLCs were measured using two different electrochemical workstations (Model: CHI660A, Shanghai Chen Hua Co., Ltd and LAND, Wuhan, China). The CV curves were recorded for a stable potential window of 0–1.5 V for various scan rates (5–200 mV s−1). The EIS measurements were performed in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz and a potential amplitude of 10 mV. The GCD measurements were performed at various current densities (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1). Based on the GCD data, the specific capacitances (Cs, F g−1) of the single electrode could be calculated using the following equation:5
The energy density (Ecell, W h kg−1) and power density (Pcell, W kg−1) values were calculated as shown below:47,4867where m (g) is the total activated carbon mass of the two electrodes, I (A) is the discharge current, ΔV (V) is the potential change during the discharging process (excluding the potential drops during the initial discharging stage), and Δt is the discharge time.
