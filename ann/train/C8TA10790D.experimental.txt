Computational methodology
Total energies of high-temperature (HT) F4̄3m phases and low-temperature (LT) Pna21 phases of cation-substituted Li7PS6 (cations: B, Al, Si, Ge, and Sn) were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).14,32 The exchange and correlation energy was in the form of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).33 The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was used to depict the electron–ion interactions.34 The cutoff energy was set to 500 eV, and the Brillouin zones were sampled with a gamma-centered k point mesh of 7 × 7 × 7 for all structures. During all calculations, all degrees of freedom including cell shape and lattice constants were allowed to relax, and optimal atomic positions were obtained once the magnitude of the Hellmann–Feynman force acting on each atom is &lt;0.01 eV Å−1. In the present work, a concentration of 0.25 is adopted for all specified elements, as Li7P0.75X0.25S6 (X = Si, Ge, B, Al).
Synthesis of argyrodites
The precursor materials to synthesize Li7+(5−n)xMxn+P1−xS6 (Mn+ = Al3+, B3+, Si4+, Ge4+; 0 ≤ x &lt; 0.4) were Li2S (Sigma Aldrich, 99.98%), P2S5 (Mucklin, 99%), SiS2 (KaiYada Photoelectric Technology Co., Ltd, 99.99%), Al2S3 (Alfa Aesar, 99%), B (Sigma Aldrich, 99.9%), S (Sigma Aldrich, 99.99%), and GeS2 (KaiYada Photoelectric Technology Co., Ltd, 99.99%). Raw materials were weighed following the molar ratios in Li7+(5−n)xMxn+P1−xS6 (Mn+ = Al3+, B3+, Si4+, and Ge4+; 0 &lt; x &lt; 0.4). All precursors were mixed by hand in an agate mortar in an Ar-filled glovebox and then transferred to a ZrO2 pot with ZrO2 balls (10 mm) for ball milling. The planetary ball milling apparatus was set to 360 rpm for 18 h. The specimens were pressed into pellets at 300 MPa and then sealed in a quartz tube at ∼10 Pa using a Partulab device (MRVS-1002). Then the samples were heated at 823 K for 12 h and cooled slowly to room temperature.
Materials characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted with an X'Pert PRO diffractometer (PANalytical X'pert PRO-DY2198, Holland) with high-intensity Cu Kα1 irradiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) operated at a voltage of 40 kV and 40 mA current. The diffraction data were collected at a step size of 0.015° and a time per step of 18.01 ms in the 2θ range from 10 to 60° (step size of 0.01° and a time per step of 43.37 ms in the 2θ range from 10° to 120° for the refined samples). The samples were sealed using a Kapton film to prevent exposure to moisture. Rietveld refinements of X-ray data were carried out using GSAS software.35 The quality of least squares refinement was indicated by several residual functions: Rwp, Rexp and χ2. The P and Si (Ge) occupancies in the 4b site were constrained by setting the sum to 1. Thermal analyses were conducted in sealed resistant aluminum crucibles on a DSC Q2000 (heating and cooling rates: 10 K min−1) from 223 K to 773 K. Raman spectra were measured at room temperature to observe the local structure of Li7.25Si0.25P0.75S6 and Li7.25Ge0.25P0.75S6 using LabRAM HR800 (Horiba Jobin Yvon). A 532 nm wavelength laser was used as an excitation source.
Electrochemical characterization
The ionic conductivities were measured by an AC impedance method under an argon atmosphere with an applied voltage of 20 mV and a frequency range from 10 Hz to 10 MHz, using a Solartron 1260 frequency response analyser. Powders were pelletized into pellets (thickness = 1–2 mm, diameter = 10 mm) under 300 MPa, and covered with Au powder on each side. For calculating the activation energy, the ionic conductivities of the samples were also measured in the temperature range from 298–373 K. The electrochemical windows were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. The measurement was conducted on a cell with a Li/SE/Au configuration at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 between −0.5 and 5 V using a Solartron 1470E CellTest system. The compatibility between the solid electrolytes and Li metal was investigated using Li/SE/Li symmetric cells. The symmetric cells were cycled on a Land battery test system at a constant current density of 0.53 mA cm−1 at room temperature.
