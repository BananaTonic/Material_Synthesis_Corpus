Conclusions
In summary, we for the first time could introduce covalent organic frameworks as proton conducting solid electrolytes in fuel cells. We have prepared bipyridine functionalized covalent organic frameworks (TpBpy) using solvothermal as well as simple mechanochemical route. These COFs exhibit permanent porosity, crystallinity and strong acid–base stability. We have then loaded mineral acid viz. H3PO4 inside the framework backbones. Interestingly, these COFs retain their crystallinity and stability that made them attractive for proton conduction applications. While the parent COFs exhibit negligible conductivity, the H3PO4 loaded COFs i.e. the PA@TpBpy-ST and PA@TpBpy-MC show decent proton conductivity. Moreover, the less porous nature of PA@TpBpy-MC has been successfully leveraged to obtain a stable OCV and a solid-state electrolyte conductivity of 1.4 × 10−2 S cm−1 while the solvothermally synthesized material proves ineffective under similar conditions. Thus, for the first time we have successfully leveraged such characteristics of mechanochemically synthesized COFs to showcase their advantage over solvothermal counterparts. We believe that this demonstration will unravel further avenues for the use of mechanochemically synthesized COFs for applications involving acute conditions such as solid electrolytes in fuel cells.
