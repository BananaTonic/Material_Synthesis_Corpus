Conclusions
In summary, an advanced three-dimensional electrode with ultrathin flexible NiO mesoporous nanosheets directly grown on nickel foam was successfully synthesized through a facile chemical immersion method combined with a subsequent calcination treatment. The unique structural design could well enhance the electronic conductivity of the hybrid electrode and make full use of the active material. Without any additive/binder, the hybrid electrode demonstrates an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2504.3 F g−1 which is even close to the theoretical value of NiO. Moreover, the electrode also exhibits good rate capability and remarkable cycling stability (no degradation of the overall capacitance after 45 000 cycles). Furthermore, the fabrication strategy could be easily scaled-up and might hold some potential for applications in high-performance energy storage. In addition, the present strategy could be extended to fabricate other transition metal oxide electrodes with desirable nanostructures, like MnO2, Co3O4 (Fig. S10), and so forth.
