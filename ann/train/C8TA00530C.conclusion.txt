Conclusions
Sodium-ion cells have been assembled with a gel polymer electrolyte cured by in situ chemical cross-linking with a mixture of a novel phosphorus-based crossing-linked agent and alkyl acrylate monomers. The gel polymer electrolyte showed high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, good flame-retardant properties and excellent electrochemical performances. Moreover, the GPE cells displayed excellent long-term cycling performance compared to the liquid electrolyte system at a current density 5C, suggesting that the GPE has good liquid electrolyte retention and compatibility with electrodes. This study provides a novel type of better GPE system for sodium-ion batteries.
