Synthesised electrolyte materials
Materials with different nominal compositions were synthesised with various molar ratios of the binary materials powders of Li2S, P2S5, LiCl, and Li2Te as the reactants, through the following reactions during ball milling and subsequent thermal annealing:3Li2S + P2S5 → 2Li3PS4Li3PS4 + Li2S + LiCl → Li6PS5ClLi3PS4 + 1.25Li2S + 0.75LiCl → Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75Li3PS4 + 0.125Li2Te + 1.25Li2S + 0.75LiCl → Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75
The dried powder samples obtained after step (b) in the synthetic process were put into closed alumina crucibles for DSC analysis. The DSC traces from the Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 and Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 powders are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) respectively.

The existence of multi-endothermic peaks is indicative of the melting of different phases. The peak at the highest temperature corresponded to the liquidus of the alloys. The first exothermic valley during cooling is the solidus of the argyrodite phase, being 514 °C and 495 °C for Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 and Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 respectively. The melting temperature of each alloy is between the liquidus and solidus as evidenced in a DSC trace for a congruous substance, since the typically observed discrepancy is due to the overshooting of the transition temperatures typical for first order transformations during continuous cooling. The melting temperatures of the two alloys are therefore about 520 °C. The secondary crystallisation temperatures for the two materials are shown to be 288 °C and 290 °C. They are close to the theoretically predicted temperature for the decomposition of the argyrodite structure into binary species at the lowered temperature, as the equilibrium temperatures for both the Li6PS5Cl and the Te substituted S compound were predicted to be around 340 °C.4 The slightly lower temperatures in the DSC traces can be attributed to overshooting during cooling. On the basis of the thermodynamic modelling,4 the argyrodite phase structure is stable between the melting and the highest crystallisation temperature in the cooling DSC trace. Such DSC feedback was therefore combined with the theoretical outcome to optimise the process for the synthesis of the materials, as is summarised in the experimental section.
Fig. 3 shows the typical SEM morphologies at the different stages of the synthetic process, using the Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloy as an example. The particulate features of the powder after the process step (b) are exhibited in Fig. 3(a), which could be compressed into relatively dense pellets as shown in Fig. 3(b). The sample after the four steps of the synthetic process is shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d), with the latter taken at a higher magnification to reveal the typical fractogram of a crystalline argyrodite grain.

The XRD patterns of the three alloys are presented in Fig. 4(a), and are consistent with the calculated pattern using the lattice parameters from the theoretical work.4 Apparently, all three alloys only showed peaks from the argyrodite phase with F43̄m (216) symmetry. The overall features of the diffractograms are also consistent with the experimentally observed patterns of Li6PS5X with an argyrodite structure (CIF no. 418490).23,24 The XRD pattern of the Li6PS5Cl alloy from this work is completely consistent with the calculated pattern. A closer look at the patterns, as shown in Fig. 4(b), reveal some peak shift towards lower diffraction angles due to the off-stoichiometry from Li6PS5Cl. The 2θ values for peaks are in the sequence Li6PS5Cl &gt; Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 &gt; Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75, indicating lattice expansion in the order of Li6PS5Cl (9.859) &lt; Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 (9.878) &lt; Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 (9.916). This is attributed to a weakened electrostatic interaction between the bivalent chalcogen anions and Li+ cations, leading to longer bonds between them.4 As the binding in these argyrodite chalcognides is mainly from the bonds in the octahedral Li6S or Li6Te, the enlarged bond length is expected to induce lattice softening, as was observed by Kraft et al. in Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) using different halogen species.26 The weaker bonding in the softer lattice corresponds to a decreased activation barrier Ea (easier ionic transport), and lowered phonon band frequencies.27,40,41

The binding in the octahedra consists of one chalcogen and six Li ions and dictates the stability of the argyrodite phase, such that halogen species located in the interstitial sites between the tetrahedral PS4 units have a much weaker contribution to the lattice parameter.4 Consequently, the substitution of S by Te at the chalcogen sites within each octahedron is expected to have a much greater impact on the lattice softening.4 The activation barrier also strongly depends on the phonon properties, as it is directly related to the ratio of the vibrational partition functions of the excited and initial states.
The phonon bands of Li6PS5Cl and Li6PTeS4Cl were carefully compared through PHONOPY calculations based on the frozen-phonon calculations42,43 by harmonic approximation (the details for the theoretical methods were presented in our recent work4,7,41). The calculated phonon band structures for Li6PTeS4Cl and Li6PS5Cl are compared in Fig. 5. As indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 5(a) and (b), for Li6PS5Cl and Li6PTeS4Cl, the phonon bands of Li6PS5Cl are obviously higher than those of Li6PTeS4, suggesting that the Te substitution of S does lead to lattice softening.

This is indeed the case, as is evidenced by the calculated Raman spectra, using the vasp_raman.py utility tool,44 as shown in Fig. 5(c). The Raman peak for Li6PTeS4Cl is seen to be shifted to a lower frequency region with reference to that of the stoichiometric Li6PS5Cl phase, with a significant value of 10 cm−1. The experimental Raman spectra of all three alloys are compared in Fig. 5(d). The Raman peak for Li6PS5Cl is located at the highest frequency of 423 cm−1, being consistent with reported values.45,46 The peaks for the two off-stoichiometric alloys are shifted towards the lower frequency regions, with the Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloy experiencing the biggest Raman shift. A small quantity of Te substituting only 2.4% of S sites in the slightly off-stoichiometric phase induced a significant Raman left shift of 3.6 cm−1 with respect to that of the stoichiometric Li6PS5Cl phase. It is worth noting that Raman analyses did not evidence any secondary phases, consistent with the XRD results.
Impedance spectroscopy
The samples of the stoichiometric Li6PS5Cl, and the off-stoichiometric Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 and Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloys were characterized by means of impedance spectroscopy over a broad frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 6, with insets for equivalent circuits from numerical fitting using the ZView code for impedance analysis. While the impedance spectrum of the stoichiometric Li6PS5Cl material is characterised by a pseudo-semicircle in the high frequency region, joining a straight line on its right, the spectrum for the Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloy only contains a straight line. The semicircle is attributed to a parallel double-layer capacitor (or rather constant phase element) and a resistor (R1) due to the difficulty in the charge transfer through the space charge region across the double layer, and an ohmic resistor in series is characteristic of the transport limited resistance, R0. The diameter of a semicircle is a measure of the space charge associated with a double layer. The larger the semicircle, the poorer the ionic conductivity across the electrolyte layer. Therefore, the absence of a semicircle in the Nyquist diagram of impedance is attributed to the superb ionic conductivity in the electrolyte, which is characterised by R0 in series with either a constant phase element (CPE, Q),47 or as shown in this work, a Warburg element (W) typical for 1D diffusion controlled processes. It is necessary to point out that the double-layer resistance in Nyquist diagrams of solid electrolytes has often been referred to as the grain boundary resistance. One notices, however, the lack of experimental evidence to support such postulation. It is apparent from the current experimental results that grain boundaries exist in all the polycrystalline samples, but only samples with poorer ionic conductivity exhibited the double layer semicircles. Even for the same material of Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75, for example, the impedance evidence of a double layer is only present when the ionic conductivity becomes somewhat poorer at the sub-zero temperature of −20 °C (Fig. S1). Indeed, the physical principle behind a double layer is attributed to a space charge region, which only exists when charge transfer is inadequate, e.g. in a conventional capacitor. It is known that ionic conductivity arises from the diffusion of a charged species, e.g. lithium ions. It has been established with sound evidence that the activation energy for grain boundary diffusion is only about 40% to 60% of that for bulk diffusion within a crystalline phase, due to the existence of numerous broken bonds.48,49 Therefore, there is no physical basis for the existence of a significant “grain boundary” resistance in solid electrolytes, unless galvanised boundary layers are present. It is therefore appropriate to use the terminology of either double layer resistance or charge transfer resistance in this work.
Room temperature (25 °C) impedance spectroscopy over a broad frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz for the synthesized materials: (a) Li6PS5Cl, (b) Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75, and (c) Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75. The insets show equivalent circuits from numerical fitting. (d) The temperature dependence of impedance for the Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloy, from 25 to 120 °C. Details corresponding to model parameters in the simulated circuits are summarised in Table S1 in the ESI.
The Nyquist diagram for the slightly off-stoichiometric Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 alloy exhibits features between those of the above two alloys. The ohmic resistance is significantly smaller, and the semicircle is much smaller than that of the stoichiometric material. The overall/total ionic resistance of an electrolyte, neglecting that from the metallic contact, is made-up of the ohmic resistance of the bulk material and the charge transfer, or double-layer, resistance(s). Being consistent with the theoretical modelling, both off-stoichiometry and Te substitution of S were able to promote the ionic conductivity of Li+, so that the total resistance for the three alloys ranks as Li6PS5Cl (266.2 Ω), Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 (72.5 Ω), and Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 (16.56 Ω).
The ionic conductivities can be derived from the total resistance Rtotal, the thickness of the electrolyte (d) between the parallel silver-coated contact plates with area A (where d ≪ A to satisfy the 1D transport condition):501
The ionic conductivity for Li6PS5Cl was 0.28 mS cm−1 at 25 °C, apparently below the 1 mS cm−1 marker value to the rival liquid electrolyte. Slight off-stoichiometric compositional drift, i.e. Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75, led to an increased ionic conductivity of nearly four times, to about 1.03 mS cm−1 at 25 °C, being equivalent to the best reported data based on Li6PS5Cl at a higher temperature of 40 °C.24 In the case of Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75, with both Te substituting S and off-stoichiometry, the ionic conductivity was increased to as high as 4.5 mS cm−1 at 25 °C, more than four times that of Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75. The joint effect through off-stoichiometry and S substitution with Te led to the remarkable enhancement of ionic conductivity, up to 16 times of that for the stoichiometric material Li6PS5Cl. It is worth mentioning that the ionic conductivity of 4.5 mS cm−1 from this work is significantly higher than reported data from this electrolyte family.24,25 Even at the lower temperatures of 0 and −20 °C (Fig. S1), the Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloy still maintained a fairly high ionic conductivity of over 2.45 and 1.6 mS cm−1 respectively, which is indeed remarkable for a solid electrolyte.
Temperature dependence of ionic conductivity
The impedance spectroscopy measurements were also carried out at different temperatures, ranging from 25 to 120 °C. The data for the Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloy is summarised in Fig. 6(d), showing that the straight line due to CPE is left shifted with increasing temperature. Details for Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 and Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 are presented in Table S2. For Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75, the total resistance reduced from 72.5 Ω to 30 Ω from 25 to 120 °C, with the corresponding ionic conductivity increasing from 1.03 to 2.99 mS cm−1. For Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75, the ionic conductivity increased from 4.5 mS cm−1 at 25 °C to 18.0 mS cm−1 at 120 °C.
The ionic conductivity σ is related to the diffusion coefficient from the Nernst–Einstein equation,402where ρ is the molar density of diffusing alkali ions in the unit cell, z is the charge of alkali ions (+1 for Li+), F and R is the Faraday constant and the gas constant, respectively, D0 is a constant, Ea is the activation energy for diffusion, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and . It follows that the activation energy for conductivity is exactly the same as that for diffusion, which can be readily derived through plotting the following logarithmic relationship:with Ea being related to the slope of the line, B, as Ea = 0.198 × B. Ionic conductivity data from this experimental investigation are presented in Fig. 7. These data are compared to the benchmarked conductivity data derived from the theoretically simulated diffusion coefficients,4 using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD),28,51 for Li6PS5Cl and Li6.25PTeS4.25Cl0.75.
Arrhenius relationship of ionic conductivity being presented as log(σT) vs.. AIMD simulated results for Li6PTeS4Cl (red line), and Li6PS5Cl (black line) are shown against the experimental data from Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 (blue) and Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 (green). Being consistent with AIMD simulation results, remarkable enhancement of ionic conductivity is apparent both by excess Li and, more effectively, by the Te substitution of S.
The theoretically derived ionic conductivity of the stoichiometric Li6PS5Cl compound lies at the bottom of Fig. 7, with the steepest slope corresponding to the highest activation barrier of 0.52 eV for Li+ transport. On the other hand, the AIMD predicted Li+ conductivity for Li6.25PTeS4.25Cl0.75 is remarkably higher than that of the stoichiometric phase, together with a much lowered activation barrier of 0.168 eV. This is shown in Fig. 7 as the top red line, demonstrating the combined effect of moderate off-stoichiometric compositional shift and the Te substitution of S. Considering that the theoretical modelling work was carried out using perfect single crystals, the agreement between theory and experiments is surprisingly excellent, since the real materials were made of poly-crystals with a considerable amount of porosity. The actual ionic conductivity in denser materials would be considerably higher.
The experimental data from the two alloys prepared in this work also follow straight lines, between the above two theoretically predicted marker lines, suggesting that ionic transport did follow the Arrhenius law against temperature. The slight off-stoichiometric drift in the Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 alloy resulted in significantly enhanced Li+ conductivity and a remarkably lower activation barrier of 0.148 eV. In addition, Te replacement of only 2.4% of S, namely in Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75, led to an even greater boost for Li+ conductivity, and the activation energy of 0.16 eV is in excellent agreement with the AIMD predicted Te effect. The remarkably enlarged prefactor A in eqn (2) and the lowered activation barrier for the Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloy enabled an excellent ionic conductivity of 2.56 mS cm−1 at 0 °C and 1.612 mS cm−1 at −20 °C, still higher than the benchmark value of 1 mS cm−1 for liquid organic electrolytes.
The probability density distribution of Li+ ions from the AIMD simulations at the temperature of 1000 K are indicative of the ionic transport performance for Li6PS5Cl, Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75, and Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloys, Fig. 8. It is apparent that the Li+ trajectories are rather localized on the octahedral Li6S units in Li6PS5Cl, so that there would be rather a limited chance for long-distance diffusion at such a temperature. This is consistent with the rather poor ionic conductivity for this stoichiometric material.24 The off-stoichiometric composition with Li+ excess in Li6.25PS5.25Cl0.75 leads to inter-octahedral overlapping in the Li+ trajectory, and extensive trajectory overlapping is enabled in Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 due to both Li+ excess and Te substitution of S. The transport of Li+ ions is thus determined by inter-octahedral diffusion, which is largely dependent upon the interaction with anions in the compound, so that both substitution of S by other chalcogen elements with lower electronegativity, and off-stoichiometry with excess Li+, helps to promote the transport of alkali ions.4

In order to evaluate the electrochemical stability of the current electrolytes with metallic anodes, we carried out voltammetry and cycling stability tests using Li/Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75/stainless-steel half cells and Li/Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75/Li symmetric cells respectively. The voltammetry trace shown in Fig. 9 shows typical redox peaks owing to the plating and the stripping of Li during the charging–discharging cycle. The corresponding coulombic efficiencies for the first, second and third cycle are 87.3%, 90.4%, 89.8% respectively. The absence of any other peaks in the entire voltage range up to 7 V indicates that the best solid-state electrolyte from this work is reasonably stable over a wide voltage range versus metallic Li, evidently better than the corresponding performance of the LGPS system (cf. Fig. 1b in ref. 6).6
Cyclic voltammetry of a stainless-steel/Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75/Li cell over three charging–discharging cycles (scan rate 0.5 mV s−1).
Furthermore, the cycle stability test using the symmetric Li/Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75/Li cell was carried out by applying a constant current density of 20 μA cm−2 under alternating polarity, as shown in Fig. 10(a). There is little change of voltage over a prolonged period of 100 h. Similar behaviour was observed at a higher current of 0.1 mA cm−2 in Fig. 10(b). This is consistent with the voltammetry result, which indicates limited solid phase transition at the anode electrolyte interface.
Galvanostatic cycling of Li/Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75/Li at a current density of (a) 20 μA cm−2 and (b) 0.2 mA cm−2.
Furthermore, the Li6.25PTe0.125S5.125Cl0.75 alloy was used to fabricate full test cells, using the well-established LiFePO4 as a cathode (LiFePO4 loading: 4.5 mg cm−2) and Li as an anode. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI, a clean and well-defined voltage plateau was evidenced together with typical cathode capacity. This is further evidence of the great promise in enabling advanced solid-state lithium ion batteries with high capacity. It is worth pointing out that the coulombic efficiency of the full cell is not very good, which is likely to be attributable to issues related to the cathode/electrolyte interface. Work is under way to optimise the engineering processes, focusing on interfacial modification and cathode additives etc., which are well recognised technical means for the development of full cells.
