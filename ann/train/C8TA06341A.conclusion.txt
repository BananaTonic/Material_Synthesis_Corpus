4Conclusions
In summary, an epoxy resin–ceramic composite electrolyte with a three-tier structure has been designed and prepared successfully using the settling effect of LLTO nanoparticles in the curing process of the epoxy resin. The unique three-tier structure not only avoids the side effects of LLTO perfectly, but also decreases the interfacial resistance due to the good contact between the flexible epoxy-rich layer and the electrodes. When the weight percent of LLTO is 10%, the obtained electrolyte exhibits a high room temperature ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical stability window and high Li-ion transference number. In addition, the epoxy matrix electrolytes can effectively inhibit the growth of Li dendrites even at a high current density of 4 mA cm−2, which is due to the unique mesoporous structure of the epoxy resin and the fast ion transport channels provided by LLTO, promoting the uniform deposition of Li-ions. Moreover, the Li metal battery with c-EME-10% offered a high capacity retention of up to 98.6% after 100 cycles at 0.2C, and its coulombic efficiency can reach 99.9%. We believe that this multilayer structure organic–inorganic composite electrolyte will facilitate the practical application of LMBs.
