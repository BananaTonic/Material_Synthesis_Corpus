Conclusions
PEEK-PEMs with IECs in the range of 1.73–3.08 mmol g−1 showed higher conductivities of 0.001–0.009 S cm−1 even under low RH conditions (30% RH). This is because the proton conductivities of PEEK-PEMs are less dependent on RH compared with other aromatic hydrocarbon-type PEMs. Therefore, the PEEK-PEMs with an IEC of 3.08 mmol g−1 exhibited a similar conductivity to that of Nafion 212 (0.009 S cm−1) even at 30% RH probably because of its 17% water uptake, which is higher than that of Nafion 212 (WU 4.3%).
Under humid conditions, which test flooding in fuel cells, the PEEK-PEM has 1.4 times higher tensile strength (14 MPa) than Nafion 212. This is because the hydrophobic PEEK matrix prevents severe swelling, which originates from the high tensile strength of pristine PEEK films, thus helping maintain high TS because of less damage to the PEEK substrates.
The MEA fabricated using the PEEK-PEM with an IEC of 2.45 mmol g−1 showed Emax values of 860 and 826 mW cm−2 under 100% and 30% RH, respectively. This implies that the Emax of the PEEK-PEM showed low RH dependence, resulting in 2.5 times higher Emax than that of Nafion 212 at 30% RH.
X-ray scattering analyses revealed that the crystallinity of approximately 28–32% was maintained and propagated during graft polymerization of the graft-type PEEK-PEMs. The abovementioned unique structures were the origins of higher conductivity and tensile strengths, respectively, compared with conventional PEMs. Accordingly, PEEK-based graft-type PEMs should have great potential as alternative PEMs for Nafion.
