Ultrathin mesoporous NiO nanosheet-anchored 3D nickel foam as an advanced electrode for supercapacitorsElectronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c5ta05313g
As promising electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitors, pseudocapacitive transition metal oxides such as NiO possess high theoretical specific capacitance, environmental benignity and good abundance. However their areal capacitance and cycling stability are greatly restricted by their poor electronic conductivity (NiO, 10−2 to 10−3 S cm−1). Here we propose an in situ growth strategy in combination with nanoscale design to construct ultrathin mesoporous NiO nanosheets on a 3D network of nickel foam. The hybrid structures show well enhanced conductivity and ion transfer, giving rise to an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2504.3 F g−1 which is close to the theoretical value of NiO. The electrodes also exhibit remarkable cycling stability (no degradation of the overall capacitance after 45 000 cycles). The amazing electrochemical performance of such hybrid structures makes them potential electrodes in supercapacitors. The present strategy could be popularized in other transition metal oxides like Co3O4, MnO2, etc. to create electrodes with desirable nanostructures.
