Conclusions
We have demonstrated a new synthetic route for supramolecular ionic networks based on highly delocalized di-anions. In particular, supramolecular ionic networks containing hydrophobic (trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide groups showed improved water stability and higher thermal stability than the previously synthesized carboxylate ones. Although most of the synthesized compounds were semi-crystalline, amorphous networks were also obtained using aromatic asymmetric dianions. In this case, the rheological measurements in temperature sweep tests at a constant frequency confirmed a reversible network to liquid transition behavior associated with self-healing properties. Amorphous ionic networks showed high ionic conductivity, showing values close to 10−3 S cm−1 (at 100 °C). i-Nets reported here combine properties such as ionic conductivity and self-healing properties. This combination can be very interesting for applications like batteries for electric vehicles, where the security of the battery is a must, and further optimization of the ionic conductivity of our materials could lead to an electrolyte for a battery that repairs itself.
