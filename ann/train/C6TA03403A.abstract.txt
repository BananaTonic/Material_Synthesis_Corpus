Influence of Sb-substitution on ionic transport in lanthanum orthoniobatesElectronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c6ta03403a
The results of ionic transport measurements for the lanthanum orthoniobate substituted with 10 and 30 mol% of antimony (LaNb0.9Sb0.1O4 and LaNb0.7Sb0.3O4) are presented and discussed. The influence of calcium co-doping on these properties has also been analysed. It has been shown that for the investigated material protonic conductivity predominates at temperatures up to 800 °C in oxidizing atmospheres under wet conditions. The maximum observed protonic conductivity reaches ∼10−4 S cm−1 at 800 °C (in humidified air); under dry conditions, the increasing influence of oxygen vacancies and holes is detected. Oxygen self-diffusivity has also been analysed by isotopic exchange to investigate the possible diffusion paths.
