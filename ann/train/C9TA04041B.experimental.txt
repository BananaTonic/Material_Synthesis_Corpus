Experimental
Starting materials
Iron(iii) nitrate nonahydrate, PVP and CA were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Urea was obtained from Taishan Yueqiao Reagent Plastic Co. Ltd. Absolute ethanol was obtained from Tianjin Zhiyuan Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. All reagents were AR grade purity.
Synthesis process
PVP (0.2 g), CA with desired amounts (0.4 g, 0.8 g, 1.0 g, 1.2 g, and 1.6 g) and urea with desired amounts (0 g and 0.3 g) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of absolute ethanol (70 mL) and deionized water (50 mL) under stirring for 10 min to form a solution. Then iron(iii) nitrate nonahydrate (2.65 g) was added to the above solution and stirred for another 10 min. The solution was then transferred to an ultrasonic nebulizer to generate mist containing droplets of the solution, which were carried into a tube furnace with a temperature of 500 °C by Ar gas flow (1.5 L min−1). The products were collected at the far end of the tube, and further calcined at 500 °C for 2 h under Ar gas flow.
The aerosol-pyrolysis obtained products with a CA content of 1.6 g were dissolved in 5 mol L−1 HF solutions and manually agitated for 0.5 h, followed by sonication for 2 h. The products were washed using deionized water and absolute ethanol repeatedly and then dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 10 h. Finally carbon hollow spheres were obtained.
The aerosol-pyrolysis obtained products with a CA content of 1.6 g were heated at 500 °C for 4 h in air. Then porous α-Fe2O3 hollow cages were obtained.
The aerosol-pyrolysis obtained products with a CA content of 1.6 g were calcined at 700 °C for 2 h under protection of Ar gas flow. Graphitized carbon/Fe hollow spheres were obtained, which were further mixed with 1.2 mol L−1 HCl solution and agitated for 2 h. Graphitized carbon hollow spheres were obtained after washing repeatedly using deionized water and absolute ethanol and drying in a vacuum at 60 °C for 10 h.
The obtained graphitized carbon/Fe hollow spheres were put into deionized water and heated at 80 °C for 48 h in a water bath. Then graphitized carbon/α-Fe2O3 hollow spheres were synthesized after drying in a vacuum at 60 °C for 10 h.
Materials characterization
The microstructures of the products were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8), a field-emission scanning electron microscope (S-4800) and a spherical aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope (Titan G2 60-300) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). TG and DTA were performed on a TG-DTA7300 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature to 800 °C. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured on a Tristar II 3020 at 77 K. The surface area was calculated by means of the BET method. The pore sizes were calculated by means of density functional theory (DFT). XPS was carried out on an ESCALAB 250Xi. Electrical conductivity measurements were performed on an SX1934 (SZ-82) four-probe setup after the samples were compressed into cylinders with a diameter of 10 mm and length of 1 mm under a compress pressure of 50 MPa.
Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements were performed using 2016 coin-type cells with metallic lithium foil as the counter electrode. The working electrodes were prepared with active materials, acetylene black and PVDF binder at a weight ratio of 7 : 2 :1 in N-methyl-2 pyrrolidinone (NMP). The obtained slurry was coated onto Cu foil and dried at 80 °C for 24 h under vacuum. The dried tape was then punched into round plates with a diameter of 1.4 cm and used as the working electrodes. The loading densities of hollow-structured and solid-structured active materials were ∼1 and ∼1.8 mg cm−2, respectively. A Celgard 2400 membrane was used as the separator. The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethyl carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC) with a volume ratio of 1 : 1 : 1. The whole assembly process of the cells was conducted in an argon-filled glove box with moisture and oxygen contents below 0.1 ppm. Galvanostatic discharge/charge cycles were measured on a battery tester (LAND CT 2001A) in the voltage window of 0.01–3.0 V vs. Li/Li+. CV curves were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E) at a scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed on the same workstation by applying a sine wave with an amplitude of 5.0 mV over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.01 Hz.
