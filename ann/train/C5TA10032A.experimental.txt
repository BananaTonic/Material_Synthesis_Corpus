2.1.Preparation of the MoO3 solution
The MoO3 solution was prepared by dissolving ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Aldrich, 99.98%, 0.1 g) in 100 ml of deionized water.
2.2.Fabrication of PTB7:PCBM organic solar cells
Glass coated with ITO (150 nm thick, ∼10 Ω sq−1) was used as the starting substrate. It was treated using UV-ozone for 15 min followed by coating with the MoO3 solution at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The resulting MoO3 thin-film was irradiated at laser energies of 120, 240, 400 or 600 mJ cm−2, using a KrF excimer laser (λ = 248 nm, frequency = 2 Hz, size = 0.25 cm2). To fabricate the control device, a PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, then dried at 120 °C for 10 min. After samples were coated with the HTL, they were transferred to an N2-filled glove box (&lt;0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). PTB7 (purchased from 1-materials) was dissolved in chlorobenzene to make a 10 mg ml−1 solution, then blended with PC70BM (2 : 3 w : w). The blend was spin-coated (1600 rpm, 30 s) on top of the HTL. The thickness of the active layer was 80 nm as measured using an Alpha step 500 surface profiler. The cathode consisted of BCP (15 nm) coated with Ag (120 nm), which was deposited using a thermal evaporation method at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr.
2.3.Fabrication of flexible top-illuminated organic solar cells
Reflective Ag (120 nm) and ITO (20 nm) were deposited on the PES film by radio-frequency sputtering under a base pressure of 1 × 10−6 Torr. The films were treated with UV-ozone for 10 min, then coated with MoO3 solution. The resulting MoO3 layer was exposed to the laser with an energy of 240 mJ cm−2. After the HTL was applied, the active layer of PTB7:PCBM was coated by spin coating. The devices were dried on a hot plate in a glove box at 80 °C for 10 min. The transparent cathode (BCP (15 nm)/Ag (12 nm)/MoO3 (40 nm)) was deposited using thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr.
2.4.Optical simulation
The finite-domain time-difference (FDTD) simulation (fullwave) was performed for numerical analysis of the light absorption and field distribution in the polymer solar cells. The side-wall of the photo-detector was composed of a perfect mirror and the grid size was fixed to 2 nm.
2.5.Characterization
The MoO3 solution was spin-coated on the silicon substrate, followed by measuring of the thickness using a spectroscopic ellipsometer. The measured data was fitted using the Lorentz function, thereby resulting in a thickness of 3 nm. The FT-IR spectra were measured using a Bruker IFS 66v FT-IR spectrometer. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were conducted on the 4D beam line at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory with a base pressure of 5 × 10−10 Torr. AFM images were obtained in tapping mode on a Veeco Nanoscope III. An ITO (150 nm)/HyMoO3−x/Ag (120 nm) structure was fabricated for the measurement of electrical conductivity of HyMoO3−x. The conductivity was averaged over 40 samples for each of the treatment conditions. The J–V curves were measured under air ambient using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. The photocurrent was measured under AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2 illumination from an Oriel 150 W solar simulator. The light intensity was determined using a mono-silicon detector calibrated by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) was measured using a QEX10 Solar Cell Quantum Efficiency Measurement System (PV Measurements, Inc.). The integral of the IPCE curve measured under air mass 1.5 of the solar irradiance spectrum is a little smaller than the measured Jsc because the IPCE measurement cannot measure the wavelength below 400 nm.
