4.Conclusion
In conclusion, we report an innovative strategy to synthesize bulk-type full ASSLiBs by using an ionic conductive binder PAALi for the bonding of the cathode/anode layer and the interface between the electrode and solid electrolyte. The structural studies, viscosity studies, TGA-DSC, FTIR, and XRD were used to systematically evaluate the physical, chemical, and electrical properties of this binder. The Li salt binder could work and maintain its solid state below 380 °C. The interface between the binder and LAGP was stable under galvanic cycling at temperatures from −25 °C to 75 °C, and its resistance decreased more than 70 times after the galvanic cycle. The full cells were manufactured in air with excellent bonding and maintained their solid state even after being heated to 200 °C. A high total ionic conductivity of 1.03 × 10−4 S cm−1 was obtained for this cell. The discharge specific capacity of 87.5 mA h g−1 and 146 mA h g−1 was obtained at room temperature and 50 °C, respectively, which is one of the highest values to the best of our knowledge. This new concept provides an opportunity for the fabrication of large-scale ASSLiB in ambient conditions. Without sintering, this methodology largely simplifies the synthetic process and avoids the interface diffusion and reaction. Moreover, this new synthetic concept for lithium ion solid-state battery can also be extended to other ionic solid-state batteries such as Na+, K+, Al3+, and Mg2+.
