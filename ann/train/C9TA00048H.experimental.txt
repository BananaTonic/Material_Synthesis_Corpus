Preparation of NZSPx and NVP powders
NZSPx (x = 0–0.6) powders can be prepared on a laboratory scale (10 g–1 kg) using a solution-assisted solid-state reaction method (SA-SSR).19–21 NaNO3 (VWR, 99.7%), ZrO(NO3)2 (Aldrich, 99%), Si(OCH2CH3)4 (Merck, 99%) and NH4H2PO4 (Merck, 99%) were used as starting materials. Corresponding amounts of NaNO3, and ZrO(NO3)2 were dissolved into deionized water. A stoichiometric amount of Si(OCH2CH3)4 was also added to the solution while stirring. When Si(OCH2CH3)4 was hydrolyzed, the corresponding amount of NH4H2PO4 was added to the system while also stirring. The homogeneous aqueous system then changed to a mixture of a colloidal sol and precipitates of complex zirconium oxyphosphate compounds.
The whole mixture was dried at 85 °C. The dried powder was calcined at 800 °C for 3 h. After calcination, a white powder was obtained. The calcined powder was then milled in ethanol with zirconia balls on a milling bench for 48 h, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h.
NVP powders were prepared by using the Pechini's method.47 NaH2PO4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) and NH4VO3 (Merck, 99%) were applied as starting materials. Corresponding amounts of NaH2PO4 and NH4VO3 were dissolved into deionized water. Double the amount of moles (sum of NaH2PO4 and NH4VO3) of citric acid was also dissolved into the same solution, before subsequently adding the same amount of ethylene glycol. The solution was dried at 200 °C while stirring, and calcined at 400 °C for 5 h. The calcined powder was then milled in ethanol with zirconia balls on a milling bench for 24 h, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h. The NVP powder has a rhombohedral structure after reduction at 750 °C for 8 h in Ar containing 2% H2, with 10 wt% of carbon remaining in the powder, which comes from the incomplete combustion of citric acid and ethylene glycol. The carbon content was determined by heating the powder at 650 °C in air, where carbon was burnt out, while NVP was also decomposed because of its instability in air at high temperature. The decomposed NVP was then heated up at 750 °C in Ar containing 2% H2 again. Pure phase NVP was obtained again. The weight difference of the final achieved powder and the original powder is regarded as the carbon content.
Fabrication of specimens and single cells
For conductivity testing, the milled NZSPx powders were put into a cylindrical pressing mold with a diameter of 8–13 mm and pressed with a uniaxial pressure of 100 MPa at room temperature. The pressed pellets were then sintered at 1250 °C–1300 °C for 5 h. The pellets had obtained a diameter of 6.5–10.5 mm and thickness of about 1 mm. For the preparation of electrolytes of the single cells, the procedure is just like above, but specifically only with NZSP0.4 powder, using a cylindrical pressing mold with a diameter of 13 mm and sintered at 1260 °C for 5 h. The pellets obtained had a diameter of about 10 mm and thickness of about 1 mm.
Some of the milled NZSP0.4 powder was sintered at 1260 °C for 5 h, then ground and ball-milled again on a milling bench for 48 h. The sintered NZSP0.4 powder obtained was mixed with the milled NVP powder with a NZSP0.4 : NVP (with carbon) = 40 : 60, i.e. NZSP0.4 : NVP : C weight ratio of 40 : 54 : 6. The mixed powder was then screen-printed on both sides of the sintered NZSP0.4 pellets as negative and positive electrodes, followed by co-sintering at 750 °C for 8 h in Ar containing 2% H2. The single cells subsequently had a positive electrode weight of 0.1–1 mg. The weight of the negative electrode was adjusted to reach about 210% of the positive electrodes. The prepared single cells were then sealed inside aluminum pouch-bags, with Ni-metal pellets 12 mm in diameter as the current-collector for both anode and cathode sides.
Characterization
The XRD patterns of the sintered samples of NZSPx and/or NVP were recorded using a Bruker D4 ENDEAVOR diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation in the temperature range of 25–1200 °C. The lattice parameters and the quantitative phase analysis of the samples were determined by the Pawley and Rietveld refinement method using the TOPAS program (Bruker AXS GmbH). The microstructure of the powders or sintered samples was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope Zeiss Ultra55.
The prepared dense pellets of NSZSPx (x = 0–0.6) were sputtered with gold on both sides. The impedance spectra of the samples were measured at 25 °C using two commercial electrochemical systems (Keysight E4991B and Biologic VMP-300), with an AC frequency range from 3 GHz to 1 MHz and from 3 MHz to 1 Hz, respectively. The results were adjusted according to the dimension of the samples by multiplying with the conducting area and dividing with the thickness of the samples and fitted using software “Z-view” (Scribner Associates Inc.). The temperature was controlled using a climate chamber (Vötsch, VT4002). The temperature-dependent impedance of the NZSPx sample was measured between −100 °C and 90 °C using another commercial electrochemical system (Novocontrol Alpha-A, with normal frequency range of 10 MHz–0.01 Hz) including a temperature-controlling system, a liquid-nitrogen contained cooling system and a furnace.
The charge–discharge behavior of the all ceramic single cells was tested using an electrochemical system (Biologic VMP-300) with controlled temperature in a climate chamber (Vötsch, VT4002). A uniaxial pressure of about 100 MPa was applied during testing, while the samples were sealed in the pouch-bags and clipped between the two Ni-metal current collectors. The microstructure of the cells was analyzed by SEM (ZEISS Merlin) together with an Ar-cross-section polisher (JEOL, SM-09010). The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments were performed on an FEI Titan 80–200 Chemi-STEM equipped with a Super-X energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector system.
