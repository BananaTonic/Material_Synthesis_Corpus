Experimental
Materials
Poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO, Mn = 20 000), 4-vinylbenzyl chloride (VBC, 90%), styrene (≥99%), 2,2′-azobis-isobutyronitrile (AIBN, 98%), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, 99%), 1,4-diethynylbenzene (DEB, 96%), tetramethyl-ammonium hydroxide solution (NMe4OH, 25 wt% in H2O) and trimethylamine aqueous solution (TMA, 30 wt% in H2O) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. VBC and styrene were purified by passing them through a column filled with aluminum oxide to remove the inhibitor, and stored in a refrigerator prior to use. AIBN was recrystallized from methanol three times. Other reagents were used as received unless stated otherwise. The azide-functionalized PPO (PPO-N3) copolymer with a degree of functionalization of 60% (DF = 60%) was synthesized according to our previous report.29
Synthesis of the chloromethylated polystyrene (CM-PS) copolymer
The CM-PS copolymer was synthesized by traditional free radical polymerization using AIBN as an initiator.30 Typically, a mixture of VBC (5.0 mL, 35.6 mmol), styrene (9.5 mL, 83.1 mmol), AIBN (0.19 g, 1.2 mmol), and toluene (10 mL) was added to a Schlenk tube. After degassing with three freeze–pump–thaw cycles, the tube was sealed under argon and placed in an oil bath and heated at 65 °C for 7.5 h. Then the mixture was precipitated into excess methanol to yield a white solid. The white product was obtained by filtration, reprecipitating into methanol two more times and drying under vacuum 50 °C overnight with a yield of 65%.
Fabrication of semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) AEMs
The azide-functionalized PPO (PPO-N3, DF = 60%, 75 mg, 0.32 mmol of azide groups) and CM-PS (155 mg, 0.40 mmol of chloride) were dissolved in THF (10 wt%), and stoichiometric DEB (20 mg, 0.16 mmol) was added. The mixture (WCM-PS/WPPO-N3 = 62/30) was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and then cast onto a clean flat glass plate. After being dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight, the membrane was subsequently immersed into NMe4OH aqueous solution at 70 °C for 24 h, and TMA solution at 40 °C for 48 h to give semi-IPN AEMs (denoted as sIPN-62/30). sIPN-43/45 (WCM-PS/WPPO-N3 = 43/45) and sIPN-75/20 (WCM-PS/WPPO-N3 = 75/20) were also fabricated following the same procedures. The control membrane (n-62/30) was prepared by the blending of PPO-N3 and CM-PS copolymers with a weight ratio of 62/30, and quaternization with trimethylamine. The resulting AEMs in hydroxide or bicarbonate form were obtained by immersing the membrane in 1 M NaOH or 1 M NaHCO3 for 48 h at room temperature respectively, and then washing with deionized water to remove the residual NaOH or NaHCO3. The AEMs were stored in deionized water that was degassed and blanketed with argon prior to analysis.
Characterization and measurements
1H NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker DPX-400 instrument at room temperature using CDCl3 as the solvent. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed on a PE-1710 spectrometer from 4000 to 600 cm−1 with 4 cm−1 resolution in 64 scans using polymer thin films. The molecular weight of the CM-PS copolymer was determined by GPC (Waters 2410) using THF as the solvent with a flow rate of 0.6 mL min−1 at 35 °C. The calibration was conducted with polystyrene standards. The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) curve of the dry membrane was obtained using a SAXSess mc2 instrument (Anton Paar, Austria), equipped with a Cu-Kα slit-collimated X-ray source operating at 40 kV and 50 mA. The mechanical properties of the AEMs were measured using a dynamic mechanical analyser (TA instruments, DMAQ800) at room temperature in controlled force mode with a stretch rate of 0.5 N min−1.
The gel fractions were measured to assess the degree of crosslinking in the semi-IPN AEMs, according to our previous report.31 The semi-IPN membranes after the organic base treatment were extracted in THF at 80 °C for 24 h, followed by drying the membrane under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. The gel fraction was calculated as follows:where Wi and Wd refer to the weight of dry AEMs before and after extraction in THF.
The theoretical ion exchange capacity (IEC) values of semi-IPN membranes were calculated according to the following equation:where n(QA) is the molar content of –CH2–Cl groups in CM-PS copolymers, based on the hypothesis that complete quaternization of benzyl chloride groups with trimethylamine was realized at 40 °C for 48 h; m is the total weight of dry membranes.
The titrated gravimetric IEC values of semi-IPN membranes were measured by the Mohr method. The membranes in chloride form were equilibrated in 1 M Na2SO4 for 48 h. The released chloride ions were determined by a titration of 0.01 M AgNO3 aqueous solution with K2CrO4 as the indicator. The titrated IEC was calculated as follows:where m(dry) and VAgNO3 are the weight of the dried membrane and volume of consumed AgNO3 aqueous solution, respectively.
Water uptake (WU) of the semi-IPN AEMs in hydroxide form was calculated based on the following equation. The dry AEM weight (Wdry) was determined by drying the membrane at 60 °C for 24 h under vacuum. And then the dried membrane was immersed in deionized water at a given temperature for 24 h, and weighed on an analytical balance until a constant mass was obtained to give the weight of wet AEMs (Wwet).
The swelling ratio of the semi-IPN AEMs in hydroxide form was investigated by immersing the AEMs in deionized water at a given temperature for 48 h. The change of membrane length was calculated as follows:where Lwet and Ldry are the length of wet and dry samples, respectively.
The hydration number (λ), which was defined as the number of absorbed H2O per QA group, was calculated according to the following equation:where WU is the measured water uptake value at room temperature and MH2O is the molecular mass of water (18 g mol−1).
Ionic conductivity (σ, mS cm−1) was measured by using a two-probe conductivity cell connected to an alternating current (AC) impedance spectrometer (Bio-logic VSR-300, FR) over the frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz. A Teflon cell fixture was mounted with a piece of 1 cm × 4 cm sandwiched membrane and the cell was immersed in DI water which was degassed and blanketed with flowing argon gas prior to testing. The membrane resistance was determined under fully hydrated conditions in the longitudinal direction at a set temperature. The ionic conductivity was calculated as follows:where L is the distance between the two reference electrodes (cm), R is the measured ohmic resistance of the membrane (Ω) and A is the cross-sectional surface area of the membrane (cm2). All the impedance measurements were carried out three times for each sample and the average values were reported to calculate the ionic conductivity.
The alkaline stability testing of the semi-IPN membrane was conducted by immersing the membranes into 1 M NaOH solution at 80 °C for 700 h. The sample was taken out at regular intervals and the alkaline stability of the AEMs was determined by the change of IEC, ionic conductivity and dried weight of the aged samples.
Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) fabrication, fuel cell performance and durability testing
The catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) method was used to fabricate the MEA. Pt/C (40 wt%, Johnson Matthey Co.) and ionomer solution (5 wt%, AS-4, Tokuyama, Japan) were mixed together in DI water and isopropanol. After magnetic stirring and ultrasonication, the well-dispersed catalyst ink was sprayed onto both sides of the sIPN-62/30 membrane. The loading of Pt and the ionomer in the catalyst layer were 0.5 mg cm−2 and 20 wt% respectively. The MEA with the active area of 5 cm2 was sandwiched between two pieces of carbon paper (HCP120, HESEN, China) without hot pressing. A commercial fuel cell system (Smart 2, WonATech, Korea) was used to control the cell temperature, H2 and O2 flow rate and humidity. After full activation, the cell was operated at 60 °C with a flow rate of 200 cm3 min−1 for both H2 and O2 and the performance was tested in galvanostatic mode.
The long-term fuel cell durability testing was performed at 60 °C using the sIPN-62/30 membrane. Fully humidified H2 and O2 with a flow rate of 200 cm3 min−1 were supplied into the anode and cathode, respectively. The cell voltage drop as a function of time was measured at a constant current (100 mA cm−2).
