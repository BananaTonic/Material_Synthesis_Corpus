Experimental
Sample preparation
In this study, we used commercial polycrystalline BZCYYb1711 (Kceracell Co. Ltd, Republic of Korea; BET = 7.933 m2 g−1, D50 = 0.6 μm) powder as a solid solution for Y and Yb co-doped BaZrO3 and BaCeO3. First, the powder was heat treated at 800 °C for two hours in the air in order to remove any moisture. Then, the dried powder was pressed uniaxially into a rectangular bar with dimensions of 10 mm × 6 mm × 20 mm at a pressure of one ton, followed by isostatic cold pressing at 150 MPa for 10 min. The pressed bodies were sintered at 1600 °C for 24 hours with slow cooling rates (including prolonged cooling at 0.2 °C min−1 from 1600 to 1400 °C). Finally, the sintered sample was cut into a rectangular parallelepiped specimen and polished over 100 μm to a final size of 2.34 mm × 1.72 mm × 6.80 mm with a smooth surface (roughness below 1 μm) using various types of sandpaper and chemical abrasives.
Physical characterization
Following heat treatment, the powder was evaluated in terms of phase purity and crystal structure using the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) technique. The diffraction patterns were recorded using a D/MAX Ultima III (Rigaku, Japan) diffractometer operated with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 0.15418 nm) in the angular range (2θ) from 10 to 80° at a scanning rate of 2° min−1. The morphology of the fractured surface of the specimen was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Shimadzu, Japan).
Electrochemical measurements
A DC four-probe measurement system was used to investigate the electrical properties of the fully dense BZCYYb1711 sample. This analyzer was composed of a digital multimeter (Keithley 2700) and a programmable current source (Keithley 220). All of the conductivity measurements were carried out under various gas conditions with oxygen partial pressure (pO2) in the range −0.65 ≤ log(pO2) ≤ −26.64 and water vapor pressure (pH2O) in the range −3.31 ≤ log(pH2O) ≤ −2.14. The pO2 values were monitored using a zirconia-based oxygen sensor placed in an isotherm furnace. Dry gases were prepared by passing them through a CaSO4 column. Humidified gas was produced by bubbling it through water at a controlled temperature. The saturated water vapor pressure was monitored using a dew point and temperature probe (DMP74A, Vaisala Oyj, Finland). The total conductivity of the sample was measured in a temperature range of 600–750 °C. The voltage values were monitored with the application of a constant current to the sample by adjusting the current value. The electrical conductivity was calculated from the equation , where  is the slope of applied currents and measured voltages, ι is the distance between voltage terminals, and A indicates the area of the specimen.
