Conclusions
A systematic study of the effect of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic block lengths and ion exchange capacity of partially fluorinated multiblock copolymer mPEs with long head-group tethers was undertaken to explore the relationship of the chemical structure, morphology and properties of the mPEs AEMs. The chemical structure was studied via one-dimensional 1H NMR, 19F NMR, NOE, and two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectra. Only one tether could be attached per hydrophilic repeat unit at each time. The formation of ion conductive nano-channels for hydroxide ion transport due to nanophase separation of the multiblock copolymers greatly improved the ionic conductivity and reduced the water uptake. Multiblock copolymer mPE-X5.4Y7-2 showed the highest ionic conductivity, 119 mS cm−1 at 80 °C, but not the highest IEC, because it formed efficient channels. The ratio of ionic conductivity to water uptake of the multiblock copolymers was high. For example, mPE-X3.1Y8-2 had very high ionic conductivity up to 94.0 mS cm−1 at 80 °C, but only 26.7% water uptake. From DSC measurements of the number of freezable water and bound water molecules, the number of bound water molecules per ion of two-tether polymers was 4.5 to 5. In addition, the bound water played the dominant role in the hydroxide ion transport within the channels. The multiblock copolymer AEM showed good thermal, mechanical stability and excellent alkaline stability. The ionic conductivity was hardly changed after soaking the membrane in 1 M NaOH solution at 60 °C for 1000 h. Oxygen transport properties were also investigated. The mPEs AEM with higher ionic conductivity showed lower oxygen diffusivity and permeability, which means that the oxygen crossover problem was less severe.
