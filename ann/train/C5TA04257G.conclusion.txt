Conclusions
In summary, a flexible pendant imidazolium cation is successfully tethered to poly(arylene ether sulfone)s via the Williamson reaction under mild conditions. A comparison with traditional benzyl-type AEMs shows that the AEMs containing flexible side chain pendants with imidazolium cations exhibit higher ionic conductivity. This is probably due to the formation of inter-connected nano-channels resulting from the well-defined hydrophobic/hydrophilic phase-separated structure. In addition, the structure is also favorable to the alkaline stability of the as-prepared AEMs. The water uptake of the ImPES-x membranes varied in the range of 5.73–83.95% at 30 °C and 9.25–90.12% at 60 °C. Meanwhile, the swelling ratio is in the range of 3.63–21.75% at 30 °C and 4.66–39.55% at 60 °C. Furthermore, the membranes also show good thermal stability and mechanical properties. The facile route described in this paper for synthesizing polymers containing flexible pendant imidazolium groups as AEMs may be suitable for other polymer matrices.
