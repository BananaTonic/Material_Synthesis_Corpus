4.Conclusions
A pellet-type hybrid solid electrolyte was prepared by blending LLZO ceramic particles and an ILE as an LLZO–ILE composite/matrix for all-solid-state LIBs. The powder XRD and FT-IR results revealed the chemical stabilities of the LLZO ceramic particles and ILE. Accordingly, the LLZO ceramic particles are enclosed by the ILE, as confirmed by the FESEM elemental mapping of fluorine and sulfur in the ILE at the centers and edges of the composite. The optimized weight ratio of the hybrid solid electrolyte was 80% LLZO ceramic particles, 19% Py14TFSI, and 1% LiTFSI. The hybrid solid electrolyte revealed superior thermal stability (&gt;400 °C) compared with a conventional electrolyte–separator system. The prepared HSE exhibited an ionic conductivity of 0.4 × 10−3 S cm−1 and an impressive electrochemical stability of 5.5 V at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s−1 in the 2.0–5.5 V range. The fabricated cells delivered initial charge–discharge capacities of 144/132 mA h g−1 (Li/LE/LiCoO2) and 140/130 mA h g−1 (Li/HSE/LiCoO2) with good capacity retention up to 150 cycles. Expanding the scope of the present investigation, the unique properties of the HSE were also expressed in a Swagelok-type bipolar (Li/HSE/LiCoO2-SS-Li/HSE/LiCoO2) high voltage (&gt;8 V) pseudo-solid-state LIB, wherein dendrite formation was prevented as compared to a PVdF-LE cell. From these results, it is clear that the electrochemical performance of this HSE is quite promising and it can be used for high voltage pseudo-solid-state LIBs.
