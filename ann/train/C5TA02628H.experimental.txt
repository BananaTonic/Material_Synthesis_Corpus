2.2Synthesis of potassium 4-styrenesulfonyl(phenylsulfonyl)imide
4-Styrenesulfonyl(phenylsulfonyl)imide (SPSIK) was synthesized following the procedure reported by Meziane and co-workers24,25 for the synthesis of 4-styrenesulfonyl(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. 40 ml of dried acetonitrile and 0.087 g (1 mmol) of DMF along with 2 ml of oxalyl chloride were taken in a two-neck flask. The solution was stirred under an argon gas atmosphere at room temperature for 5 h to form a Vilsmeier–Haack complex. On completion of the reaction, a light yellow transparent solution was obtained. Subsequently, 4 grams of 4-styrene sulfonic acid sodium salt was added slowly to the solution under an argon gas atmosphere and then stirred for 24 h. The mixture initially turned yellow and then displayed a light pink color. A NaCl precipitate was separated by filtration and the filtrate (4-styrenesulfonyl chloride) was cooled at 0 °C.
In a two-neck flask, 8.1 ml of triethylamine (58.1 mmol), 3.1 grams of benzenesulfonamide (19.4 mmol) and 2.12 grams of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) were added to 30 ml of dry acetonitrile. The mixture was stirred for 1 h in an argon gas atmosphere and subsequently, the 4-styrenesulfonyl chloride solution cooled at 0 °C was added slowly to the mixture under stirring for the next 16 h. The solvent was removed using a rotavapour and the resulting brown colored mass was dissolved in 50 ml of dichloromethane. The solution was washed with a 4% aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (20 ml) twice followed by washing with 20 ml of 1 M HCl. The potassium salt of 4-styrenesulfonyl(phenylsulfonyl)imide was obtained by neutralization of the acid moiety in a molar excess aqueous solution of K2CO3. The resulting suspension was stirred at room temperature for 1 h followed by filtration and drying. The resulting light yellow colored solid was further recrystallized in water for 24 h at ambient temperature followed by storing in a refrigerator for 12 h. The water was decanted and the compound was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain dried potassium 4-styrenesulfonyl(phenylsulfonyl)imide in 50% yield.

2.3Synthesis of Speier's catalyst
Speier's catalyst, which conducts hydrosilylation, was synthesized following the procedure adopted earlier by Chung and Kim.40 50 ml of Na dried 2-propanol was taken in a dark colored bottle in which 1 gram of chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O) was dissolved. The bottle was kept for four weeks in a shelf for the formation of Speier's catalyst.
2.4Synthesis of lithium 4-styrenesulfonyl(phenylsulfonyl)imide grafted polymethyl hydrogen siloxane (SG) electrolyte
A lithium 4-styrenesulfonyl(phenylsulfonyl)imide grafted poly(methylhydrogensiloxane) (SG) electrolyte was synthesized via a hydrosilylation reaction in the presence of Speier's catalyst (Scheme 1). The SPSIK molecules were grafted onto the poly(methylhydrogen siloxane) (PMHS) chains, following the method previously reported.41–43 0.2 ml of PMHS was mixed in 10 ml of THF while 1.37 grams of SPSIK was dissolved in 20 ml of DMSO. Both solutions and 0.1 ml Speier's catalyst were taken in a 2-neck round bottom flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a condenser. To avoid moisture, all operations were performed in a glovebox. The mixture was stirred in an argon atmosphere at room temperature for 24 h followed by stirring at 80 °C for another 24 h. The completion of the hydrosilylation reaction was confirmed by the in situ FTIR spectrum of the product, in which the sharp and intense peak at 2267 cm−1, corresponding to the stretch of the Si–H bond, disappeared. The solvent was removed under vacuum using a freeze-dryer. To remove the unreacted moieties and other impurities, the product was washed with THF, acetone and methanol. Subsequently, the product was dried at 100 °C for 12 h, producing a sticky solid material. To remove the stickiness, the material was heated with acetonitrile at an elevated temperature followed by THF addition upon cooling to retrieve the product. The material was then isolated by filtration and dried at 100 °C. The process was repeated thrice to obtain a non-sticky light yellow colored solid. Finally, the product was crushed to a fine powder form with a mortar and pestle and dried further at 100 °C in a vacuum oven.
Synthesis of the SG electrolyte.
The product was placed in 50 ml ethanol with stirring and, subsequently, lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) (in excess) was added for the exchange of potassium ions with lithium ions. The solution was heated at 50 °C for 12 h. A white precipitate of potassium perchlorate was filtered out and the solution was removed with a rotary evaporator. The excess of LiClO4 was removed upon solubilization of the solid in DMSO followed by re-precipitation with THF. The final product was dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 12 h.

2.5PVDF-HFP/SG membrane preparation
SG and PVDF-HFP were taken in 1 : 2 proportion and dissolved in 5 ml of a DMF solvent at 60 °C for 6 h in a 50 ml glass beaker fitted with a magnetic stirrer. Subsequently, the mixture was drop-cast into a Teflon Petri dish (6 cm diameter) and dried in an oven at 100 °C to evaporate the DMF solvent. The obtained film was further dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 24 h to remove a trace amount of DMF and then transferred to a glovebox. The membrane was punched to obtain a circular film of 1.5 cm diameter. The circular film was subsequently placed in an EC/PC (1 : 1 volume ratio) solution for soaking and then used for further characterization and performance assessment in a battery coin cell.
