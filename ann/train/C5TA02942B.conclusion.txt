Conclusions
In summary, we rationally developed a novel catalyst support with functionalities of a nanowire structure and pore structure via a simple and effective electrospinning method from antimony doped tin oxide. Compared with Sb–SnO2 NP the pore volume, BET surface area and electronic conductivity of Sb–SnO2 NW were slightly increased. However, the structural improvement of the Sb–SnO2 NW contributed to more uniform pore size distributions and enhanced charge transport properties. The catalyst activity of the Sb–SnO2 NW supported iridium oxide catalyst toward the OER was investigated and showed about three times higher catalytic activity than that of the pure IrO2 catalyst. The good catalytic activity was further confirmed by an electrolyser test operated at 80 °C, and the terminal voltage was 1.62 V at 2 A cm−2 with an IrO2 loading of 0.75 mg cm−2 and a Pt loading of 0.2 mg cm−2. At 35 °C and 450 mA cm−2 the cell showed good stability with a period of 646 hours.
