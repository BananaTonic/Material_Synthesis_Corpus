2.1.Preparation of HSE
To prepare the HSE, Py14TFSI (Sigma), LiTFSI (Sigma), and the LLZO powder were mixed together by ball-milling at 40 rpm for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere (25 °C). The homogenized, blended mixture, labeled as the HSE, consisted of 80 wt% LLZO, 19 wt% Py14TFSI, and 1 wt% LiTFSI. Details regarding the selection of the optimal weight ratios are provided in the Results and discussion section.
Synthesis of Li7La3Zr2O12: the LLZO powder was synthesized using a solid-state reaction with a stoichiometric mixture of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, pretreated at 200 °C for 24 h, Kojundo), lanthanum oxide (La2O3, pretreated at 900 °C for 24 h, Kanto), zirconium dioxide (ZrO2, Kanto), and tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5, Aldrich). The mixture of precursors was ball-milled, subjected to calcination at 900 °C for 3 h, and then sintered at 1200 °C for 10 h. The resultant LLZO powder was ground well, affording an average particle size of 1 μm.
2.2.Characterization techniques and electrochemical studies
The phase stability of LLZO powder with ionic liquids (pellet form) has been investigated through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα X-ray source and the measurements were recorded with a 2θ range of 10–80°. The chemical stabilities of LiTFSI, Py14TFSI, LiTFSI in Py14TFSI and a pellet type HSE were examined by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy with a FT interferometer (VERTEX 80v, Bruker Optics) in the range 700–3000 cm−1. The surface morphology of the HSE was investigated by the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) technique (Hitachi, S-4800) at 10 kV operating voltage. The thermal stability of the hybrid solid electrolyte was analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 700 °C in air using TA SDT 2960 simultaneous DSC-TGA instruments.
Further, for the electrochemical studies the HSE pellets were used for lithium cell fabrication under the CR-2032 configuration with a commercial cathode material, LiCoO2. The coin cells were assembled using lithium metal foil as the anode and commercial LiCoO2 material coated on Al foil as the cathode with a new pellet type hybrid solid electrolyte in the place of commercial 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte and a Celgard® separator. The LiCoO2 electrodes were fabricated using doctor blade slurry coating (80% active material, 10% SP-carbon and 10% PVdF in NMP) on Al foil and then dried at 80 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. The fabricated electrodes were roll pressed and cut into a circle (10 mm diameter) with an optimized electrode mass density of 3 mg cm−2 of active material. The lithium cells were assembled in an argon-filled glove box with oxygen and moisture levels less than 0.1 ppm. Subsequently, the lithium cells were subjected to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (7 MHz to 50 mHz), linear sweep voltammetry (0.2 mV s−1) using a Biologic Science Instruments VSP 300 and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling studies between 3.0 and 4.3 V with a constant current density of 0.1C rate at 25 °C.
