Conclusions
PANI with high surface area and purity was synthesized via CND-induced nucleation. In the polymerization reactions, the CNDs induced homogeneous nucleation and head-to-tail coupling of aniline dimers. As a result, PANI-CND exhibited a more than 3.5 times larger surface area (43.6 m2 g−1) than pristine PANI (12.43 m2 g−1), and produced highly conductive films (electrical conductivity: 774 S cm−1) with an increased surface roughness. PANI-CND films were successfully utilized as CEs for DSSCs, exhibiting a higher conversion efficiency (η = 7.45%) than those of both the conventional Pt CEs (η = 7.37%) and the CEs made with pristine PANI (η = 5.60%). The procedures detailed herein provide an efficient and facile means of producing high-performance PANI electrodes for DSSCs or other applications.
