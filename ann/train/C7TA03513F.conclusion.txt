Conclusions
In summary, SiO2–TiO2 binary nanoparticles are synthesized via a facile one-pot biomimetic mineralization process. The mole ratio of SiO2 to TiO2 in SiO2–TiO2 can be precisely manipulated and the obtained binary nanoparticles possess a higher surface area compared with alkali-catalyzed nanoparticles. The acid–base pair functionalized SiO2–TiO2 binary nanoparticles are incorporated into a Nafion matrix to adjust the vehicle-type and Grotthuss-type proton conduction mechanisms simultaneously. The interaction between functional groups on SiO2–TiO2 binary nanoparticles and the Nafion polymer endows the hybrid membrane with good inorganic–organic interfacial compatibility. Due to the efficient proton transfer ability of –SO3H/–NH2 pairs, the prepared hybrid membranes show enhanced proton conductivity compared with recast Nafion under both 100% RH and low RH conditions. At 26.1% RH, 80 °C, the Nafion/Si1–Ti2-160 membrane shows a high proton conductivity of 1.37 × 10−2 S cm−1, which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the recast Nafion. The study suggests that biomimetic mineralization can be used as an attractive method to design multifunctional nanoparticles and fabricate novel PEMs.
