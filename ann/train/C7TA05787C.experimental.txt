Materials
Oxalyl chloride, 4-styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt, benzenesulfonamide, triethylamine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), lithium hydroxide (LiOH), maleic anhydride (MA), 2,2′-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP, molar mass 400 000 g mol−1) were all purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Acetonitrile, N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dichloromethane (DCM) were obtained from J&amp;K Scientific Co., Ltd. and purified by distillation before use.
Synthesis of the SSPSILi monomer
The SSPSILi monomer was synthesized according to the published procedures.23 Dried acetonitrile (50 ml), oxalyl chloride (25 mmol), and DMF (1 mmol) were added into a two-necked flask, and the solution was stirred under an argon gas atmosphere at room temperature for 5 h to form a Vilsmeier–Haack complex. A light yellow solution was obtained at the end of the reaction. Next, 4-styrene sulfonic acid sodium salt (25 mmol) was slowly added into the solution and the mixture was stirred for 24 h. The solid residue was discarded by filtration, while the filtrate (4-styrenesulfonyl chloride) was concentrated to 10 ml using a Rotavapor and cooled at 0 °C. Dry acetonitrile (10 ml) was placed in a two-necked flask, and stirred under an argon gas atmosphere. Benzenesulfonamide (22 mmol), DMAP (22 mmol), and triethylamine (66 mmol) were successively added to the solvent. When all components were completely solubilized, the mixture was cooled to 0 °C. Then, the solution of 4-styrenesulfonyl chloride in dried acetonitrile was added to the mixture with a syringe for 5 min. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was kept at 0 °C for 0.5 h, and then stirred for 48 h at room temperature. The solvent was removed using a Rotavapor, and the resulting brown mass was dissolved in 50 ml of DCM. The DCM layer was washed with a 4% aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (40 ml) and 1 M hydrochloric acid (20 ml). The lithium salt of 4-styrenesulfonyl(phenylsulfonyl)imide was obtained by a neutralization reaction between LiOH and the acid monomer formed from the rotary evaporation of the DCM layer. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, 25 °C, TMS): δ = 7.6 (m, 4H; Ph), 7.41 (m, 5H; Ph′), 6.76 (dd, J(H,H) = 17.7, 10.9 Hz, 1H), 5.89 (d, J(H,H) = 17.6 Hz, 1H), and 5.33 (d, J(H,H) = 10.9 Hz, 1H). HRMS (ESI) m/z: [M − H]+ calculated for SSPSILi, 322.02; found, 322.2.
Synthesis of the P(SSPSILi-alt-MA) alternating copolymer
In the copolymerization of maleic anhydride and vinylbenzyl-terminated monomers, the polymerization type is alternating when the former is in excess. SSPSILi (2 mmol) and MA (2.1 mmol) were used as monomers with a feed ratio of SSPSILi : MA = 1 : 1 by mole, AIBN (0.01 mmol) as the initiator, and DMF (6 mL) as the solvent. The reaction mixture was kept at 60 °C for 24 h, and the target product P(SSPSILi-alt-MA) was obtained by reprecipitation with THF three times. The number-averaged molecular weight (Mn) of P(SSPSILi-alt-MA) is 43 500 g mol−1, which was obtained from the gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) measurement in DMF.
Preparation of the PVDF-HFP/P(SSPSILi-alt-MA) SPE membrane
The lithiated polymer and PVDF-HFP were dissolved in 10 ml of DMSO under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, the transparent solution was drop-cast into a flat glass dish, and dried at 80 °C in order to evaporate the solvent. The obtained membrane was then transferred to a vacuum oven and dried at 80 °C to remove the trace amount of DMSO. The thickness of the electrolyte membrane is 51 μm which was measured using a micrometer caliper. Before the electrochemical tests, the electrolyte membrane was cut into circles 19 mm in diameter and placed in a solution of ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate (EC/PC) with a volume ratio of 1 : 1 for soaking.
Characterization of the SSPSILi monomer and P(SSPSILi-alt-MA) alternating copolymer
1H NMR spectra were obtained on a 400 MHz instrument (AVANCE III 400 MHz, Bruker, Swiss) with dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 as the inner reference. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer (Germany). The GPC measurement was performed on a Waters 2414 instrument (USA). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was carried out on an Agilent 1200 HPLC-6310 spectrometer (USA). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15 nm) at a scan rate of 8.0° min−1, a voltage of 40 kV, and a current of 200 mA. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) study was performed on a Q20 instrument (TA. Inst., USA) in a N2 atmosphere with a flow rate of 50 ml min−1. The thermal stability was analyzed with a thermogravimetry instrument (Q2000, TA. Inst., USA) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 gas flow rate of 50 ml min−1. The morphology and microstructure of the electrolyte membranes were probed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S4800, HITACHI, Japan). Mechanical properties were measured using a universal testing machine (XQ-1C, XinXian, China), fitted with a 0.1 N load cell and at a loading rate of 3 mm min−1.
Electrochemical measurements
To evaluate the electrochemical stability of the PVDF-HFP/P(SSPSILi-alt-MA) SPE membrane, linear-sweep voltammetry was carried out using the cell configuration of Li|SPE membrane|SS (stainless steel). The linear-sweep voltammetry was implemented at room temperature from 1.5 to 5.5 V (versus Li+/Li) at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 on an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, Chenhua, China).
The ionic conductivity of the SPE membrane was measured in the frequency range of 0.1 to 106 Hz by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), using the cell configuration of SS|SPE membrane|SS, from 25 °C to 90 °C with an increment of 10 °C. Impedance data were gained with the electrochemical workstation. The ionic conductivity was calculated according to the following eqn (1):1where L, S, and R stand for the membrane thickness, the membrane area, and the ohmic resistance, respectively.
To calculate the lithium ion transference number (tLi+), EIS analysis was performed before and after potentiostatic DC polarization, with the sample membrane sandwiched between two lithium electrodes. During the potentiostatic DC polarization, a static potential polarization of 3 mV was applied for 104 seconds until a steady state was reached. EIS was carried out from 1 MHz to 100 Hz at a potential polarization amplitude of 5 mV. The formula used to calculate tLi+ is as follows.2where ΔV is the potential applied across the cell, I0 and IS represent the initial and steady-state currents, and R0 and RS are the initial and steady-state resistances of the passivating layers on the Li electrode, respectively.
The Li symmetric cell with the SPE membrane was assembled as Li|SPE membrane|Li, and the polarization test was performed on a LAND battery test system (CT2001A, LANHE, China). The symmetric cells were charged/discharged for 3 h during each process, using a constant current density of 1.0 mA cm−2.
A Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) or LiFePO4 (LFP) half 2032-type coin cell was assembled with the EC/PC-swollen SPE membrane sandwiched between a lithium metal foil and the Li4Ti5O12 (or LiFePO4) electrode. The electrode was composed of 80 wt% Li4Ti5O12 (or LiFePO4), 10 wt% PVDF, and 10 wt% carbon black. The mass loading of the LTO (or LFP) electrode was 1–2 mg cm−1. All cells were assembled in a glovebox filled with argon. The galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling performance and C-rate capacity of LTO (or LFP) half-cells were recorded on a LAND battery test system (CT2001A, LANHE, China) under a voltage window of 1.0–2.0 V (or 2.5–4.0 V).
The full cell was fabricated with the configuration of LTO|SPE membrane|LFP, where the LTO anode, the prepared electrolyte film, and the LFP electrode were used as the anode, separator, and cathode, respectively. The procedure for full cell testing was the same as that for the half-cells described above, but under a voltage window of 1.0–2.5 V.
