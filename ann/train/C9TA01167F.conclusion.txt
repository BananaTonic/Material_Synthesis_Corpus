Conclusions
In summary, we have designed and synthesized quaternized poly(2,6-dimethyl phenylene oxide)s having piperidinium cations by a versatile Cu(i)-catalyzed click reaction to tune the position of cationic groups within the polymer backbone, e.g., side-chain-type (SCPi), long side-chain-type (LSCPi), and standard benzylmethylpiperidinium AEMs (BPi). The properties of prepared AEMs, including water uptake, morphology, ionic conductivity, and alkaline stability, were investigated in detail and further correlated to the corresponding polymer architecture. In spite of low IEC values, LSCPi showed higher hydroxide conductivity than SCPi and BPi membranes likely as a result of its distinct hydrophilic–hydrophobic phase separation morphology. However, this level of conductivity of the LSCPi membrane is inferior to the corresponding long side-chain-type AEMs with quaternary ammonium cations (LSCQA) (29.0 V s 38.7 mS cm−1 at 20 °C) due to the higher water uptake of the LSCQA sample. Alkaline stability testing in 1 M NaOH at 80 °C indicated the higher stability of the piperidinium-based AEM, and 2% of initial conductivity was lost after 560 h of testing for the LSCPi membrane while 17% for the LSCQA membrane. The LSCPi membrane showed excellent initial performance when applied in alkaline fuel cells and water electrolysis, with a peak power density of 116 mW cm−2 at 60 °C and 300 mA cm−2 at 1.8 V at 50 °C, respectively. The performance decline of AEM-based electrochemical devices was measured over the durability testing at a constant current, but the sources of the performance drop was not related to the chemical degradation of AEMs as convinced by NMR characterization of aged AEMs. Future improvement of the durability of AEMFC and AEM water electrolysis will focus on the MEA fabrication, water management, and optimized testing conditions.
