Experimental
Synthesis
The title compound was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (4.0 g) and KOH (64 g) were dissolved in distilled water (32 ml) with stirring. The mixture was directly added into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 240 °C for 2 days. After cooling to room temperature, plate-like hexagonal crystals were collected by filtration, washed with deionized water and dried in air at ambient temperature.
Crystal structure determination
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of 1 were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD APEX II diffractometer using graphite-monochromated Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at a temperature of 20 ± 2 °C. Data processing was accomplished with the SAINT processing program. The structure of 1 was solved and refined against F2 by full-matrix least-squares techniques with the SHELXTL crystallographic software package. The iron atoms were located first, and then the potassium and oxygen atoms of 1 were subsequently found in the difference Fourier maps.
Characterization
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3300Dv spectrometer. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded in the angular range of 2θ = 10–80° on a Rigaku D-Max 2550 diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). A Perkin-Elmer DTA 1700 differential thermal analyzer and a Perkin-Elmer TGA 1700 thermogravimetric analyzer were used to obtain differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves in air, from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on a VG Scienta R3000 spectrometer with Al Kα (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source.
Ionic conductivities
The complex impedance was measured using an electrochemical analyzer (Ivium Stat, Netherlands). Ground K2Fe4O7 crystals were pressed into a pellet (diameter 10 mm; thickness 0.35 mm) and then annealed in air at 700 °C for 12 hours. The length and cross-sectional area of the crystal along each axis were determined from the SEM image (SEM, JSM-6480LV). For better contact, both sides of the crystal and pellet were pasted with silver plaster and heated at 600 °C. The scanning frequency ranged from 10 Hz to 1 MHz and an ac voltage was applied. The resistance of the compound was obtained from a circle fit of the impedance spectrum, and the conductivity was calculated by taking into account the thickness and area of the single crystal or ceramic pellet. For Hebb–Wagner measurements, a Keithley 6517B electrometer served as an amperemeter.
All-solid-state battery construction and tests
Potassium metal foil was used as the anode. The cathode was prepared by mixing KFeFe(CN)6 powder, K2Fe4O7 powder, acetylene black, and PVDF at a weight ratio of 55 : 25 : 10 : 10. The mixture was coated on pure aluminum foil and dried under vacuum at 120 °C for 12 hours. The battery was assembled by putting the cathode disc and K foil disc on both sides of the K2Fe4O7 ceramic pellet and then packaged in coin cells in an argon-filled glovebox, in which the thickness of the electrolyte was 0.4 mm, and the weight of KFeFe(CN)6 was 0.03 g. Galvanostatic charge and discharge tests were performed in the voltage window of 1.0–3.0 V on a Land-2010 automatic battery tester.
