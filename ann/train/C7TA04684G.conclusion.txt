4.Conclusions
A series of two phase SBEs, combining a liquid phase and a stiff polymer thermoset phase, where the different phases are percolating throughout the SBE have successfully been made using reaction induced phase separation. The domain size of the phase separation and the morphology of the SBEs can be tailored, by changing the monomer structure as well as the ratio between the monomers, to range from an opaque micron scale phase separation to a fully transparent nanoscale phase separation. The SBEs can furthermore be combined with carbon fibers to form a lamina half-cell with both structural integrity and ionic conductivity. Combining the results from the mechanical and conductivity measurements, it is seen that, at ambient temperature, all SBEs exhibit good ionic conductivity in combination with high Eâ€² on a level that allows truly structural batteries to be made.
