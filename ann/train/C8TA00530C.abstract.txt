Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are one of the most promising candidates to solve safety issues such as liquid leaking, fire, and explosions in battery systems. In this work, novel phosphonate-based porous cross-linked gel polymer electrolytes were synthesized by in situ thermal polymerization and applied to sodium-ion batteries. The phosphorus containing GPEs have a high ionic conductivity of 6.29 × 10−3 S cm−1 and an excellent electrochemical stability of up to 4.9 V (vs. Na+/Na), and thus could be used as possible non-flammable electrolytes. The Na3V2(PO4)3/GPE/Na cell using GPEs and a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode yields a high capacity of 110.7 mA h g−1 at 1C rate. Moreover, an excellent long-term cycling stability at 5C rate was observed, retaining 81.8% and 69.2% capacity after long-term 4500 and 10 000 cycles, respectively. When cycled at high temperature (60 °C), the sodium-ion Na3V2(PO4)3 cell with the GPE also exhibits superior cycling stability compared to a battery with a conventional liquid electrolyte. The excellent cycling performances of the SnS2/GPE cell and full cell of SnS2/NVP were also observed, holding great promise for the production of safer phosphonate-containing battery systems.
