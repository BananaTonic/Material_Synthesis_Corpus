Conclusions
Based on the syntheses of a new linear polymer with multi-furan rings (FPU) and liquid hyperbranched multi-maleimide (HSiNCM), a unique thermally reversible self-healing PU film with outstanding thermal resistance and high electrostatic dissipation capacity was first developed. The electrostatic dissipation properties of PU-DA-CNT films are related to the contents of aCNTs. With small loadings of aCNTs (1–2 wt%), the films show excellent electrostatic dissipative properties. The surface resistance, electrostatic attenuation half-life and conductivity of PU-DA-CNT2 are 3.094 × 108 Ω, 0.07 s, and 4.116 × 10−8 S cm−1, respectively. The Tdi value of PU-DA-CNT2 is as high as 283 °C, about 20–40 °C higher than those of conventional PU films. The PU-DA-CNT films can self-heal rapidly after staying at 130 °C for 5 min, and the self-healing capability of the 1st cycle is 92.54%, almost the highest value reported so far. As a result, PU-DA-CNT films have a good application prospect in aerospace, electronics and other relevant fields.
