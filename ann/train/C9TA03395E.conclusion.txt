4.Conclusion
Dopamine was polymerized on the surface of LLZTO nanoparticles and formed a uniform coating layer with 4–5 nm thickness. The PDA coating layer was examined and confirmed by TEM, FTIR, EDS, and XPS. Polydopamine coated LLZTO particles could be dispersed uniformly in PEO and the interfacial bonding between LLZTO and PEO was improved by dopamine modification as shown by a decrease in contact angles of the PEO solution and LLZTO@PDA compared to that of pristine LLZTO. The dopamine modified LLZTO@PDA/PEO composite electrolyte showed enhanced thermal stability compared to the LLZTO/PEO composite electrolyte. The ionic conductivity of LLZTO@PDA/PEO at 30 °C is 1.15 × 10−4 S cm−1, almost double that of LLZTO/PEO. In the temperature range from 80 °C to 20 °C, the ionic conductivity of LLZTO@PDA/PEO is higher than that of LLZTO/PEO. At 50 °C, the interfacial resistance of LLZTO@DOP/PEO is about 65 Ω cm2, which is much lower than that of LLZTO/PEO (308 Ω cm2). The galvanostatic cycling of a lithium symmetrical cell at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 showed stable cycling for Li|LLZTO@PDA/PEO|Li for over 400 h at 50 °C with a small voltage polarization of 30 mV. The galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling of an LFP|SSE|Li solid-state battery at a rate of 0.2C at 50 °C showed that the LFP|LLZTO@PDA/PEO|Li cell delivered a reversible capacity of 147.3 mA h g−1 and retained 99.6% of its capacity after 50 cycles. For both the lithium symmetric cell and LFP all-solid-state battery, cells with the LLZTO@PDA/PEO composite solid-state electrolyte showed superior electrochemical performance to the cells with LLZTO/PEO. This study demonstrates that modifying the interfaces in organic–inorganic composite electrolytes with PDA is an effective way to enhance their thermal stability and electrochemical performance.
