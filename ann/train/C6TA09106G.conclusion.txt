4.Conclusion
In summary, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel SIPE based on IL-decorated PMMA nanoparticles dispersed in LiTFSI/PC. This SIPE exhibits a superior tLi+ of 0.96 and a very high ionic conductivity of 3.13 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature with 11 wt% of PMMA-IL-TFSI nanoparticles. This outstanding performance is attributed to the unique brush-like structure of IL groups tethered to PMMA nanoparticles, which forms extensive nanoparticle-brush domains interacting with one another. The inter-particle space within the domains provides space for ion movement and the anionic IL groups immobilized on the particle surface enable a high level of dissociation of Li+ that further enhances Li+ ion mobility. More importantly, this SIPE possesses a wide redox stability window up to 5.18 V. Its overall properties are clearly shown in a comparison with other electrolytes recently reported in the literature (Table 1). It is also shown to be highly effective in suppressing uneven Li re-deposition and dendrite formation. In addition, an Li/LTO cell using SIPE can achieve a stable discharge capacity of about 126 mA h g−1 over 500 cycles at room temperature under a 1C rate, as well as superior rate performance. On the other hand, this SIPE exhibits shear-thinning behavior which can be advantageously utilized in electrolyte processing. Considering all these favorable features, the developed PMMA-IL-TFSI/LiTFSI SIPE is a potential candidate for high-performance Li batteries.
