Crystal structure and stability of Li3O(BH4)
Given the similar ionic radii of BH4− and Br−,16,17 we expected that Li3O(BH4) could be stabilized in the same cubic phase as Li3OBr, where BH4 would occupy the Br sites. However, unlike Br atoms, the BH4 cluster has a tetrahedral symmetry. Thus, one also has to determine the orientation of the BH4 tetrahedron. After an extensive testing for different starting orientations based on three high-symmetric cases as shown in Fig. S3 of the ESI, it is found that BH4− adopts a C3v orientational symmetry in the ground state. The optimized structure is given in Fig. 1a with a = b = c = 3.996 Å and α = β = γ = 90.0°. The Bader charge analysis suggests that the BH4 cluster acts just like a halogen by bearing one negative charge.
The dynamical stability of the Li3O(BH4) lattice is confirmed by calculating the phonon dispersions. The results are given in Fig. 1b. The modes around 20 THz (∼80 meV) and below are due to the translational and rotational modes of the BH4− units. The dispersion-less bands above 40 THz (∼160 meV) start to involve large distortions of BH4−. These are shown by the cartoons (ESI) made according to the eigenvectors of these modes at the Γ point. The thermal stability of Li3O(BH4) is tested by carrying out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at constant temperature and pressure. The radial distribution functions (pair correlation functions) of O–O, Li–O and O–B calculated from the MD trajectory data at 400 K and 600 K are shown in Fig. 1c. No melting of the crystal is observed, indicating that the melting point of Li3O(BH4) should be higher than that of Li3OA (A = halogen).12 The linear thermal expansion coefficient estimated from the MD data by comparing the averaged volumes at different temperatures is about 3 × 10−5 K−1 which is not far from those of Li3OA (2.1 × 10−5 K−1 and 1.8 × 10−5 K−1 for A = Cl and Br, respectively12). The calculated electronic density of states using the HSE06 functional is given in Fig. 1d. It shows a large band gap of 7 eV which is significantly higher than those (around 5 eV) of Li3OA (A = halogen). The valence and conduction bands are contributed by O and Li just as seen in Li3OA (A = halogen). These results suggest that Li3O(BH4) would have a larger ESW.
Conduction mechanism
Defects31–33 are often the prerequisites for fast-ion conduction in lithium superionic conductors. For the LiRAP family, although a complex emergent process involving a pair of interstitial Li atoms and a three-atom hopping that shows low energy barriers has been identified, the formation energy of such an interstitial defect is quite large, making it unlikely to be the major contributor to the superionic conductivity.13 Based on this, to investigate the conduction mechanism of Li3O(BH4), we will only consider effects of the simplest defects which include a Schottky pair involving Li+ and BH4− vacancies (VLi–VBH4), a Schottky pair involving 2Li+ and O2− vacancies (V2Li–VO) and a Frankel defect consisting of interstitial Li with a substitutional O atom on the site of BH4. The formation energy and the binding energy that measure the strength of attractive interaction between paired defects20 are summarized in Table 1. Although a migration path with an extremely low energy barrier of about 0.04 eV is identified for the defect of  as shown in Fig. S4 of the ESI, the binding energy of the defect is relatively high, indicating that the motion of the interstitial Li will be localized by the substitutional oxygen. Also, such a defect is unlikely to appear due to its high formation energy (twice as much) compared to the defects with Li+ vacancies. On the other hand, the VLi–VBH4 defect has the lowest binding energy and formation energy and should be the major contributor to the fast Li+-ion conductivity inside the material.

Formation energyBinding energyVLi–VBH41.170.10V2Li–VO1.210.902.060.73Having established that the Li+ vacancy is responsible for the superionic conductivity of Li3O(BH4), which is similar to the case of Li3OA (A = halogen),11,12 we calculate the migration barrier of Li+ hopping to the vacancy along the edge of the Li6O octahedron as shown in Fig. 1a. Because of the aspherical symmetry of the BH4− in Li3O(BH4), there are 12, instead of 1, possible pathways for the migration of Li. The averaged energy barrier is found to be 0.344 eV which is very similar to the barrier of 0.367 eV (ref. 12) in Li3OCl. With a BH4− vacancy along the route, the migration barrier rises to a much higher value, 0.493 eV, due to the positive residual charge and the local distortion around the BH4− vacancy. A similar phenomenon has also been observed in Li3OA (A = halogen) with the halogen vacancy. The diffusion coefficient (D) at each temperature is obtained by a linear fit to the data of mean square displacement (MSD) of the lithium ion against the simulation time. The Arrhenius model is then used to fit to the diffusion coefficients at different temperatures to obtain the Li+ conductivity at room temperature and the activation energy. The results of MSD and the D vs. temperature relationship are shown in Fig. 2b and c, respectively. The activation energy is 0.301 eV, which is almost identical to the calculated value of 0.303 eV in Li3OCl12 by the same theoretical method. The calculated conductivity of Li3O(BH4) at room temperature is 0.10 × 10−3 S cm−1 which is close to 0.12 × 10−3 S cm−1 of Li3ClO with the Li+ vacancy obtained by the same method. The method tends to underestimate the absolute value of the conductivity due to the fixed volume during the MD simulations.12 Given that, in the experiment, the room-temperature conductivity of Li3ClO is 0.85 × 10−3 S cm−1,11,12 it is expected that Li3O(BH4) would reach a similar Li+ conductivity at room temperature. We reckon that, in Fig. 1c, the little scatter of the data points about the line generated according to the Arrhenius model may be due to the error from the linear fitting of the MSD data. A more accurate value of the Li+ conductivity of Li3O(BH4) awaits to be obtained from future experimental measurements.

The pink curve is the MSD from a MD simulation at 1500 K with fixed BH4−. (c) Fitting to the diffusion coefficients at different temperatures using the Arrhenius model.
As mentioned before, only the modes beyond 40 THz (160 meV ∼ 2000 K) involve serious distortions of BH4−. Thus, the BH4− clusters can be approximated by rigid tetrahedra under thermal excitation at temperatures below 1500 K. It is found that the translational and rotational motions of BH4− play the key role in the superionic conduction of Li3O(BH4), since, after freezing BH4−, the superionic conductivity of Li+ disappears, as shown by the MSD in Fig. 2c (pink line from MD at 1500 K).
We also find that the migration of Li+ is not likely to be due to the so-called “paddle-wheel mechanism”, where BH4− ‘kicks’ (or attracts) the Li+ ion around through its rotation.34 In our 1500 K MD simulation lasting over 100 ps, we estimate the averaged instant surface speed of the H atom of the rotating BH4− unit to be about 0.2 Å fs−1, while the highest instant speed of Li+ presence is of the order of 10−2 Å fs−1 – an order of magnitude smaller than the surface speed of BH4−. Also, the averaged velocity correlation, defined as the normalized dot product between the instant velocity of Li+ and its nearest H atom, is a negative number close to zero. Had Li+ ions been ‘kicked’ by the H atom in BH4−, the speed of Li+ ions should have been of the same order as the speed of the H atom and the averaged velocity correlation should be non-negligibly positive.
In our model with the Li+ vacancy, the Li+ ion migrates from the A1 site to the A2 site as shown in Fig. 3a. Each site is coordinated with four BH4− units. The interaction potential created by each of the BH4− units on the Li+ ion can be expressed by a multipole expansion1where q = −e is the total charge of the BH4− superhalogen and r⃑ the vector from boron (B) at the center of the BH4− unit to the Li+. p⃑ is the dipole moment generated by the charge distribution inside the BH4− unit,2where qHi = −0.25e is the charge on each H atom, R⃑i represents the coordinates of each H atom and r⃑i is the relative coordinate of each H atom from the boron center. Qij is the quadrupole term,3where qk is the charge on each H atom and Rik is the ith coordinate of the kth H atom. In eqn (1), both the dipole and the quadrupole terms are determined by the orientational symmetry of the BH4− unit inside the cubic cell.
(a) The model we used to study the conduction mechanism of Li3O(BH4). A1 and A2 indicate the Li+ sites. Each site is coordinated by four BH4− tetrahedra (as highlighted in yellow) and experiences the potential generated by these BH4− units with certain orientational symmetry. Curves 1 and 2 show the possible potential barriers along the migration pathway of Li+ ions according to different orientations of the BH4− rotors. (b) The schematic configurations of the BH4− tetrahedron inside a cube having Td, D2d, C2v and C3v symmetries. With each symmetry group, the potential surfaces (dipole + quadrupole terms in eqn (2) and (3)) generated by four BH4− rotors in a region of 0.1 Å × 0.1 Å square are calculated for all the symmetrically equivalent orientations in the group. (c) Orientations of BH4− rotors around the fastest Li+ ions in the simulation. (d) Orientations of BH4− rotors that generate the minimum potential. (e) Orientations of BH4− rotors that generate the maximum potential. (f) Orientations of BH4− rotors that generate zero potential.
To understand the relationship between the orientational symmetry of the BH4− tetrahedron and the magnitude of the interaction potential in eqn (1), we first note that there are four distinctive symmetry groups of a tetrahedron in a cubic field35 – Td, D2d, C2v and C3v, as shown schematically in Fig. 3b. The Td, D2d, C2v and C3v groups have 2, 6, 8 and 12 symmetrically equivalent orientations, respectively. In the ESI, we show for each group the needed symmetry operations to get one orientation from another. For each group, we calculate the dipole plus quadrupole terms of the in-plane interaction potential created by four BH4− atoms with certain orientations in a region (0.1 Å × 0.1 Å square) around the Li site (e.g. the region around the A1 site in Fig. 1a). The results are shown in Fig. 3b for all the symmetrically equivalent orientations in each group. One can see that, due to certain orientational symmetry, the dipole and quadrupole terms will be zero, as in the case of the Td group. The orientation of the C3v group, which is the ground state orientation (Fig. 1a), gives the lowest potential of the order of (1/4πε0) × (−10−3e Å−1) ≈ 10−2 V (e is the electron charge in coulomb). The potential difference of the C3v group vs. the Td, D2d and C2v groups is large enough to make a Li+ ion reach a speed of the order of 10−2 Å fs−1 – the highest speed observed in our MD simulation if all the potential energy is converted to the kinetic energy of a Li+ ion. In each group, the symmetrically equivalent orientations would generate different dipole plus quadrupole terms and there exists some degeneracy in each case. The order of magnitude of the potential, however, is solely determined by the symmetry group. Since, upon thermal excitation, the BH4− units are expected to be randomly oriented, the potential exerted on Li+ ions in the real case is generated from a combination of different orientational symmetries. Therefore, according to the above analysis, there must be a spatial variation of the potential felt by the Li+ ions in the material. And the maximum descent of the potential surface can reach the order of 10−2 V.
It is possible to define a set of order parameters to characterize the four symmetry groups of the BH4− rotor,35456(xi, yi, zi) are the coordinates of the H atoms of the BH4 rotor with the origin at the central B atom. The calculated values of the order parameters for the four symmetry groups are given in Table 2.

〈M12〉〈M22〉〈M52〉Td100D2d00C2v0C3v0With these order parameters, we analyze the orientations of the BH4− rotors around the highest-speed Li+ ions in our MD data over 100 ps by decomposing each rotor's orientation into three symmetric groups D2d, C2v and C3v. We do not consider the Td group at this point, given that the group is highly symmetric and a random rotor is unlikely to adopt the symmetry. For each rotor, its three order parameters can be written as789where a12, a22 and a32 measure the partial contribution from D2d, C2v and C3v, respectively, to the total orientation of a random rotor. They satisfy the normalization condition, a12 + a22 + a32 = 1. The analyzed result of the MD data is shown in Fig. 3c. There are three apparent lines in the D2d–C2v–C3v triangle. The first is along the diagonal of the C3v–C2v plane, which shows the mixing of C2v and C3v symmetries of the orientation. The second line is on the diagonal plane of the plotted cubic box, which shows the mixing of the C3v–C2v–0.5D2d symmetries of the rotor orientation. The third line is along the diagonal of the D2d–C2v plane, which shows the mixing of C2v–D2d symmetries of the rotor orientation. To see the origin of these three featured lines, we carry out a simulation by generating four randomly oriented rotors and calculate their dipole plus quadrupole potential (eqn (2) and (3)) at the Li+ site. It turns out that all the data points with the minimum potential (∼−0.05 V in our calculation) fall on the first line of C3v–C2v mixing, as shown in Fig. 3d. The data points with the maximum potential (∼+0.02 V in the calculation) all fall on the first and the second line of the C3v–C2v mixing and C3v–C2v–0.5D2d mixing, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3e. All the data points having zero potential fall on the first, the second and the third line of the C3v–C2v mixing, the C3v–C2v–0.5D2d mixing and the D2d–C2v mixing, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3f. These results suggest that, since the orientations that entail the minimum, maximum and zero potential are mixing together along the featured lines, the potential created by the BH4− rotors will have a temporal variation and can readily show large fluctuations.
According to the above discussions, the variation of the potential surface caused by the translation motion of the BH4− and the change of its orientation can constantly deliver kinetic energy to the Li+ ion on-site (like a jumping ball on a constantly moving sheet), enhancing the thermal vibration of Li+. The spatial variation of the potential according to different BH4− rotors on different sites can facilitate the migration of the Li+ ion over long distances throughout the crystal. The BH4− super-ions serve more like ‘rotating gates’34,36 generating lower potential profiles along the migration pathway of the Li+ ion, as shown by the schematic potential curves (1 compared to 2) from the A1 site to the A2 site in Fig. 3a.
Mechanical properties
Lightweight batteries with excellent flexibility are necessary to power wearable electronics and implantable medical devices. Given the weight of Li3O(BH4) being only about half of those of Li3OA (A = halogen), we find that the material also shows favorable mechanical properties. From the phonon spectrum (Fig. 1b), we extract the elastic tensors of Li3O(BH4) from the acoustic branches at the three wave vectors [ξ, 0, 0], [ξ, ξ, 0] and [ξ, ξ, ξ] (see the Methods section). Other elastic constants are further calculated from the elastic tensors as tabulated in Table 3. For the lithium solid electrolyte, there is a threshold for the shear modulus above which the dendritic growth of the Li anode can be inhibited. For materials with a small Poisson's ratio (close to zero), the threshold is four times the shear modulus of Li metal,37 which is about 35 GPa. The shear modulus of Li3O(BH4) (μ = 51 GPa) is well above this threshold. Compared to typical ductile materials with both small Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, Li3O(BH4) shows a Young's modulus (E = 114 GPa) between those of copper (125 GPa) and aluminum (75 GPa). Its Poisson's ratio (ν = 0.1) is between those of aluminum (0.34) and the carbon fiber (0.045). These indicate that the Li3O(BH4) conductor should have good flexibility.

One way to improve the superionic conductivity is to prepare a material that is chemically and structurally more disordered. It is known that the mixed phase of Li3OCl0.5Br0.5 has a much higher Li+ ion conductivity than both the Li3OBr and Li3OCl phases, reaching 1.94 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature.11,12 We find that the mixed phase of Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5 with a lithium vacancy, as shown by the supercell in Fig. 4a, shows a significantly enhanced Li+-ion conductivity. By fitting to the MSD in Fig. 4b, we calculate the diffusion coefficients at different temperatures and obtain a room-temperature conductivity of 0.21 × 10−3 S cm−1, as shown in Fig. 4c. This value is identical to that of Li3OCl0.5Br0.5 with Li vacancy calculated by the same theoretical method.12 It is noted that although such a method can reproduce the correct relative ratio, i.e. 2 : 1 of Li3OCl0.5Br0.5vs. Li3OCl and Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5vs. Li3O(BH4), it will underestimate the absolute value. Given the same theoretical conductivity of Li3OCl0.5Br0.5 and Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5, it is expected that Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5 can reach a similar Li+ conductivity over 10−3 S cm−1 as Li3OCl0.5Br0.5 does in the experiment. The activation energy of Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5 is 0.299 eV which is also similar to 0.288 eV of Li3OCl0.5Br0.5. Given low activation energies of Li3O(BH4) and Li3O(BH4)0.5Cl0.5, their Li+ conductivity at a high temperature of 400 K would reach 1.3 × 10−2 S cm−1 and 2.6 × 10−2 S cm−1, respectively.

Suggested route to experimental synthesis
In order to verify our theoretical prediction, Li3O(BH4) needs to be synthesized. We should emphasize that hydride-based perovskites have already been synthesized where the halogen/oxygen atoms are replaced by BH4 moieties.19 We reckon that Li3O(BH4) could be synthesized in a similar manner as Li3OA crystals, namely by replacing halogens with BH4 superhalogens. We note that the reaction of Li2O + LiA gives rise Li3OA. To calculate the feasibility of synthesizing Li3O(BH4), we have studied the energetics of the reactions Li2O + LiA → Li3OA and Li2O + LiBH4 → Li3O(BH4). Both reactions are endothermic; while the formation of Li3OA requires 13.9 and 25.8 meV per atom for A = Cl and Br,12 respectively, Li3O(BH4) would require 58.8 meV per atom. We further find that the molar volume of Li3O(BH4) is about 17% more compact than the combined molar volumes of Li2O and LiBH4. However, if we start with Li2O and LiBH4 as clusters, the formation of the Li3O(BH4) cluster instead of the crystal becomes exothermic with about 200 meV per atom (see Fig. S6 in the ESI). Thus, it may be easier to synthesize Li3O(BH4) from Li2O and LiBH4 at the nanoscale under high pressures. We also reckon that using Li2O2 instead of Li2O may introduce lithium deficiencies in the synthesized Li3O(BH4), thus improving its superionic conductivity.
