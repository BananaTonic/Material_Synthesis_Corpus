Conclusion
In this study, we successfully fabricated a free-standing poly(propylene carbonate)/Li6.75La3Zr1.75Ta0.25O12 all-solid-state composite electrolyte for a flexible and ambient-temperature solid lithium battery. The as-obtained PPCL-SPE exhibited an optimum performance in terms of high ionic conductivity (5.2 × 10−4 S cm−1), wide electrochemical window (4.6 V), high ionic transference number (0.75) and satisfactory mechanical strength (6.8 MPa). Furthermore, the PPCL-SPE based solid LiFePO4/Li battery delivered excellent rate capability (5C) and superior cycling stability (95%) at ambient temperature. In addition, the battery still delivered normal charge and discharge profiles even at a wide temperature range between 0 °C and 160 °C. More importantly, such a composite solid electrolyte-based flexible LiFePO4/Li4Ti5O12 solid polymer lithium ion full cell exhibited excellent rate capability and superior cycling stability, showing favorable prospects for the device's application with high capacity and safety. These features, along with the facile preparation, make this type of all-solid-state composite electrolyte very promising for ambient-temperature solid lithium batteries.
