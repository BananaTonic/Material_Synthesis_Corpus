Conclusions
NZSPx (x = 0–0.6) were prepared by means of SA-SSR synthesis. The synthesis method has the potential for use in industrial mass production. Benefiting from the optimized primary powders, NZSPx ceramics exhibit an optimized microstructure after sintering and result in high σtotal. The σtotal of NZSPx increases from x = 0 to x = 0.4, and decreases from x = 0.4 to x = 0.6, which may result from the combined influences of the ratio between the occupied and vacant Na ion sites, TEA between lattice parameters a and c, and the phase transition between the rhombohedral and monoclinic phase at 200 °C–100 °C. The σb and σtotal of the samples can be separated at 25 °C by combining two impedance spectroscopy systems with different frequency ranges. At 25 °C, NZSP0.4 exhibits a σb of 1.5 × 10−2 S cm−1 and a σtotal of 5 × 10−3 S cm−1, which is the best value of all reported polycrystalline Na-ion conductors, and are comparable to common liquid electrolytes of NIBs. A Na/NZSP0.4/Na symmetric cell showed a low interface resistance of 4.1 Ω cm2 and a high cycling performance of 1.8 mA h cm−2 per charge or discharge process, both at 25 °C. The superior σtotal of NZSP0.4, high chemical stability between the NZSP0.4 electrolyte and NVP electrode, and favorable microstructure of both electrolyte and electrode lead to a full-ceramic cell of NVP–NZSP0.4–carbon/NZSP0.4/NVP–NZSP0.4–carbon which was successfully tested at 28 °C with reasonable cycling performances.
