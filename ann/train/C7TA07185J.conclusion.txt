Conclusions
In conclusion, this is the first time that stretchable electrodes were fabricated using the integrated design of stretchable current collectors and binders. The mixing method of core–shell SBAS latex with SWCNTs can decrease the usage of SWCNTs in generating a conductive network, which can tolerate deformation via SWCNT alignment. The results show that the electrode performance is directly related to the conductivity of the current collector. When the conductivity of the current collector is maintained at 10−2 S cm−1 or higher, the electrochemical performance of electrodes using this current collector is similar to that of regular electrodes employing metal current collectors. At this conductivity, the bearable tensile strain is 50%, which should be enough for most wearable devices. The SBAS/SWCNT composite is stable because of the physically cross-linking network. And these PSt cross-linking points have strong π–π conjugated interactions with SWCNTs that help to maintain the stability of the conductive network by anchoring SWCNTs to the copolymer matrix. The elastomeric binder enables active materials and conductive additives to form a stable structure and adhere to the current collector tightly during deformation. The stability of this electrode contributes to the similarity in electrochemical performance between the pre-stretched electrodes and the electrodes subjected to 100 stretching cycles. These stretchable electrodes show great potential to replace rigid ones in batteries used in stretchable and flexible electronics. However, many difficulties, e.g. preparing similar highly stretchable separator and packing materials and some packing issues, are still needed to be resolved before achieving a real highly stretchable battery.
