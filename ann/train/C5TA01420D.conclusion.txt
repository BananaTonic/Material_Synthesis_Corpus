Conclusions
We have designed and synthesized a “side-chain-type” polypropylene-based anion exchange membrane with high base stability using heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalyst mediated polymerization that provides multiple structural variations to allow the tuning of the membrane properties. The side chain type PP-based AEMs exhibited comparable hydroxide conductivity to typical AEMs based on the benzyltrimethyl ammonium motif in spite of their low water uptake. The PP-based AEMs had an unusually high alkaline stability for up to 700 h in 5 M and 10 M NaOH at 80 °C. The steric effects of the long alkyl chains in ‘side-chain-type’ architecture surrounding the quaternary ammonium center are likely the cause of the observed good alkaline stability. Crosslinkable PP-based AEMs were also obtained simply by copolymerization of a thermally crosslinkable monomer. All of the crosslinked membranes had better overall properties including lower water uptake, lower water swelling ratio, better mechanical properties, and lower methanol permeability, compared to those of their uncrosslinked counterparts, while having comparable hydroxide conductivities. A combination of good thermal and chemical stability, excellent mechanical properties and excellent balance between the hydroxide conductivity and swelling or methanol transport makes the PP-based membrane attractive as an AEM material for alkaline fuel cell applications. We consider that this ‘side-chain-type’ polypropylene synthesized by commercial heterogeneous Ziegler–Natta catalyst mediated polymerization could lead to new materials for the production of AEMs that meet the demanding challenges of alkaline fuel cells and other electrochemical processes. The general approach is versatile for varying the length of the side-chain and the cations, which may lead to further tuning and refinement of AEMs to address various separations and energy-focused applications.
