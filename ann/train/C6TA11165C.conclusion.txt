Conclusions
Novel hybrid PEO20–NaClO4–5% SiO2–x% Emim FSI (x = 50, 70) solid electrolytes for Na-metal batteries were prepared via a mechanochemical route. The hybrid design leads to a superior solid electrolyte that can satisfy the various requirements for use in practical solid-state Na-based batteries, for example, high room-temperature conductivity, stable conduction capability with time evolution, a wide voltage stability window, suitable mechanical property, and good interfacial characterization. The hybrid PEO20–NaClO4–5% SiO2–70% Emim FSI solid electrolyte demonstrates red–ox processes and interactions between Emim FSI, silicon and PEO, thus forming an integrated structure, and shows a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 × 10−3 S cm−1 at ambient temperature and a stable ambient-temperature conductivity of 7 × 10−4 S cm−1, as well as a voltage stability window of 4.2 V vs. Na/Na+, which is sufficient for most of the Na cathode materials. The Na+ transference number of PEO20–NaClO4–5% SiO2–70% Emim FSI is 0.61. A prototypical Na-metal battery using hybrid PEO20–NaClO4–5% SiO2–70% Emim FSI as the solid electrolyte exhibits promising long-term cycling capability at room temperature and an elevated temperature of 60 °C, due to the high and stable ionic conductivity of the hybrid solid electrolyte, and the excellent interfacial stability of the hybrid solid electrolyte against metallic Na and the cathode layer. The characteristic electrical, mechanical and electrochemical performances of the hybrid solid electrolytes introduce new possibilities for their application in safe Na-based batteries.
