Conclusions
In our work, a novel SPE was synthesized by a two-step polymerization process, followed by mixing with solid LiTFSI salts. The target SPE1 showed an ionic conductivity of 0.1 mS cm−1 at 25 °C, and an electrochemical stability window of 5.0 V (vs. Li+/Li) at 60 °C. The special structure for the SPE1 electrolyte ensures a homogeneous current distribution and Li ion deposition, further inhibiting Li dendrite growth. As a result, the all-solid-state LiFePO4/SPEs/Li batteries assembled with SPE1 exhibited a more stable cycling performance and a higher discharge capacity than the SPEx battery. The LiFePO4/SPE1/Li battery has a good cycling stability at 60 °C with a high capacity retention of 98.8% at 0.2C after 100 cycles, and it also delivers good capacity retentions after 50 cycles of 99%, 96%, and 73%, with a rate of 0.2C, at different temperatures of 80, 40, and 25 °C, respectively. SPE1 presents an overpotential value that is stable at 0.08 V during the lithium plating/stripping process, indicating that the growth of lithium dendrites was significantly inhibited. This work provides a promising route to fabricate dendrite-free solid polymer electrolytes for all-solid-state lithium ion batteries.
