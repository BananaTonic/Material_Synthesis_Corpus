2.Experimental procedures and characterizations
2.1Preparation of LAGP pellets
The Li1.5Al0.5Ge1.5(PO4)3 (LAGP) solid-state electrolyte pellet was synthesized via a solid-state reaction method. Stoichiometric amounts of Li2CO3 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) with 10% excess of Li2CO3, Al2O3 (99.98%, Alfa Aesar), GeO2 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar), and NH4H2PO4 (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed by ball-milling at 150 rpm for 4 h in a zirconia jar filled with ethanol. The mixed precursor was then dried at 80 °C for 10 h and then heated at 380 °C for 4 h to evaporate water, decomposed ammonia, and carbon dioxide. The pre-heated power was calcined at 800 °C for 8 h with the heating rate of 5 °C min−1 to obtain the rhombohedral-structured LAGP powder. The calcined powder mixture was ball-milled again with ethanol to obtain small LAGP particles. After this, the LAGP powder was pelletized and sintered at 900 °C for 8 h. The sintered pellets were polished to a thickness of 0.20 mm for assembly of the solid-state batteries. The polished LAGP pellets were washed by deionized water under ultrasonic vibration thrice and then vacuum dried at 80 °C overnight.
2.2Preparation of PAALi solution
Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) (molecular weight 450 000, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in deionized water and magnetically stirred for 12 h to obtain 2 wt% PAA solution. LiOH (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added dropwise into the PAA solution to adjust the pH value of the lithium polyacrylate (PAALi) solution from 3 to 13.5, and then the solution was further magnetically stirred for 12 h.
2.3Preparation of PAALi/LAGP/PAALi
The prepared PAALi solution (2 wt%, pH = 7) was mixed with the ball-milled LAGP powder in the weight ratio of 90 : 10 by magnetic stirring for 10 h. Then, the mixed slurry was tap-coated to the two sides of the polished LAGP pellet, followed by vacuum-drying at 110 °C for 5 h. It was then sputtered with gold (200 s at 20 mA) for further measurement.
2.4Preparation of cathode/anode slurry
To prepare the cathode and anode slurry, commercial LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and RuO2 (99.9%, Aldrich) were respectively mixed with carbon nanotubes (CNT) (diameter 10–20 nm, length 5–15 μm, Shenzhen Nanotech. Port. Co. Ltd), and the PAALi solution in the weight ratio of 90 : 2 : 8 was thoroughly mixed using ball-milling at 120 rpm for 2 h. The mixed slurries were then immediately used for assembling full all-solid-state Li-ion batteries.
2.5Assembly of full all-solid-state Li-ion battery
The dried LAGP pellet was weighed by an electronic scale (METTLER TOLEDO) and then coated with the cathode slurry on one side. The cell was dried at 110 °C for 30 min and further weighed to calculate the mass of the cathode material. Then, the anode slurry was coated, dried, and weighed with the same method. All these steps were performed in ambient conditions without any atmospheric control. After the full-cell was prepared, it was further dried at 80 °C overnight. Gold was sputtered (20 mA, 200 s) on both sides of the battery as the current collector for electrochemical measurements. The edge of the pellet was covered with scotch tape during the sputtering of gold and polished after sputtering to avoid the short circuit between the anode and cathode. To avoid the absorption of moisture from air during the electrochemical measurement, a plastic film was coated on both sides of the full-cell. The two sides were connected to the positive or negative electrode via a feedthrough.
2.6Measurement of electrochemical properties
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of LAGP was tested using a Shimazu XRD-6000/7000 with Cu Kα radiation from 10° to 80° with 1° min−1. FTIR was performed using a GladiATR instrument at room temperature after the PAA and PAALi powder were vacuum-dried at 110 °C for 5 h. The scanning range was from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with a resolution of 2 cm−1. The viscosity of the PAALi aqueous solution was immediately measured after preparation using a CAP 2000+ viscometer at a rotation speed of 800 rpm. The thermal behavior of PAALi was measured using the TA-60WS and DTG-60H instruments from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C cm−1. The galvanic cycle of the LAGP and PAALi/LAGP/PAALi was conducted using a Solartron Analytical 1400 Cell Test system with current density from 5 μA cm−2 to 50 μA cm−2. The microstructure was characterized using a HITACHI S-4300 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). To test the ion conductivity of LAGP, PAALi/LAGP/PAALi, and LNMO/LAGP/RuO2, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a Solartron impedance analyzer in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz with 50 mV perturbation amplitude. This test was performed at room temperature (23.8 °C) in the ambient conditions without any atmospheric protection. For the EIS of PAALi/LAGP/PAALi at various temperatures, an oven (WEISS WKL34) was used for controlling the temperature, and each temperature value was maintained for 30 min. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurement was also performed using a Solartron Potentiostatic at room temperature in air, from an initial voltage of ∼0.2 V to 4.1 V, and then decreased to 0.5 V at a scanning rate of 0.5 mV s−1. The CV test was repeated four times to examine the stability of the redox reaction peaks. The open-voltage was measured using a Solartron 1400 Cell Test system at different intervals of time. The cells were first charged to 4.1 V, followed by open-circuit voltage measurement at different time intervals. The galvanostatic cycling was tested using a MACCOR battery tester in the voltage range of 0.8–4.1 V with current rates of 0.2C and 0.5C at room temperature as well as at 50 °C.
