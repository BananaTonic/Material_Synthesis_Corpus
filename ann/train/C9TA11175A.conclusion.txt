Conclusions
The advancement of new solid-state electrolytes is an important strategy for mitigating leakage and the safety concerns associated with the very reactive Li metal. Highly concentrated liquid electrolytes have previously been suggested as a route to improved lithium cycling and reduced dendrite growth, by decreasing the mass transport limitations hampering conventional electrolytes. Here we have combined these two important strategies, reporting a novel “plastic crystal in salt” electrolyte with 90 mol% Li[FSI] for use in lithium metal batteries. The highly conductive organic ionic plastic crystal [C2epyr][FSI] was used at 10 mol% concentration, imparting the predominantly Li[FSI]-based electrolyte with advantageously soft, quasi-solid state properties. Electrochemical analysis of the electrolyte shows fast ion dynamics, where the high ionic conductivity is dominated by lithium ions with a transference number of 0.68. Additionally, stable lithium plating and stripping behaviour was demonstrated, supported by a reduction in dendrite formation on the lithium surface compared to a liquid electrolyte comprised of the same components. NMR analysis suggests the presence of both a Li[FSI]-rich environment and a second environment of very mobile ions – possibly in a liquid phase contained within the grain boundaries of the overall quasi-solid state material – and supports the assessment of high transference number. Thus, the combination of a small amount of high conductivity OIPC with 90 mol% Li[FSI] is proposed as a new route to quasi-solid state electrolytes with fast target ion transport that supports efficient and stable lithium metal plating and stripping. This approach paves the way for the development of other very high salt content quasi solid-state electrolytes utilising plastic crystals, and the advancement of more stable, safer and efficient lithium metal batteries.
