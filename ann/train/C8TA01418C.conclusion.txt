Conclusion
A new environmentally friendly solid electrolyte, K2Fe4O7, was successfully prepared under hydrothermal conditions, and its structure has been fully characterized. In the crystalline framework, unique 3D channels allow faster and free movement of a large number of mobile potassium carriers. Not only does it show metal-like conductivity at room temperature, but also excellent thermal and electrochemical stability. An all-solid-state potassium metal battery based on the K2Fe4O7 electrolyte exhibited extremely high rate capability and excellent cyclability at room temperature. Our solid electrolyte is suitable for developing potassium batteries with higher energy and power densities in the future.
