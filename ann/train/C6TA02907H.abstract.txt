Progress in nitrile-based polymer electrolytes for high performance lithium batteries
Nitrile or cyano-based compounds have aroused interest in high performance battery electrolyte fields due to their unique characteristics such as a high dielectric constant, high anodic oxidization potential and favorable interaction with lithium ions. Particularly, owing to the presence of a unique plastic-crystalline phase, succinonitrile/salt-based solid electrolytes possess an ultra high ionic conductivity of more than 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. Herein, recent progress in nitrile-based polymer electrolytes has been reviewed in terms of their potential application in flexible, solid-state or high voltage lithium batteries. Factors affecting the ionic conductivity of nitrile-based electrolytes have also been summarized. We hope that fresh and established researchers can obtain a clear perspective of nitrile based polymer electrolytes and our mini review can spur more extensive interest for the exploration of high performance batteries.
