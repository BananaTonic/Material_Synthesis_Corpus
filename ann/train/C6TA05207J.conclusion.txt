4.Conclusions
A novel biodegraded, environmentally friendly and economic CA/PLLA/HNT composite nanofiber membranes was successfully obtained through electrospinning, as a host of GPEs for high performance LIBs. In the CA/PLLA/HNT nanofiber membranes, the crystallization behaviour of the polymeric materials was significantly inhibited, and the HNTs revealed an orientation along the direction of the fiber. The addition of HNTs improved the thermal stability of the polymer nanofiber membranes. High saturated electrolyte uptake and conservation rate were obtained for the CA/PLLA/HNT nanofiber membranes, which resulted in a desirable electrochemical performance of the resulting composite GPEs, including high ionic conductivities, lithium-ion transference numbers, electrochemical working window, and electrochemical stability. The composite GPEs based on CA/PLLA/HNT nanofiber membranes displayed an ionic conductivity of 1.52 × 10−3 S cm−1, which is far larger than other biomass GPEs. The Li/GPE/LiCoO2 cells with composite GPEs based on the CA/PLLA/HNT nanofiber membranes presented outstanding initial discharge capacities, cycle performance and rate performance compared to those of commercial Celgard® 2500. Consequently, the degradable CA/PLLA/HNT nanofiber membranes will be a new type of skeleton material used in GPEs with high performance.
