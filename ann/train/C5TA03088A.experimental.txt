4-Triphenylmethyl-pentafluorodiphenyl ether (b)
To a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, an argon inlet/outlet, a Dean–Stark trap and a condenser, were added 4-triphenylmethylphenol (3.3643 g, 10 mmol), anhydrous K2CO3 (2.0732 g, 15 mmol), NMP (25 mL) and toluene (10 mL). The solution was refluxed at 150 °C for 3 h to complete the azeotropic dehydration process, and then cooled to room temperature. Afterwards, hexafluorobenzene (11.1636 g, 60 mmol) was added into the solution and the mixture was heated at 80 °C for 12 h. And the argon purge was stopped considering the low boiling point (ca. 80 °C) of hexafluorobenzene. The mixture was poured into deionized water to precipitate the product. The precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water and hot isopropanol several times to obtain b. Mp: 203 °C. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 7.40–7.10 (m, 17H), 6.85–6.80 (d, 2H). 19F NMR (470 MHz, CDCl3, δ): −153.7 (d, 2F1), −159.9 (t, F3), −162.1 (t, 2F2). MALDI-TOF: m/z (%) 501.9 (100).
Synthesis of poly(arylene ether)s containing methoxy groups (MPAE-x)
DHDPS (1.5016 g, 6 mmol), DFB (1.1128 g, 5.1 mmol), a (0.3892 g, 0.9 mmol), anhydrous K2CO3 (0.9122 g, 6.6 mmol), NMP (9 mL) and toluene (3 mL) were added into a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an argon inlet/outlet, a Dean–Stark trap and a condenser. The mixture was heated to reflux for 3 h to sufficiently dehydrate. Then the temperature was raised to 180 °C and the polymerization reaction proceeded smoothly for 6 h. The viscous mixture was poured into deionized water and the fibrous polymer was obtained. It was washed with deionized water and isopropanol 5 times and dried in vacuo at 100 °C for 12 h, and PAE-15 was obtained (94%).
Synthesis of poly(arylene ether) precursor containing hydroxyl groups (HPAE-x)
MPAE-15 polymer (2 g, 1.3 mmol) was dissolved in methylene chloride (40 mL) and cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath. Then BBr3 (0.6 mL) was mixed with methylene chloride (6 mL) and added dropwise into the polymer solution. The mixture was stirred for 8 h and then poured into deionized water. The resulting polymer was washed with deionized water and isopropanol 5 times, and then dried in vacuo at 60 °C for 24 h.
Grafting reaction of HPAE-x with monomer b
The grafting reaction was conducted as follows: 1 g HPAE-15 (containing 0.66 mmol hydroxyl group), anhydrous K2CO3 (0.1368 g, 0.99 mmol), NMP (10 mL) and cyclohexane (5 mL) were charged into a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an argon inlet/outlet, a Dean–Stark trap and a condenser. The mixture was dehydrated at 110 °C for 3 h and residual cyclohexane was then removed. Then the mixture was cooled to below 50 °C and monomer b (0.4974 g, 0.99 mmol) was added. The mixture was heated to 80 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into water to give a fibrous polymer. It was washed with deionized water and isopropanol 5 times and dried in vacuo at 100 °C for 12 h, to yield PAE-x polymer.
Sulfonation of PAE-x
A typical sulfonation: PAE-15 polymer (1 g) was dissolved in methylene chloride (30 mL) and the solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. Then the polymer solution was placed in a round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a CaCl2 drying tube. After the solution was cooled to 0–5 °C using an ice bath, 10.4 mL of 1 M chlorosulfonic acid solution in methylene chloride was added dropwise with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h and the product completely precipitated out of the solution. Then the supernatant was decanted and the precipitate was washed with hexane and then deionized water. The sulfonated polymer was dried in vacuo at 120 °C for 12 h to obtain SPAE-15.
Membrane preparation
Sulfonated polymer SPAE-x was dissolved in DMAc to form a clear polymer solution (8 wt%). Then, the solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter and poured onto a clean glass plate, then carefully dried at 60 °C for 12 h and in vacuo at 100 °C for 24 h. The membranes were obtained after evaporation of the solvent. The acidification of the membranes was carried out by immersion in 1 M H2SO4 solution at 80 °C for 4 h and then washed with boiling water 5 times to remove residual acid. The membranes in their acid form were stored in deionized water for further investigation.
Instruments
The structures of the monomer and polymers were characterized by 1H NMR (Varian mercury 300 MHz) and 19F NMR (Bruker Avance III 470 MHz). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured on a Bruker Vector 22 FT-IR spectrometer. The reduced viscosities of polymers were determined using an Ubbelohde viscometer with a 0.5 g dL−1 NMP solution at 25 °C.
Thermal analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the polymers was carried out on a Perkin Elmer Pyris 1 thermal analyzer system with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 100 °C to 800 °C under N2 and air.
Ion exchange capacity
The ion exchange capacity (IEC) values of the membranes were evaluated by titration. The membranes were dried under vacuum and the weights were recorded. Then the membranes were immersed in 2 M NaCl solution for 72 h. The obtained solutions were titrated against a 0.05 M NaOH solution, with phenolphthalein as the indicator. The IEC (meq. g−1) values were calculated from the titration results.
The volumetric IEC (IECv) values were defined as moles of –SO3H versus dry/wet membrane volume:where WU (%) was the water uptake of the membranes, and ρp (g cm−3) and ρw (g cm−3) are the density of polymers and water, respectively.
Water uptake and swelling ratio
The membrane samples were dried under vacuum at 120 °C overnight prior to the measurement. After measuring the lengths and weights of the dry membranes, the samples were immersed in deionized water to reach equilibrium at the desired temperature. Then the lengths and weights of wet membranes were also measured. The water uptake (WU) was calculated aswhere Wdry (g) and Wwet (g) are the weights of dry and corresponding water-swollen films, respectively. The percentage of length gain to original length was taken as the swelling ratio.
Proton conductivity
Impedance of hydrated membranes was performed on a frequency response analyzer/potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research PARSTAT 2273, EG&amp;GPARC, Princeton, NJ) from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz with 10 mV AC perturbation and 0.0 V DC rest voltage. The measurements were carried out with the cells immersed in constant-temperature water or under constant-humidity conditions, and the proton conductivity was determined by:where σ (S cm−1) is the proton conductivity, L (cm) is the distance between the electrodes used to measure the potential, R (Ω) is the membrane resistance, and A (cm2) is the effective area.
Methanol permeability
The methanol permeability test of the membranes was conducted as described in an earlier report.8,22 The methanol concentration was measured by gas chromatography equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (Shimadzu, GC-2010A, Tokyo, Japan). The methanol permeability was calculated by the following equation:where VB (in mL) is the volume of the receptor reservoirs, and A (in cm2) and L (in cm) are the effective area and the thickness of the membrane, respectively. cA and cB (in mol L−1) are the methanol concentration in the feed and in the receptor, respectively. DK (in cm2 s−1) represents the methanol permeability.
Membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and single cell test
Pt/Ru black and 50% Pt/C were used for the anode and cathode, respectively. The catalyst loading was 4 mg cm−2 for both the anode and the cathode and the effective electrode area of the single cell was 9 cm2. The polarization curves of the passive DMFCs were obtained on an Arbin FCTS system (Arbin Instrument Inc. USA). 2 M methanol aqueous solution was fed to the anode at a flow rate of 5 mL min−1 and oxygen was supplied to the cathode at 0.5 L min−1.
Small angle X-ray scattering
Prior to the test, a certain size of membrane sample was immersed in a 1 wt% lead acetate solution for 48 h to obtain the strained membrane. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments of the hydrated membrane samples were performed on a SAXSess mc2 system (Anton Paar, Austria) equipped with a Mythen 1K CCD detector (Dectris, Switzerland). CuKα radiation with a wavelength of λ = 1.524 Å was provided by a General Electric ID 3003 X-ray generator operating at 40 kV and 50 mA. The wave vector (q) was calculated according to:where θ is the scattering angle. The characteristic separation length (d), i.e. the Bragg spacing, was calculated as:
Oxidative stability
Typically, the accelerated oxidative stability test for sulfonated polymers is carried out by using Fenton's reagent (3% H2O2 containing 2 ppm Fe2+). The membrane samples of SPAE-x were soaked in Fenton's reagent at 80 °C for 1 h, and the residual weight was recorded.
Mechanical properties
The mechanical properties of the dry membranes were measured on a AG-I 20 kN Universal Tester (SHIMADZU, Japan) at room temperature and 30% RH. The tensile test was performed at a strain rate of 2 mm min−1. The membranes were cut into a dumbbell shape and reached equilibrium prior to the measurement.
