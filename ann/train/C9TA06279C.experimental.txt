A.Preparation and characterisation of electrolyte
The solid electrolyte, Na11Sn2PSe12, was prepared by ball milling. As precursors we used Na (Aldrich, 99.9%), Sn (Aldrich), red P (Cerac, 99%) and Se (Cerac, 100%). Due to the highly reactive nature of this precursor mixture the amounts used should be limited in lab experiments. Ball milling of the samples discussed further below was conducted using a Fritsch P7 high energy planetary ball mill at 450 rpm for 2 h, 5 h, 10 h or 15 h. To this end precursors were transferred under argon into a 45 ml zirconia vial along with 12 zirconia balls (diameter 10 mm). The ball milled samples were pressed under argon into pellets and kept in alumina crucibles covered by a lid, transferred to a vacuum oven and annealed under vacuum for different annealing times. To understand the effect of time of annealing the ball milled samples were annealed at 500 °C, 550 °C or 600 °C for 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 18 h to optimise the crystallinity and conductivity of the products. The 15 h ball milled sample was annealed at 150 °C, 200 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 500 °C, 550 °C and 600 °C for 6 h.
The annealed samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffractometry using Cu Kα radiation (PANalytical X'Pert PRO). XRD data were collected in the 2θ° range 10–90° with a nominal scan rate of 120 s per step and a step size of 0.019° at room temperature for all samples. To investigate the variation of lattice parameters with temperature, temperature dependent X-ray data was collected for a precursor mixture that had been ball milled for 10 h followed by annealing at 550 °C for 6 h in the temperature range of 50 °C to 400 °C at 50 °C interval. Annealing and XRD data collection was done under vacuum. Rietveld refinements of XRD powder patterns were performed with the Generalized Structure Analysis System (GSAS) along with the graphical user interface EXPGUI.
Room temperature ionic conductivity measurements of all the prepared solid electrolytes were carried out by impedance spectroscopy (Schlumberger Solartron SI1260) in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 15 MHz using indium plates as electrodes. The samples were transferred into a Swagelok cell in an argon filled glove box. The Nyquist plots (Z′ vs.−Z′′) were derived and analysed using Z plot and Z view software (Version 2.2, Scribner Associates Inc., USA). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the samples ball-milled for 10 h, 15 h as well as the 15 ball milled sample after annealing at 550 °C were collected in the temperature range of 40 °C to 600 °C at 5 K min−1 heating rate under air. The DSC cells were crimped in argon filled glove box.
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) (JEOL JSM-6700F) images were collected at 7 kV voltage for all the samples after annealing. EDX analysis of selected samples was done to confirm the distribution of elements and quantification of elements present. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of selected samples was recorded using an AXIS ultra DLD spectrometer with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (Kratos Analytica). Survey spectra were obtained in the range 0–1200 eV. Charge referencing was carried out against adventitious carbon C (C 1s binding energy = 284.6 eV). Casa XPS software was used to analyse the XPS spectral data.
Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectra of the glasses were recorded on a Varian Excalibur HE 3100 FTIR spectrometer in the wave number range of 400–4000 cm−1 at room temperature with the resolution of 4 cm−1. Spectroscopic grade dry KBr powder and a very small quantity of glass powder were mixed, ground and then compressed to form thin pellets for measurements.
B.Preparation and characterisation of solid state Na–Se batteries
Sodium/Na11Sn2PSe12/C–Se battery
Sodium metal after pressing as sheet is used as anode. C/Se/Solid electrolyte composite is used as cathode material. Super-P carbon black (Sigma-Aldrich) was ball milled with Se in the ratio of 50 : 50. The mixture was annealed at 160 °C under argon atmosphere for 12 h. The samples were again ball-milled for 30 minutes followed by annealing for 12 h at 360 °C. The final composite was achieved by ball milling 30 wt% solid electrolyte and 70 wt% C/Se composite for 30 minutes. XRD, SEM images of C/Se composite and C/Se/Na11Sn2PSe12 were collected as described in the previous section. EDX mapping of electrode before adding solid electrolyte and after adding electrolyte were collected to study the elemental distribution in electrode.
Sodium sheets were attached to the co-pressed Na11Sn2PSe12/composite solid electrolyte pellets for battery testing in Swagelok cells. 0.03 g of sodium, 0.03 g of electrode composite and 0.3 g of electrolyte were used to prepare 13 mm diameter all-solid-state batteries. About 400 MPa pressure was applied to prepare solid electrolyte pellet and 200 MPa pressure was used to add cathode (Sn–Se–SE).Cyclic performance of the batteries was investigated using a potentiostat/galvanostat (Arbin BT2000) at room temperature in the voltage range 0.5–2.5 V vs. Na+/Na.
Na3Sn/Na11Sn2PSe12/SnSe–C–SE battery
The Na3Sn alloy anode was prepared by annealing a Na foil with Sn powder at 60 °C under Ar for 3 hours. Na3Sn/Na11Sn2PSe12/SnSe–C–SE cells were then assembled and tested in Swagelok cells the same way as described above for the Na/Na11Sn2PSe12/SnSe–C–SE cells.
