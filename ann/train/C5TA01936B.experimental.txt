2.Experimental section
2.1Polymer synthesis
2.1.1Materials
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was obtained from Daejung, dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6, 99.9% D) was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 2,6-difluorobenzonitrile from Oakwood products. 2-Methylhydroquinone, bisphenol A, hydroquinone sulfonic acid potassium salt, sodium azide (NaN3), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), toluene, and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were obtained from Sigma. All chemicals were used without further purification.
2.1.2Synthesis of PEEN (poly(ether ether nitrile))
In a three-necked round-bottom flask, fitted with stirrer and a Dean–Stark Trap, 2.78 g (20 mmol) 2,6-difluorobenzonitrile, 2.48 g (20 mmol) 2-methylhydroquinone and 5.52 g potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were dissolved in a mixture of 35 ml anhydrous dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and 31 ml anhydrous toluene. After thorough flushing with nitrogen, the mixture was then heated under stirring at 150 °C for 4 hours, in order to remove the water by azeotropic distillation with toluene. When toluene was completely removed, the suspension was heated at 180 °C until viscosity visibly increased. The reaction mixture was cooled down, the polymer precipitated in DI water, washed for 24 hours and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C for 48 hours. PEEN is soluble in hot NMP, but not well soluble in chloroform, DMSO, DMSO/chloroform, DMSO/0.5 wt% LiCl and tetrahydrofuran.
2.1.3Synthesis of SPEEN (sulfonated poly-(ether ether nitrile sulfone))
2.78 g (20 mmol) 2,6-difluorobenzonitrile, 2.74 g (12 mmol) bisphenol A, 1.83 g (8 mmol) hydroquinone sulfonic acid potassium salt, and 5.52 g potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were dissolved in a mixture of 25 ml anhydrous dimethylacetamide (DMAc) and 31 ml anhydrous toluene. After thorough flushing with nitrogen, the mixture was heated under stirring at 150 °C for 4 hours, in order to remove the water by azeotropic distillation with toluene. When toluene was completely removed, the suspension was heated at 170 °C until the viscosity visibly increased. The reaction mixture was cooled down, the polymer precipitated in DI water, washed for 24 hours and dried under reduced pressure at 60 °C for 24 hours. 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, ppm): 7.19–7.62 (m, ca. 70H, aromatic protons of BPA (7.38 and 7.19 ppm), the hydroquinone sulfonic acid moiety, and the proton in the para-position to nitrile), 6.43–6.77 (m, ca. 20H, aromatic protons in the meta-position to nitrile), and 1.73 (s, 36H, BPA–CH3).
2.1.4Preparation of tetrazole-containing PEEN, SPEEN (TZ-PEEN, TZ-SPEEN)
TZ-PEEN and TZ-SPEEN were prepared and optimized by [2 + 3] addition reaction.17 First, 1 g PEEN or SPEEN was dissolved in 24 ml NMP at 140 °C. NaN3 and anhydrous ZnCl2 with the molar ratio of –CN–ZnCl2–NaN3 1 : 4 : 4 were introduced later into the flasks. The reaction mixtures were stirred at 140 °C for a total of 6 days. The withdrawn samples were heated at 60 °C for 1 hour in dil. HCl, filtered, washed on the filter with dil. HCl followed by water, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60 °C for 24 hours.
2.2Polymer characterization
Chemical structures were characterized using a Bruker 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.
FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Lambda Scientific FTIR 7600 spectrometer with a single bounce diamond ATR accessory with film samples at 4 cm−1 resolution, 16 scans, over the 400–4000 cm−1 range.
2.3Membrane fabrication and acid doping
TZ-PEEN and TZ-SPEEN were dissolved in NMP to obtain 5% wt solutions at room temperature. The solutions were then filtered through polypropylene filters (pore size, 0.45 μm) into Petri dishes and dried at 60 °C, first under ambient pressure for 1 hour and later under vacuum for 24 hours.
The acid doping of the membranes was performed by immersing the membranes in an 85 wt% PA solution at 30 °C, 80 °C or 120 °C. The PA content was measured based on the weight change of the membrane before and after doping. The PA content (wt%) was calculated according to eqn (1), where Wt and W0 are the weights of the membrane after doping and before doping, respectively.1
2.4Mechanical testing
Tensile tests were performed on a Cometech QC-508E universal testing machine. The samples were cut from 1 membrane with the sample size of 1 cm × 4 cm, 4 samples were prepared for each kind of membrane. The samples were stretched at the elongation speed of 10 mm min−1. For each measurement, humidity and temperature were recorded as the mechanical properties greatly depend on environmental conditions. The maximum stress was taken as the tensile strength.
2.5Size exclusion chromatography
SEC was performed on a Shimadzu HPLC Instrument, equipped with 2 PolarSil columns (100 and 300 Å) from Polymer Standards Service (PSS) and a Shimadzu refractive index detector. The samples were run in DMAC containing 0.5 wt% LiCl at 60 °C at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Calibration was made with 17 narrow molecular weight PMMA standards from PSS in the molecular weight range of 800 to 1 600 000 g mol−1 and the LabSolutions GPC Software.
2.6Thermogravimetric analysis
Thermal stability of membranes was measured with TA instruments TGA Q50. Sample weights were around 10 mg, and the temperature was increased 10 °C min−1 from room temperature to 100 °C, kept for 30 minutes, and then again increased at the same heat rate to 900 °C in a nitrogen stream.
2.7Proton conductivity
A Zahner IM6 impedance analyser (ZAHNER-elektrik GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Kronach, Germany) was used to measure electrochemical impedance spectra of membranes. Membrane samples (4 cm × 1 cm) were doped with phosphoric acid and dried at 110 °C for 5 hours to evaporate water. After that, the membrane was measured in the frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz by a 4-probe method. The conductivity σ was calculated according to eqn (2).2where d is the distance between the inner electrodes (1 cm), t and w are the thickness and width (1 cm) of the membrane strip, and R is the resistance [ohm], as obtained from the x-axis intercept of the curve in the Nyquist plot.
2.8MEA fabrication and fuel cell testing
Catalyst powder (46.3% Pt/C from TKK, Japan) and PTFE dispersion (60 wt% in water from Sigma, Korea) were dispersed in isopropyl alcohol and distilled water (IPA : water = 4 : 1 w/w) with a solid PTFE to Pt/C ratio of 1 : 4. The catalyst ink was sprayed uniformly onto a gas diffusion layer (SGL GDL 10 BC) with an automatic spraying machine to prepare gas diffusion electrodes (GDE). The GDEs were then heat treated for 5 minutes at 350 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The Pt loading on each electrode was 1.03 mg cm−2. The MEAs, with an active electrode area of 7.84 cm2, were assembled into a single cell without hot pressing, and the screws were fastened with a torque of 80 pound inch (9.04 N m). The single cells were operated at 160 °C and ambient pressure with non-humidified H2 and air. The gas flow rates were 100 sccm and 300 sccm, respectively. Fuel cell performance was characterized by continuously measuring the potential at a constant current (200 mA cm−2) at 160 °C, and i–V curves.
2.9Computational details
Theoretical calculations with the Density Functional Theory (DFT) methodology using the Becke88 exchange18 and Perdew86 correlation19,20 functional (BP86) were performed using the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program, version 2013.01.21–25 A standard triple-ζ STO basis included in the ADF package with one set of polarization functions was applied for all atoms. Scalar relativistic effects were included by employing the Zero Order Regular Approximation (ZORA).26,27 Charge distribution was analyzed with the Hirshfeld atomic charges28 and molecular electrostatic potential.29,30
