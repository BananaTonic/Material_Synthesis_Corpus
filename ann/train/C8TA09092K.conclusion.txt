4.Conclusion
EPD is conducted in a surfactant-free PVdF–HFP colloidal solution to prepare half lithium ion batteries with a nanostructured PVdF–HFP separator and an integrated separator–anode interface. The as-prepared PVdF–HFP separator has a hierarchically laminated structure, improved mechanical strength with ultra-high ductility, enhanced wettability and excellent thermal stability. The as-deposited separator–anode structure improves the separator–electrode interface and, thus, possesses improved operational safety, efficient production and reduced packing cost. The as-assembled half battery exhibits ultra-high cycle stability and high discharge capacities. Our work, therefore, provides a facile and scalable approach to develop high-performance lithium ion batteries.
