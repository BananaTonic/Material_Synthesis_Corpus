Conclusions
This article describes the fabrication of a new sub-30 μm thick LDPE-based radiation-grafted anion-exchange membrane (RG-AEM). This thin RG-AEM exhibited a OH− anion conductivity of 200 mS cm−1 at 80 °C in a 100% relative humidity atmosphere, which decayed by &lt;7% over a period of 500 h. Fast H2O transport through an AEM is crucial for achieving high-performance anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). We clearly demonstrate that the use of a thinner AEM, synthesised via an optimised grafting process, leads to enhanced in situ H2O transport characteristics without sacrificing mechanical strength. This led to a H2/O2 AEMFC with a peak power density of 2 W cm−2 at 80 °C (Pt/C cathode and PtRu/C anode) and 850 mW cm−2 in a H2/air (CO2-free) AEMFC containing a (non-Pt-group) Ag/C cathode. This thinner RG-AEM has performance characteristics that are now high enough to facilitate detailed investigations into the short- to medium-term AEMFC performances when operating with a variety of parameters (temperatures up to 80 °C, different electrocatalysts, and gas contaminants).
