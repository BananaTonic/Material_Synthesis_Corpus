4.Conclusions
In summary, a simple and novel crown ether lithium salt complex [Li∈12-C-4][I] has been designed, synthesized and characterized with high purity and yield. The thermal behavior of the [Li∈12-C-4][I] based solid-state electrolytes was also investigated in detail. It revealed that the molecular interaction between the crown ether and lithium iodide can effectively transform the liquid state 12-crown-4 into a solid-state complex [Li∈12-C-4][I] with a melting point of 64 °C, which is in the range of interest for solid-state electrolytes. Particularly, the trapping ability of 12-crown-4 to Li+ can obviously reduce the cation–anion (Li+–I−) interaction and hence facilitate favorable electrical properties of the solid-state electrolytes. Therefore, [Li∈12-C-4][I] exhibits an ionic conductivity of 3.93 × 10−5 and 1.53 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 25 and 80 °C, respectively. Further addition of PMII could effectively suppress the crystallization of the complex for more amorphous and smoother regions, which are much more conducive towards higher ion conductivity by the segmental motion of the molecule chains. Therefore, the resulting device showed a PCE of ∼5% and displayed excellent long-term stability. These results offer us more opportunities to explore simple and novel solid-state electrolytes for electrochemical devices.
