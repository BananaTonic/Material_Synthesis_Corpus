Conclusion
In summary, we developed a flexible self-healing HiSE that accommodates extremely high concentrations of LiTFSI and exhibits exceedingly high ionic conductivity and a wide operating voltage. Compared to WiSEs, a 5-fold enhancement in conductivity can be achieved by a 3D Li+ channel inside the hydrogel (51.3 mS cm−1). The unique Li+ channel is surrounded by a polar corona formed by the hydration of the polymer chain, whereby a WiSE-based ultra-high salt-loaded HiSE is obtained. In addition, our HiSE exhibits excellent flexibility, self-healing ability, and mechanical strength, outperforming most reported cases. Leveraging this high reversibility, both an EDLC and ALB were demonstrated, both of which outperform their counterparts. The delicate EDLC assembled with our HiSE can yield an integration of excellent properties, such as a high operating voltage of 2.2 V, a high capacitance of 140.1 F g−1, a large energy density up to 23.54 W h kg−1, and a long-term stability of 91.7% retention after 10 000 cycles. The as-fabricated ALB delivers a high energy density of 110.7 W h kg−1 for 2000 cycles. In particular, the flexibility and self-healing ability of the novel HiSE significantly benefits the application of EDLCs and ALBs, while HiSE-integrated devices exhibit excellent rate performance. Our proposed HiSE can therefore open a new avenue for electrochemical energy storage.
