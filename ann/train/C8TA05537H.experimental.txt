Preparation of materials
Na3SbS4 powders were prepared by a solid-state reaction.9 A stoichiometric mixture of Na2S (Sigma Aldrich), Sb2S3 (99.995%, Sigma Aldrich), and elemental sulfur (99.5%, Alfa Aesar) was sealed in a fused silica ampoule under vacuum and heat-treated at 550 °C. No noticeable reaction between the product and the fused silica ampoule was found. The Na3PS4 powders were prepared by mechanochemical milling of a stoichiometric mixture of Na2S and P2S5 (99%, Sigma Aldrich) for 10 h, followed by heat-treatment at 270 °C for 1 h in a sealed glass ampoule. For the synthesis of NaI·Na3SbS4, the as-prepared Na3SbS4 powders and NaI powders (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) were fully dissolved in anhydrous MeOH (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) and kept under dry Ar for 1 d. For a typical preparation, a solution concentration of 100 mg mL−1 in MeOH was used. After the solvents were removed under vacuum at room temperature, heat-treatment was carried out at different temperatures (150, 200 °C) under vacuum. Heating at higher temperatures of 300 and 550 °C was conducted in a vacuum-sealed fused silica ampoule. For the experiments in which Br was substituted for I, solution-derived NaBr·Na3SbS4 was prepared by following the same procedure as that for NaI·Na3SbS4. The NaI·Na3SbS4-coated FeS2 powders were prepared by following the same MeOH-solution process in the presence of FeS2 (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) powders with a heat-treatment temperature of 200 °C.
Material characterization
XRD cells containing hermetically sealed SE samples with a beryllium window were mounted on a D8-Bruker Advance diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (0.154056 nm), and measured at 40 kV and 40 mA. Raman spectra were measured using a Raman spectrometer (Alpha300R, WITec) with a He–Ne laser source of wavelength 532 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out using Al Kα X-ray radiation (Sigma probe, Thermo Fisher). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were obtained using a model S-4800 instrument (Hitachi Corp.). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image and its corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) elemental mapping images were obtained using a JEM-2100F (JEOL) operating with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The HRTEM image at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV was acquired using an ARM-300F (JEOL). The temperature-dependent 23Na static nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and 1/T1 relaxation rates were measured using a Bruker 400 MHz Avance II+ solid-state NMR at KBSI Seoul Western Center, for which the 23Na resonance frequency was 105.84 MHz. NMR sample powders were sealed in a 4 mm ZrO2 rotor in an Ar-filled glove box; all signals were obtained after a π/2 pulse. Aqueous NaCl solutions (0.1 M) were used for calibration. The Sb K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data were obtained on the BL 10C beamline (wide-energy XAFS) at the Pohang Light Source (PLS) synchrotron with a ring current of 400 mA at 2.5 GeV; the samples for EXAFS measurements were hermetically sealed by coating with a polyimide film under an Ar atmosphere.
Electrochemical characterization
The ionic conductivities of the NaI·Na3SbS4 pellets (diameter = 6 mm) were measured by an AC impedance method, using an IviumStat analyzer (IVIUM Technologies) with Na-ion blocking Ti/SE/Ti cells. For the galvanostatic cycling tests, working electrodes were prepared from the 0.1NaI·0.9Na3SbS4-coated FeS2 or Na3SbS4/FeS2 mixture. For the mixed electrode, Na3SbS4 (conductivity of 1.1 mS cm−1 at 30 °C) prepared by solid-state synthesis at 550 °C was used. Na3Sn alloys (nominal composition), which exhibit a potential of ∼0 V (vs. Na/Na+) upon sodiation/de-sodiation, were prepared by careful mixing of Na metal (Sigma Aldrich) with Sn metal powders (99.8%, Alfa Aesar), and employed as the counter electrode. The SE layer was formed by cold-pressing 120 mg of Na3PS4 powders into a pellet. The as-prepared electrode material (5 mg) was spread on the top of the SE pellet, and then the as-prepared Na3Sn was attached to the other side of the pellet, followed by pressing at 370 MPa. All the procedures were carried out in a polyaryletheretherketone (PEEK) mold (diameter = 13 mm) with two Ti metal rods as the current collectors. The cycling tests were performed at 30 °C in the range 0.6–3.0 V with a current density of 50 or 150 μA cm−2.
Computational details
The first-principles calculations based on DFT were conducted using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) code.43 We adopted the generalized gradient approximation method for describing the exchange–correlation generated by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional.44 A 4 × 4 × 4 k-point grid was chosen using the Monkhorst–Pack method for integrations within the Brillouin zone.45 The energy cut-off for the plane wave basis was set at 520 eV and the force criterion for the structural optimization was 0.001 eV Å−1. The unit cell contained two formula units of t-Na3SbS4, with a = b = 7.1911(8) Å and c = 7.36936(1) Å. Under the assumption that aliovalent doping (which replaces S2− with I−) forms Na3−xSbS4−xIx, a Na vacancy is formed around the I− ion to maintain charge neutrality.
