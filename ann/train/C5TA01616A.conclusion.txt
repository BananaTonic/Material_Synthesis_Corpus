IV.Conclusions
Benefiting from the knowledge established in solid electrolytes of Li-batteries and using first-principles simulations, we have established a thermodynamically stable structure of NGPS, which exhibits a high Na+ conductivity and wide electrochemical window that make it a promising candidate for efficient and safe use in RT-Na–S batteries. The study also presents for the first time the possibility of a single phase in the Na–Ge–P–S system.
The phase stability of the new compound (Na10GeP2S12) is established from its free energy and comparison with the analogous phase of Li (Li10GeP2S12). Based on the consideration of decomposition energies and entropies, it is noted that NGPS is more stable than LGPS, and also has an electrochemical window of 2.7 V which is favourable for Na–S battery operation.
Sodium ionic conductivity is calculated at elevated temperatures (800–1400 K) from ab initio MD calculations, and extrapolated to obtain the same at lower temperatures. The ambient temperature conductivity is found to be higher than that in commercially used polycrystalline β″-alumina and NASICON electrolytes, though it is relatively low at 573 K (operating temperature of Na–S batteries). Soft vibrational modes of Na–S bonds evident in the phonon spectrum are responsible for the high diffusivity of Na+ ions as well as the material's thermodynamic stability.
Preparation techniques of currently used electrolytes such as BASE and Na3Zr2Si2PO12 are energy intensive. They may further need chemical modification to enhance other desirable properties such as mechanical strength. Our results should stimulate experimental studies to synthesize Na10GeP2S12 for electrolyte applications and explore how it is advantageous over existing electrolytes in aspects such as cost, ease of preparation, mechanical stability and safety.
