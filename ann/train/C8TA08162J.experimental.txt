3.Experimental
3.1.Preparation of the precursor glass
The precursor 36Na-glass was prepared by a standard melt-quenching technique. The 36Na-glass was prepared from reagent-grade Na2CO3, Nb2O5, BaCO3, La2O3, and H3PO4 (85 wt%) purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Japan, and GeO2 and B2O3 purchased from Kishida Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan. These chemicals were used as received. The chemicals were weighed and mixed in a platinum crucible and then preheated at 500 °C for 60 min to remove water and CO2 gases from the mixture. The mixture was then melted at 1400 °C for 15 min in air. The molten material was poured into a cylindrical carbon mold with an inner diameter of 18 mm preheated at 450 °C. The obtained glass was annealed at 450 °C for 20 min, and then it was cooled slowly to room temperature at a rate of 20 °C h−1.
3.2.Alkali-proton substitution (APS)
The obtained cylindrical 36Na-glass was sliced into disks with a thickness of approximately 0.8 mm and then both surfaces were polished using emery paper with a grit of #800. A Pd film with a diameter of 16 mm and thickness of 100 nm was deposited on one surface of a 36Na-glass disk by magnetron sputtering (JFC-1600, JEOL, Japan). The disk was loaded onto the specimen holder of the APS apparatus (KDK-800, Kenix Co., Japan) with the Pd-coated surface facing upwards. Full details of the configuration of this apparatus are described in our previous papers.17,18 After the temperature of the disk was increased to 332 °C in 5% H2/95% N2 atmosphere, the lower surface of the disk was contacted with molten Sn. Then, a DC bias of 5–10 V was applied between the Pd film and molten Sn for 6–7 h. The Pd film acted as an anode.
3.3.Characterization
The thermal expansion of the glass was recorded using a thermomechanical analyzer (SS-6000, SII, Japan) to determine its glass transition temperature (Tg) and dilatometric softening temperature (Td). The Na concentration of the glasses before and after APS was determined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; JED-2300, JEOL, Japan) coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JSM-6335F, JEOL, Japan). The concentration of protons forming OH groups in the glasses before and after APS was determined based on the absorbance of the O–H stretching vibration (νOH) using Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy (FT-IR6100, JASCO, Japan) and IR microscopy (IRT-5000, JASCO, Japan). The concentration of OH groups (nOH, in cm−3) was determined from the maximum absorption coefficient of νOH (α(νOH), in cm−1) using the following equation:331nOH = 1.03 × 1019 × α(νOH).
Raman spectra of the glass samples were recorded using a laser Raman spectrometer (NRS-3100, JASCO, Japan) at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
3.4.Electrical properties and fuel cell test
After polishing both surfaces of the glass disk after APS, Pd film electrodes with a thickness of 50 nm were deposited on both surfaces of the disk for the electrical conductivity, electromotive force (emf), and fuel cell measurements. For the electrical conductivity measurements under various oxygen partial pressures (pO2), Pt film electrodes with a thickness of 50 nm were used.
The electrical conductivity of the glass after APS at temperatures between 150 and 400 °C was measured under dry 5% H2/95% N2 atmosphere by the AC impedance method with an impedance analyzer (ModuLab, Solartron Analytical, UK). Electrical conductivity was measured at 280 °C under pO2 of 1.0 × 10−45, 1.0 × 10−43, 1.0 × 10−41, 4.5 × 10−40, 6.3 × 10−3, 2.1 × 10−1, and 1 atm. Mixtures of O2 with N2 and H2 with N2 were used to control pO2 of ≥6.3 × 10−3 and ≤4.5 × 10−40 atm, respectively. The mixed gasses were humidified by passing through water at 8 °C and the partial pressure of water in the mixed gases was fixed at 1.06 × 10−2 atm.
The mean transport number of protons was determined by emf measurements of a hydrogen concentration cell. The structure of the cell used for emf measurements was Gas (I), Pd|glass electrolyte|Pd, Gas (II). Gas (I) was fixed as pure H2, and Gas (II) contained a mixture of H2 and N2 with an H2 content of 5% to 100%. Neither Gas (I) nor Gas (II) was intentionally humidified. The fuel cell test was performed at 280 °C using the glass after APS with a thickness of 0.36 mm as an electrolyte. Dry pure H2 gas and dry air (21% O2/79% N2) were supplied to the anode and cathode, respectively, at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1.
