Synthetic procedures
Synthesis of HCPEs
Synthesis of HCPEs based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and OINs was carried out according to a procedure modified, to some extent, from that described in ref. 29. In a typical experiment for the synthesis of the HCPE based on 55 wt% of OIN, 10 mol% of TEB, and 30 wt% of IL1, 0.8 g of PEG (0.091 mmol) in 5 mL of chloroform was mixed with 0.2 g (1.28 mmol) of lithium triflate in 5 mL of THF. The resultant solution was stirred for 1 hour. The inorganic part of the composite was prepared by a sol–gel reaction of a mixture of GLYMO with TMOS in a molar ratio of 4 : 1, with aluminum-tri-sec-butoxide used as a catalyst. The weighed vial with a stir bar was filled with 2.337 g (9.88 mmol) of GLYMO, 0.426 g (2.81 mmol) of TMOS, 0.04 g (0.16 mmol) of AB, and 0.206 g (1.41 mmol) of triethyl borate (TEB). Hydrolysis of the mixture was initiated by addition of 15% v/w (0.12 mL) HCl (0.01 N solution) needed for complete hydrolysis. After 15 minutes of stirring in an ice bath at 0 °C, the vial was stirred for 15 more minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then charged with 0.64 mL of 0.01 N HCl solution and stirred for 40 minutes at room temperature. Then the reaction temperature was raised to 50 °C and the vial was opened and stirring was maintained for 15 minutes. After weighing the vial, a calculated amount of this precondensed silica solution was added to the PEG and Li salt solution. The amount was determined from the ratio of OIN to PEG + LiTf, and was based on 55% of OIN by weight in the HCPE. After that, 0.66 g of the IL was added to the combined solution. The mixture was then stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. The amount of OIN added was determined by the desired ratio of inorganic component to PEG–LiTf, and was based on a 55 wt% OIN content in HCPE. The desired amount of IL was calculated as a weight fraction of the amounts of PEG and OIN in the sample. Afterward, the reaction solution was placed in two small Teflon dishes on a heater at 70 °C and left overnight for evaporation of solvent and further OIN condensation. The films were treated at 130 °C in a vacuum oven for 1 h to complete condensation. The HCPE films were carefully removed from the dishes and then sealed in a plastic container.
IL1 and IL2 were incorporated in the amounts of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 55 wt% of the total sample weight or until compatibility threshold was met. For example, in the 10 wt% IL1 sample 0.22 g of IL1 was added, while in the 20 wt% IL1 sample 0.44 g of IL1 was added. The conditions of the sample preparation are presented in Tables 1 and S1 (ESI). In the sample notations, the first number stands for the PEG molecular weight, the second number stands for the type of the ionic liquid (see Scheme 1), and the third number indicates the percentage of IL.

Cross-linking density determination
The cross-linking density of HCPE samples was determined through a solvent swelling technique.47,48 The technique is based on measuring the amount of solvent the polymer network in the sample absorbs. To remove the ILs from HCPE, 0.6 g of each dry sample were weighed and put into a small tared vial. The sample was stirred overnight in 2 mL of THF. After that, THF was decanted and the procedure was repeated five times. To validate the completeness of the IL removal, the fifth THF extract was analyzed by 1H NMR in CD3CN using a Varian 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. After the IL extraction, 2 mL of fresh THF was added to the HCPE sample and allowed to swell overnight. The non-absorbed THF was decanted from the vial, after which the vial was weighed to obtain a swollen sample weight. After this was recorded, the sample was dried in the same vial in a vacuum oven overnight. A weight of the sample was recorded after drying. Using the ratio of the weights of the dry and swollen samples, the Flory–Rehner equation was used to determine the cross-linking density:49,50where υ2 (V/V0) is the ratio of unswollen (V) and swollen samples (V0), φ1 is the molar volume of the solvent used, and χ1 is the Flory interaction parameter. The Flory interaction parameter was treated as a constant to calculate relative cross-linking densities.
Characterization
Conductivity was measured as follows. The samples were vacuum-dried at room temperature overnight to minimize the effects of water absorption on measurements. Using a micrometer, the thickness of the sample polymer film was determined. Gold contacts of the area of 1.18 × 10−5 ± 0.05 m2 were coated directly onto the polymer films by using a Polaron E5100 sputter coater. Sputtering of the gold was accomplished in 3 minutes, and during this time the samples were held at 5 °C. After the gold was sputtered, electrodes were attached, and each sample was placed into a measurement rig and attached to an LF impedance analyzer. The oscillation level of the applied pulse was 1 V over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 10 MHz at room temperature. The samples were modeled to a parallel circuit comprised of a resistor and capacitor. Admittance data was recorded using this circuit model and subsequently converted to obtain impedance plots. Current cycling experiments on samples with lithium metal contacts were carried out in a glovebox with an argon atmosphere. Current was held constant while measuring the voltage drop in the circuit using a Keithley K236 source-measure meter unit, with current changing direction every 1000 seconds.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed with a TA Instruments Q Series calorimeter. Sample masses varied from 5 to 20 mg and were hermetically sealed in aluminum pans. The samples were scanned between −80 and +200 °C at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1, using refrigerated cooling systems (RCS) as the coolant. Glass transition regions were then determined using the fictive temperature method.
All 1H and 29Si magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker DSX Avance NMR spectrometer with a 9.4 T magnet (400.25 MHz 1H Larmor frequency, 79.52 MHz 29Si Larmor frequency) using a probe head for 7 mm rotor diameters. The samples were spun between 5.0 kHz and 1.8 kHz; the centrifugal expulsion of liquid rendered faster spinning unstable for the gel like materials. For sample 300-IL1-10, a 29Si cross-polarization (CP)/MAS NMR spectrum was acquired by accumulating 1800 transients using a 5 ms CP contact pulse duration, ramped proton power, TPPM decoupling and 4 s recycle delays. CP power conditions were set with Kaolin, whose resonances also served as a secondary chemical shift standard at −91.34 ppm (center between doublet) relative to TMS. In addition, 29Si MAS data with direct, 90 degree pulse excitation and TPPM proton decoupling were acquired for representative samples. A repetition time of 30 s seemed to produce a reasonable signal when accumulating 128 scans. Due to low signal-to-noise ratio, no relaxation time measurements were performed, rendering the 29Si NMR spectra non-quantitative.
The 1H MAS NMR spectra were acquired with single pulse excitation of 5.0 μs corresponding to a 45 degree flip angle adding 8 transients. The 5 s experimental repetition delay matched or exceeded 5 times the longest 1H NMR spin lattice relaxation times, T1, as determined by inversion-recovery sequences. The chemical shift scale was calculated relative to the 29Si chemical shift reference, using the IUPAC conversion factor.51
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV on a JEOL JEM1010 transmission electron microscope. A piece of the HCPE sample was embedded in epoxy resin and cut very finely with a diamond knife. Images of the resulting thin sections (ca. 50 nm thick) were obtained and analyzed with the ImageJ software.
Mechanical properties of the SPEs were measured using a TA RSAIII DMA using a parallel plate compression geometry. Film diameters were 7.87 mm and thickness ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 mm. Strain sweeps from 10−3 to 101% strain were run at 25 °C and frequency of 1 Hz to determine viscoelastic regime. Frequency sweeps were run at 25 °C and a strain of 0.1% with a minimum normal force of 0.1 N.
