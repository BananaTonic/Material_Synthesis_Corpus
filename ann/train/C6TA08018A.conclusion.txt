Conclusions
In summary, this study reported PVA-g-PAA/KCl hydrogel electrolytes with good flexibility, high ionic conductivity, and excellent healing efficiency/cyclability for electrochemical capacitors. It was revealed that dynamic diol–borate ester bonding was the main driving force for the excellent self-healing capability under ambient conditions. The grafting of PAA was an important factor improving the self-healing behavior, mechanical properties and salt tolerance of the electrolyte, since the grafted PAA effectively alleviated the coagulation of PVA chains caused by inorganic salts. Taking advantage of the unique self-healing capability, we also assembled a smart electrochemical capacitor with healable and tailorable features for the first time. Considering that dynamic diol–borate ester bonding can be introduced through molecular design, a wide range of hydrogel electrolytes are expected to be synthesized aiming for smart energy-storage devices with flexible, wearable, self-healable and even tailorable properties.
