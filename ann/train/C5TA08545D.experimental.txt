3.Results and discussion
3.1.Chemical composition and homogeneity
An SEM-BSE picture of the embedded crystals is shown in Fig. 2. The single crystals were about 100–200 μm in size; the microelectrodes were about 28 μm in size. The qualitative composition of the single crystals obtained by SEM-EDS measurements (without Li) indicates almost perfect agreement between the measured and the intended chemical composition. The crystals within one compositional batch show no significant variation in stoichiometry. The single crystals have no pores, indicating a density of 100%, therefore a possible impact of morphology and microstructure on the electrochemical properties can be excluded. The obtained analytical results using ICP-OES are listed in Table 3. In general, the analytical atomic ratios in Table 3 reflect very well the nominal composition.

(2) In contrast, the amounts of Al and Ti are systematically slightly larger than expected, indicating that there might occur a small partial substitution of P with Al and/or Ti and result in a systematic non-stoichiometry in the crystals. (3) The amount of Li is also always about 0.5–1% larger than expected. Since the crystals were exposed to 1000 °C for one month, it can be concluded that the small stoichiometric deviations seem to be the equilibrated compositions.
3.2.Impedance spectra of LTP and LATP single crystals
Impedance spectra were measured on the embedded polished single crystals of all compositions. Fig. 5a and b display the relevant data measured at RT.
Impedance spectra of (a) LTP and (b) LATP samples with different Al contents measured at room temperature. Data can be compared without normalization due to the same electrode geometry.
LTP shows a complete high frequency semicircle. In the impedance spectra of the LATP samples the minimum of |Zim| indicates the beginning of the high frequency semicircle. Common to all spectra is a strong increase of the imaginary part of the impedance towards low frequencies with an almost constant angle in the complex impedance plane.
This low frequency impedance can be attributed to the electrode response and described by a resistance in parallel to a constant phase element (CPE2) with impedance7ZCPE = 1/(iω)nQ,where ω is the phase frequency and the exponent n is a fit parameter reflecting the nonideal behavior of the capacitance. This electrode equivalent circuit is needed to analyze the sample-specific high-frequency arc of LATP samples, but does not provide any mechanistic information. The high-frequency arc represents the resistivity of the individual single crystals. The resistive part of the arc is simply fitted by a resistance element (Rb) and can be attributed to the volumetric Li+ conduction (σb). The bulk capacitance (Cb) of LTP and LATP samples cannot be obtained, due to the unavoidable stray capacitance (C1) (C1 ≫ Cb) introduced by the measurement set-up; here, C1 is in the 100 fF range. The equivalent circuit used to fit the impedance spectra of LTP and LATP is shown in the inset of Fig. 6 displaying representative fit examples of LTP and LATP with x = 0.4.

For two microelectrodes in some distance, the approximation9R = (dσb)−1is obtained and this was used to calculate σb from the R values given in Table 4.

Since eqn (9) is an approximation, finite element calculations were employed to test its accuracy for measurements on small single crystals. On the one hand, the limited distance between the microelectrodes lowers the resistance compared to the idealized formula. On the other hand, the limited size of the single crystal enhances the resistance. This was quantified for different sample sizes and positions of microelectrodes (see Fig. 4 and Table 2).
Current I and resistance R obtained by calculating the current density of the geometries used (e.g., case 1 as illustrated in Fig. 7) are given in Table 3. The corresponding correction factors f are also summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 8.

The current calculated for the (close-to-reality) geometries of cases 1–3 was in the range of 1.59–1.67 × 10−9 A, whereby the current decreased with a decreasing depth (c) of the box or when the microelectrodes move towards one edge. The correction factors f were in the range of 0.90 to 0.92, which represents an error of &lt;10% in determining R from eqn (9).
In case 4, a cubic box that was one-third smaller than that in case 1 was chosen. Interestingly f = 1, which means there was no error in accuracy due to the compensation of distance and the size of the box (see above).
When the geometry was chosen to be very nonideal (case 5), an error of 27% was obtained. Factor f should also approach 1 in the case of a very large box with microelectrodes at large distances from each other. As shown for cases 6–10, the f values converged to a value of f = 1.01, which indicates that the numerical calculations are reliable. Overall, this shows that eqn (9) is appropriate to calculate Li+ bulk conductivities from MC IS measurements on small single crystals. Deviations due to differently sized single crystals or different microelectrode positions are generally in the 10% range.
3.4.The Li+ conductivity of LTP and LATP single crystals
The σb values of LTP and LATP single crystals are shown in Fig. 9 and given in Table 4.
Li+ bulk conductivity (σb) of LATP as a function of Al3+ content. Error bars indicate the deviation of 20 measurements on different single crystals within one composition.
3.4.1.Electrochemical homogeneity
The σb value of LTP is 2.81 × 10−6 S cm−1, which is in agreement with values reported previously (e.g., ref. 11). The only exception is the value of 1.6 × 10−3 S cm−1 as reported by Arbi et al. (note: this value is similar to values obtained for LATP).10
The relative standard deviation of σb values obtained from 20 different single crystals is 36%, which is about three times larger than values obtained from LATP samples (see Table 4). This is most probably related to slight compositional inhomogeneities, which remain undetected by conventional characterization methods (e.g., SEM-EDS), as proposed by Wang et al.12 They observed two partly overlapping bulk arcs in the complex impedance plane of LTP samples, which they attributed to two electrically different regions within grains or single crystals caused by chemical inhomogeneities, such as core and shell (see below), even though the sample appeared to be structurally phase-pure and consisted of well-grown grains. They evaluated two different σb contributions from the different electrical regions and the values obtained from the reported Arrhenius plot are comparable to values measured here.12
The two arcs seen in the former study cannot be distinguished in our case due to the unavoidable stray capacitance, which makes the bulk capacitance inaccessible for analysis and also prevents a separation of two overlapping semicircles. Hence, it remains unknown whether inhomogeneities exist, even within one grain, or whether variations are present.
Arbi et al. made analogous observations for LATP samples.23 They explained this phenomenon with the existence of a Li-poor shell structure and an Al-rich core for samples with low Al3+ content. The increase in Al3+ in LATP leads to a homogeneous grain composition and therefore to a single electrical bulk response.23 Since in our samples containing 0.1–0.5 Al3+ per formula unit (pfu) no significant Li+ conductivity variation was observed, we conclude that there is chemical homogeneity within the LATP single crystals studied in this work. The incorporation of 0.1 Al3+ pfu leads to an increase in σb of three orders of magnitude (σb = 1.73 × 10−3 S cm−1), which is in agreement with results for samples of the same composition reported previously.10
3.4.2.The origin of the enhanced σb
In order to understand the origin of the high Li+ bulk conductivity observed for LATP samples, Wang et al. performed a detailed impedance spectroscopy study in a wide temperature range (60 °C to −150 °C). For low temperatures, they were able to reveal the high-frequency arc in the complex impedance plane, i.e., the feature due to Li+ bulk conductivity and bulk permitivity.12 Based on a previous study by Aono et al., who found a significant decrease in bulk and grain boundary resistance as a function of density in LTP/LATP ceramics,9,11 they concluded that there is a correlation between the low conductivity of LTP and the low density of those materials.
In contrast, Lang et al. recently published a detailed investigation on the role of the local structure of substitution variants of LTP on Li+ mobility by means of density functional theory (DFT).24 They showed that additional Li+ is introduced by substituting Ti4+ by Al3+ and located in an energetically favored site (M3). This occupation induces the nearest-neighboring M1 site to displace towards the next M3 site, which promotes an interstitial migration mechanism, in agreement with observations made by NMR spectroscopy.10 This diffusion mechanism is limited as a 1D pathway with Ea = 0.19 eV. An activation energy Ea of 0.20 eV is necessary to rearrange Li+ in corresponding sites to open 3D diffusion in the Li+ sublattice. Both Ea values are significantly lower compared to the activation energy in LTP (Ea = 0.46(5)).10
Although the LTP and LATP samples in this study have identical relative densities and the crystal structural relationships by introducing Al3+ into the LTP structure are almost linear, nevertheless σb shows an increase of three orders of magnitude. Therefore, density and crystal structure can be excluded as reasons for enhanced Li+ conduction.
The logical conclusion is that the increase in σb is based only on the incorporation of the additional Li+ ions as highly mobile charge carriers opening the fast-diffusion pathways in the LTP-NASICON structure, as discussed by Lang et al. (see above).24
3.4.3.σb of LATP as a function of the Al3+ content
The influence of the amount of Al3+ in LATP on σb is still a matter of discussion. As an example, Arbi et al. performed 7Li NMR and EIS studies and found an increase in σb with an increasing amount of Al3+ (up to x = 0.2).10 Above x = 0.2, the grain interior conductivity remained almost constant, which was connected with an upper incorporation limit of Al3+ in LATP for their synthesis route. In contrast, Forsyth et al. and Takada et al. showed by using 7Li NMR that the increase in the amount of Al3+ only introduced minor changes in the line widths, which indicates a minor influence of Al3+ on the Li+ motion within the grain.25,26 In addition, Wang et al. (see also above) interpreted their impedance spectroscopy study in such a way that Al3+ did not significantly affect σb in LATP samples, whereby the maximum σb (7.7 × 10−3 S cm−1) was observed for samples with x = 0.4.12
The Li+ conductivity in our study is the true Li+ bulk conductivity and is not affected by the microstructure of a polycrystal. We clearly observed a significant increase as a function of the Al3+ content up to x = 0.4 (up to 5.63 (±0.68) × 10−3 S cm−1), which is in contrast to the aforementioned studies. For LATP crystals with x = 0.5, σb decreases slightly to 4.70 (±0.80) × 10−3 S cm−1. Very recently, the bulk conductivity of LATP with x = 0.5 was separated from grain boundary contributions by impedance spectroscopy down to 123 K. Extrapolating the low-temperature data to RT, a value of 3.4 × 10−3 S cm−1 was derived, which is in very good agreement with our measurements.13
This increase in σb can be most probably attributed to increasing amounts of Li+ occupying the M3 sites and displacing the Li+ in M1 sites towards the nearest-neighboring M3 sites. Therefore, the additional Li content further promotes the Li+ diffusion, as discussed by Lang et al.24 and Arbi et al.,10 and further supported by the equivalent isotropic displacement parameter of our SCXRD study (see above). The resulting slight decrease in σb above x = 0.4 can be related to the intrinsic process described by Lang et al.24 Li+, which is needed for charge balancing the substitution of Ti4+ by Al3+, favorably occupies the M3 site next to a substituted Al3+. This leads to a successive trapping of Li+ as a function of the Al3+ content, which possibly becomes predominant with a critical amount of Al3+ in the lattice and slightly reduces the mobility of displaced Li+ ions, which originally promoted the diffusion behavior in the LTP–LATP system.
