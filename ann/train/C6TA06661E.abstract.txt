Hydroxide conductivity and alkaline stability are challenging issues for anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, a novel sandwiched anion exchange membrane (AEM) was prepared from porous bromomethylated poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (BPPO) entrapped cationic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) coating on the two sides. The porous BPPO matrix prepared by a non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) method provides numerous interconnected nanopores and sponge-like walls and enhanced uptake of alkali. The entrapped cationic MOFs can work as OH− conductive channels while the PVA coating can block the crossover of fuels such as methanol. The final membranes can reach an OH− conductivity of 145 mS cm−1 at 80 °C and a methanol permeability of 3.68 × 10−7 cm2 s−1, the performance of which is much higher than that in the existing literature.
