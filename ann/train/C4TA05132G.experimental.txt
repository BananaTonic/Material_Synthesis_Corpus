2.Experimental details
Synthesis
Precursor powders (10 grams) containing a stoichiometric mixture of La2O3 (99.998% Alfa Aesar), CaCO3 (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and Ga2O3 (99.999%, Aldrich) were ground and homogenized in ethanol, dried in air (100 °C/6 hours), and then fired (800 °C/10 hours) to decompose CaCO3. The La2O3 was dehydrated and decarbonated (1000 °C/10 hours) before use. The calcines were reground, pressed into pellets (for powder analysis) or two rods (that served as feed and seed rods for single crystal growth) and sintered (1400 °C/12 hours/air) to yield single phase products. Single crystals of [Ca1−xLa1+x]2[Ga]2[Ga2O7+x/2]2 (0 ≤ x &lt; 0.6) were grown using an optical floating zone furnace, with the growth speed of ∼0.1 to 1 mm hour−1 in air (Fig. S1).
Single crystal X-ray diffraction
A single crystal (0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.08 mm) was cleaved and mounted on a glass fibre. Data were collected using a Bruker Smart Apex II single crystal diffractometer (X-ray radiation Mo Kα, λ = 0.71073 Å), over an angular range of 2.08° ≤ θ ≤ 37.84°, with an exposure time of 30 s (step size: 0.5 degree) to give a total collection time of ∼7 hours. The Saint module, deployed within Apex II, was used for reflection integration, performing Lorentz polarization and multi-scan absorption corrections. The data were analyzed using JANA2006 11 and no extra absorption correction was applied.
Single crystal neutron diffraction
Measurements were carried out using the single crystal diffractometer SXD instrument installed at the ISIS pulsed neutron source,12 with an array of two-dimensional position-sensitive detectors. This neutron time-of-flight Laue technique can measure diffraction data through a very large volume of reciprocal space. A single crystal was fixed on an aluminium pin with adhesive Al tape and mounted on a closed-cycle refrigerated holder. Measurement was conducted at room temperature, and structure determination was carried out using JANA2006.
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
Patterns were collected on a Bruker Advance D8 X-ray diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The powders were mounted onto a top-loaded holder and data collected from 2θ 5–130° using a step size of 0.02° with an exposure time of 1 s per step. Rietveld refinement was applied using TOPAS V4.1.13
Scanning electron microscopy
Polycrystalline pellets were examined by secondary electron images (SEI) obtained with a scanning electron microscope (JEOL 5410) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) operating at 10–15 keV. To remove the excess charge, the samples were gold sputter coated before attaching with double sided carbon tape to an aluminum stage.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Single crystals were crushed under ethanol and deposited on holey carbon films supported by a copper grid. High resolution image (HRTEM) and select area diffraction pattern (SAED) were collected using a JEOL 2100F operated at 200 kV and fitted with a Gatan Ultra CCD camera.
Impedance spectroscopy
For the conductivity measurements of the polycrystalline pellets of [La1+xCa1−x]2[Ga]2[Ga2O7+x/2]2 (0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.6), the pellets were coated on both sides with a Pt paste, and then heated to 800 °C for 1 hour to ensure bonding to the electrolyte. Ionic conductivities were measured by alternating current (AC) impedance spectroscopy (Hewlett Packard 4192A impedance analyzer). The experiments were conducted from 500 to 800 °C in air at an applied AC voltage of 0.1 V from 5 Hz to 13 MHz. The impedance data showed a single semicircle, from which it was not possible to extract the bulk component, and hence total conductivity data are reported. Single crystals were cut into disks, with a Au paste coated onto both sides, and then heated to 750 °C to ensure bonding, using a procedure commonly applied to polycrystalline ceramic pellets.14 The experiments for single crystals were conducted from 600 to 850 °C in air at an applied AC voltage of 10 mV from 100 MHz to 400 kHz.
